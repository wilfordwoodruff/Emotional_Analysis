July 31, 1856 Letter to G. A. Smith from W. Woodruff ENDENTRY This page the reverse of previous page ENDENTRY Hon. G. S. L. city Feby. 2 1857.  Dear Sir,  We have not received an Eastern mail for some three months, we sent out the Jan. mail for the East, they got to the top of the first mountain and found much snow, and one of the company froze to death (not a mormon) and the company returned, we have received the California mail regularly up to this time, but the last mail had to come through much snow. we are not looking for another Southern mail daily, we have never seen as much snow in these mountains and vallies in any season since we have been here, over eight feet has fallen in theis city, and the mountains are full, the snow has been for weeks between 2 and 3 feet deep in this city, about 3 feet on the Island, all the stock has been brought from there and taken south and fed at home and some sent to Rush valley where the stock have done well, there has been but little stock lost this season. business is very dull this season not much money in circulation, most all goods that are sold among the merchants have to be sold for stock or grain. I have not taken either, and have sold but few goods, your family are all well and doing well as far as I know, It is a general time of health, we adjourned the Legislature to this city as you have heard, we have had the best season we have ever had in this Territory.  Our reformation has continued with great interest throughout this city and Territory, the Twelve have been at the head of the Missionaries and I have attended some meeting about every night for the last 3 months, F. D. Richards and myself have been the only ones of the Twelve here, except L. Snow who have been with us during the Legislature. O. Hyde has gone South, and L. Snow to Box Elder. I forwarded to you last Fall a letter to assist me getting some grafts from Wm. R. Prince and Coy. Flushing New York. I never heard from you whether you received it or ENDENTRY last Sunday night in council from Lyman Wight to Father Porter, trying to establish that the true church is with him upon the common stock principle.  Washington County; all well south.  The eastern mail ^arrived^ on the 28th inst; it brought but few letters, and the Letter mail bags which were missing of last mail are not heard from,  and probably never will be. I received a letter from you, and in reply would say I have paid Miss Burbage all demands up to this date. She is now married to John V. Long the Reporter, but still keeps schools.  I will keep you advised of all matters pertaining to the Mill as far as I get them. Bror. Houtz has made some drafts on you, but he is still owing you as you will see from the Bill I sent you by the 1st June mail.  Mrs. Pratt put into my hands a letter from Dr. Asa Fitch directed to  O. Pratt by your introduction. He wishes some one to send him some grasshoppers and other insects from this Territory; they are very scarce this season, but I think by diligent search we ^can^ find enough to supply his demand.  I remain Dear Sir With great respect Your friend Wilford Woodruff by Thomas Bullock. Clerk.

V. Jones has started to examine it and to commence smithing it. Elder McCarthy who was shipwrecked on one of the Society Island has baptized the Interpeter to the King who He speaks 12 Languages, also the Interpeter to the Government company He speaks 5 Languages. He ordained them both Elders and started the Gospel in the midst of the people, so it was not in vain without some good that He was shipwrecked. I wish our Deligates to Washington could pull some wire that would work a charge in the Mail operations for Utah for after waiting from October to the 10th of May for a Mail, 24 bags of mail matters near one half Due is still back to fill up and Holes, or for some other purpose. Broth Bullock says that the U.S. has been Delivered of half a mail and being 5 month old looks for the other half to be born out of Due time but when we cannot tell Mr McGraw has had an increase of 17000 Dollars to Reimburse him for his hard labour and has his contract increased to 35000 to indorse him to be Delivered twice a year as we suppose The clerk of General Store has Reported that that the carrier informed him that his orders were from McGraw that when He started with the Salt Lake mail and came to any streams that was high not to attempt to cross it but to Return to Salt Lake untill the waters was down ENDENTRY has rested upon him and his spirit has been more church than ever, and his heart made more glad than ever before, in seeing the Saints arise to a sense of their duties. The people throughout the Territory are arising en masse to their duty, in confessing and repenting of their sins, the Tabernacle is filled to overflowing through these winter months and hundreds have to leave each Sunday that cannot get in, Elder Kimball has preached the last few Sundays in the greatest plainness without any regard to false traditions of the people, the power of God has rested upon him. The Twelve have gone forth through this city under the direction of Prest. Young and stood at the head of the missionary operation, and attended all the Quorum meetings of the Seventies, High Priests, Bishops and Ward meetings, and the power of God has rested upon us, as never before, and the people begin to realize in a measure that there are apostles in their midst. I have attended a meeting of some kind almost every evening for the past three months, and I have never felt as much of the Spirit of God as during this Winter. I labored with J. M. Grant until he died, I then labored in company with F. D. Richards, after he came home and finally L. Snow both arrived in this city and they labored with us a short time. Elder Snow has gone up to Box Elder, and O. Hyde has gone South to hold meetings, and get something to help himself with. All our ward school houses are filled to overflowing during the worst weather and even could you now attend a meeting in Provo, you would be astonished to see hundreds of people striving to get a seat in their places of worship, and should a notice be given out that Geo. A. Smith would preach in that place, instead of seeing the coldness that was formerly manifest almost the entire people would flock out to hear.

We hope, trust and pray with a good deal of faith that you in connexion with our two honorable delegates sent by the convention will make a three fold cord that cannot be broken in Washington, but that it will be found strong enough when hitched on to Utah Territory to draw it into the State of Deseret. We shall look forward with feelings of the deepest interest to learn the result which will emanate from the labors of that most important and interesting Tribune which ever met in the councils of our Nation to plead for the rights of a State or Territory since the foundation of our great Republic. We know God will be with you in your united efforts. He will guide you in your destiny, as delegates and representatives of Deseret, as he did our Fathers of the first Congress. God had his work to perform then—he accomplished it. He has decreed a greater work now, that work he will perfect. He will carefully guard it and his servants too, and I feel to say to one and all of our worthy delegates let your hearts be comforted all will be just right, do your best and trust it in the hands of God, you all have the daily prayers of the righteous, if there are any on the earth.

T. March 323rd 1856  Elder Taylor  Dear Sir  I have received a mission to the States this spring the object of which is to get a font of type east in the letter of the Deseret Alphabet and then to get some school books printed in the same. President Young wishes me to get this work accomplished so that some of the Books can be brought to this city next fall. I hardly think it can be accomplished in time to get Books through this season but I do not know. I will start out with the missionaries that go east this spring but I do not think that we can get any before the first of May the mountains are so full of snow we cannot travel. I wish you would do me the favor to make Enquiry whare you think we can get this job done to the best advantage ie to get the type made, the printing will of course be an after consideration  I have thought we could get the type cast in Cincinnati or New York as well as any place. when it comes to printing we ought to have one or two of the Bretheren engaged in it who are printers that would be interested in it as it will be in a New Letter and will require considerable time and attention in the type setting and proof Reading andc  After getting what information you can upon these matters from the type fonderies in New York Cincinnati andc you will do me a favor by forwarding a letter to me Directed at Cin St Louis Mo ENDENTRY Historian's Office  Great Salt Lake City, May 29th 1856  Hon. John Taylor,  I presume you will not have any objection to receiving a monthly letter from me now I have entered upon my duties as Historian and therefore commence by saying I am just recovered from a four weeks' sickness caused by the poisonous virus inoculating my arm when skinning an ox which had died very suddenly; it came very near carrying me into another state of existence, but by kind attention, frequent administrations, and the continued prayers of the saints my life is spared to continue my labors on this earth.  On the 10th of this month our eyes were astonished to see a U. S. mail come into the valley from the east loaded with about one half of the letters and papers that had left Independence since last October; the remainder, Mr. McGaw (the contractor) or his agent had very considerately cached by the way, or perhaps left at Fort Laramie for worn out, tired out soldiers to read through the long winter nights, when tired of talking about their victory over a few semi savages, and half starved ignorant remnants of Indian tribes, and they would also naturally be anxious to read the correspondence of a people who believe in Polygamy.  Although I write you under this date it is impossible to prophesy when you will receive it, as I learn from a reliable source that Mr. McGaw told his agent that when he came with the mail from Salt Lake if he came to any stream that was deep not to attempt to cross it, but return to Salt Lake again, and stay until the waters are down, for it would be all right, as the government had reimbursed Mr. McGaw $17,000 this trip, and $35,000 for last contract. I do not vouch for this, but give it you as I received it, and it is casually believed here.

I wrote you upon the subject of ny going East to get a font of type made in the Deserett Alphabet and some Books printed in that letter. Since I wrote we have passed through some changes during our interesting General Conference, and among other things my mission is changed I was appointed by the conferene to assist in the Historians office So I remain at Home, and the intentions now is to have Brother Erastus Snow to get the type made and forward it to this place and paper and binding materials and forward it to this place so we will do our printing here. Brother Snow will manage this matter on his arrval to St Louis You will learn by this Mail that yourself with Elder G A.

We are thinking of taking a tour North as far as Salmon river Settlement andc., in the Spring instead of going South as we have done in former seasons. We are now having a great thaw, and the streets are filled with Snow broth, and some places are getting bare and the stock will soon live, but few of the stock have died this winter in comparison with what we lost last Season. It is a general time of health this winter but comparison with what very few deaths. Your family are all well and the families of all the brethren with you in the States. There is one thing I wish you to do for me and for the benefit of the people in this Territory. we have received the Pamphlets con- taining the account of the Diascorea batatas or new chinese Potatoe as 1 1/6 now growing in the garden of Flushing N.

Kerr lost their entire herd, valued at $60,000, and all the citizens in proportion. Hundreds of persons have lived on dead cattle when the could be got at for snow, and now it has disappeared they are living on weeds, roots, and greens.  Although we have had the grasshopper plague, and the excessive drouth of last summer, and the unparalelled severe winter, now they have disappeared, every face is beaming with gladness, because the hand of the Lord has been seen in his mercifully sending the rains once a week this Spring, which causes the wheat to rise from the ground as a  harbinger of "the good time coming boys;" many are anxiously expecting to cut wheat by the 20th June, and then we'll have a jubilee.  The Potatos, Corn, Squash, Peas, and other vegetables look well, and we expect to reap a bountiful harvest to feed those who are here, and those who are wheeling the barrows over the plains; so be of good cheer, all is well in Zion.  I am happy to learn that your agents have obtained subscribers for 780 out of the 800 copies of the Mormon sent here; it is a truly valuable paper, and merits an extensive circulation. It is highly approved here, and if the people could be assured of the mail bringing what is sent at Utah, you would have a more extended patronage. We wish you to preserve a good file for the Historian's Office, and bring it with you, or send by some trusty elder when he emigrates to the valley of peace, having previously got it well bound.

And that in concerning your family affairs that part of your  family that live in the 19 ward have been Entering complaints against your first wife  and in a measure against you for not providing better for them. the Bishop of  the ward took up the subject and I then furnished them with some promis they who applyed to the tithing office and drew from there ^some of the^ Men promis while they were drawing at the same time from Mrs pratt they finally Entered  complaint to the president giving him a Bill of what they had received (as they say) and also saying that sister pratt Had received $600 from Liverpool and would not provid for them andc the consequence was that Elder F D Richards and  myself was called upon to call the family together and investigate the matter Elder Hyde  and myself Attended F. D. Richards did not but I told them both my feelings upon the  subject. I was somewhat accqainted with sister pratts cause in the matter. Brother  Hyde has Had one side of the question I the other I told him He would find two sides to it, when we met we did. I think all the family from the 19 ward manfested a bad  spirit and badly misrepresented things. It was then clearly shown that there was not  but a small portion of the provisons and things in the Bill which they received and it was  also shown that it was not true that sister pratt had received $600 from Liverpool but it questioned the $400 ofCredit of Hooper store and that mostly went to pay Debts formerly contracted, and I Belive Brother Hyde was satisfied that they had a bad spirit  and misrepresented sister pratt. we both gave them good council I told them they should  act for your interest and maintain your honour while you was gone. I told them  if they did not unite with sister pratt and try to get along wiell they would not prosper  but would bring trouble upon themselves. I felt and do believe that sister pratt is doing  all she can to make them comfortable and I do not think that there was any occasion to make the complaints they have.

Oh consistency! has thou entirely fled from the United States? if so, when wilt thou return? The difficulties of crossing the rivers are really awful, for a very respectable lady over 70 years of age has started with oxen to go the Missouri river, and I think Mr. McGaw is sadly to blame in not engaging her to carry the mail, and then pay her for the odd trip. Brother Taylor, can you inform me how it is that your letters via South Pass, and your Duplicates by way of California, all come in the same letter bag? Your letters are not the only ones that so strangely come together.  Your letter to Bishop Hunter was read in the council last Sunday; all were glad to hear from you, and suppose 'ere this you have learned your destiny—that you have to stay at Washington a little longer; we all pray that you and your colleagues may be prospered in your exertions on behalf of the fair vales of Deseret, and that you may win laurels for yourself and co-workers with you.  I am happy to inform you that all your family are well; Sister Taylor visited me the other day in good health and spirits.  The Presidency and Twelve are well—also their families, with the exception of Sister Mary Ann Young who is now prostrated through her continued exertions in administering to the necessities of so many who were destitute this past season; she is a little easier to day.  We learn by Madam Rumor that General Harney has been ordered by the Government to march his troops to the scene of the Indian Wars in Oregon, and that he expects to replenish his supplies when passing through the Northern part of this Territory; if this is true he is bound to be disappointed, for the severe winter has killed four out of every five head of cattle in the Northern Counties; the desolation is deplorable, ENDENTRY respects to Hon.

The Weather has been dry and warm since I last wrote to you. we have had 2 slight showers during the past month. Barley harvesting commenced last monday the 23rd and some wheat in the big field was cut on Saturday last. Much of the crops however have suffered materially for the lack of water; by good management and much physical labor the waters of the  Big Cotton wood have been brought Northward as far as Kanyon creak by way of the canal, and have been used on the 10 and 5 acre lots, which will help some fields of grain that would have been almost an entire failure; br J. Wright reports the wheat crops for 3 miles around Fort Brigham completely eat up by Grasshoppers. The tobacco worm in great numbers are eating up the Potatoe vines, but we manage to kill them, for they soon grow so large they are easily seen. Many fields of wheat look well and the city Gardens promise much, but city kanyon creek is very low.  The arrangements of the committee for the national celebration of the 4th of July, have been made on a large scale. We will have a grand military Review and the Legion are making preparations accordingly. A copy of the programme has been forwarded to you by the post office.  Prests.

Bro: Cannon I have a fine orchard of 50 seedling apple trees growing, about one half of them begin to bear fruit for the first time this season.

Sir,  The only mail from the east by way of the South Pass since last October arrived here on the 10th. inst, and brought us your favor of the 14th Feby last, which in take the earliest opportunity of answering. We shall take great pleasure in laying your esteemed communication before the Society at our next meeting, and in making such arrangements as will ensure as far as possible the fulfilling of your requests. We have a great variety of cactuses, some of which bear beautifully scented flowers of scarlet, purple, yellow, and white; the cones vary in size from an apple to over 60 inches in circumference, and  bear a fruit which much resembles the flavor of the mellow gooseberry. We have also in the southern portion of our ter- ritory several varieties of the Agave or Soap Plant.  The almost inaccessible mountains are covered with many varieties of Pines, Balsams, Firs andc; among others we have the Pinyon Pine, which exudes a gum universally used by the natives, and now by many whites, for its healing properties. The Pinyon Pine is a dwarf tree, its foliage measured through horizontally generally exceeding in diameter the height of the tree; in its early growth it takes the shape of a haycock, and eventually that of an expanded umbrella; it seldom exceeds 20 feet in height, and the berry or nut being nutritious is gathered by the natives for sustenance, the last resembling that of the filbert. We have also the Red and white Cedar in immense quantities. Our Mountain Maple differs from all the varieties with which we are acquainted; it is a very hard grained wood, and seldom exceeds a foot in diameter. But the greatest curiosity of its kind is the Deseret Mountain Mahogany; it is the heaviest, hardest, and finest of any wood we have seen, being very close grained, and capable of a very fine polish; the colors are intermixed throughout from a dark brown to nearly white; it is a scarce tree, being found in but few localities. The Box Elder is a beautifully grained wood, much resembling the Bird's eye Maple, and is used for secretaries, Tables andc; this tree is found more or less throughout the Territory, but in the greatest quantity about 70 miles north of this city, giving the name to Box Elder County. Although we are writing on "Royal Oak day", we cannot boast much of our oaks in this territory; there are but few, and then mostly of a scrabby stunted growth.

The white settlers form pleasure parties, and go into the cañons to spend a few days during the season in gathering service berries, which they dry and lay up for winter use. If properly dried the fruit preserves its qualities throughout the year. We have also two varieties of a very prickly shrub, bearing a small acid berry, some red and some yellow; this we call the Buffalo berry, and it makes a good wine. The shrub grows to the height of about 8 feet.  You may not be aware that the 22nd of July 1847 was the first day that the van of the pioneers of civilization entered these valleys, about 130 in number, and among whom were your correspondents; that on the 23rd the first plow was put into the ground to tear up the virgin soil; and therefore you will have to make allowances for our imperfect knowledge of all the varieties of flowers, fruits, and shrubs. On account of the scarcity of food in 1848, the people made use of a root called the Sego, or "Calochortus Lateus"; this is a bulbous root from the size of a pea to that of the walnut, and grows in immense quantities; the flower much resembles a delicate tulip. There is another description of the Sego which is a deadly poison.  There is also an abundance of the Phaca Mollissima in this territory—a very neat flower; and many pretty flowers and grasses peculiar to this mountainous country, the scientific names of which we are unable to give at this time. We shall feel gratified in sending you the various specimens, and feel under many obligations for your kind offer to name many of them, and to form a floral list for Deseret; and we are aware from the delightful opportunities you have in the Royal Gardens, that you can confer on us many lasting favors, which will be appreciated not only by us a people but by our posterity.

In some instances with good management we have raised 75 Bushels to the acre; the general yield however is from 20 to 40 bushels according to the nature of the soil; and we have harvested three crops in one year from a single sowing. We have many varieties of the Indian corn—the yellow, white, sweet andc andc—also several kinds of Oats and Barley. We find the climate to be very excellent for the raising of potatoes, of which the blue Meshannick is the favorite; the other kinds are the Pink Eye, Large Blue, Deseret White andc andc. Our potatoes are very prolific, averaging nearly 500 bushels to the acre, and would remind Ireland some 14 years ago, before the disease appeared. From the limited time we have been in this country, it cannot reasonably be expected that we have the best collection of Fruit trees; but considering that we are living nearly a thousand miles from any other point of civilization, and that all have been raised from the seeds, we believe we can challenge competition for seedling peaches with any portion of the globe. Last season were produced many samples—some from trees only three years old from the seed—which measured over eight inches in circumference, and which were considered by competent judges as delicious as any grown in the United States; and by the great desire manifested by many individuals for the cultivation of fruit, we anticipate a continued improvement in size and flavor. We have many seedling apples that compare favorably with those of other countries, and by continued perseverance we have succeeded in obtaining a few grafts from the United States, which will enable us to improve upon our present varieties. There are but a few Apricots and Quinces in the country, and the Quinces are blooming this season for the first time. The climate appears particularly adapted for the raising of Grapes in great perfection; a few varieties that have been cultivated in Governor Young's garden present quite a luscious ap- pearance, the prospects this season being very good. We are happy to report that we have a strawberry, the seed of which we are credibly informed came from the ENDENTRY Fires, Destructive, during 1855 55 Fires in February 80 Firesin September 1855 49 Fires in the woods in New York 357 Fires, Large 109 Fish, Artificial breeding of 355 Fish Epidemic 395 Fish in the Artesian Creeks 38 Fish, the blue 174 Flax, Its culture and manufacture157 Fleas, New mode of killing 174 Flight, High 110                              Flower roots, Preserving tender 160 Flower roots, The resurrection 312 Flowers, To crystallize 62 Focus 170 Fodder, Calculations in regard to 376 Folly 158 Food, Economy of Vegetable 88 Food, prices of 87 Fool and lawyer 115 Fools, Seven 217 Foolscap paper 67 Forests, Buried 309 Fortune, Disparity of 163 Fossil remains 357 Fountains at the Crystal Palace 272 France 271 France, The inundations in 171 France,  The inundations 208 Franklin, Sir John's, Expedition 29 Free Country 89 French woman at home, A 101 Fruit, Forbidden 358 Fruit growing, 'Terra culture' as applied to 359 ENDENTRY Royal Gardens, Kew, and which promises to be a very fruitful bearer; the cal- culation is to bring this into almost exclusive cultivation.  When all things are taken into consideration, this city being only about 8 years old, and standing in a previously unknown, or rather untried climate, and being upwards of 4,000 feet above the level of the sea, surrounded by snow capped mountains, which tower 6,600 feet above the valley, and by arid, sandy deserts, we consider we have made great advancement in the cul- tivation of fruits, having raised nearly all from seeds.  Your generosity in kindly forwarding seeds or plants will be one of the greatest blessings you can confer upon us as a people, tens of thousands of whom were born on the British Isles, and retain a lively recollection of their native land. The seeds of strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries and currants, cuttings of grapes and roses, or any thing your judgment may dictate, would be highly prized here; and we beg leave to assure you that whatever you may be pleased to send to our address will be distributed in such a manner as that produce the greatest good to the greatest number. Should you be so kind as to take the trouble to have seeds and cuttings properly put up for us, we take the liberty of referring you to Prof r. James A. Little at the same address; they will not only carefully see to the receipt and delivery of such boxes and parcels as you may commit to their care, but will cheerfully respond to any queries and suggestions you may wish to make them.  We have thus written our first letter to you, briefly touching a few subjects in order that you may know our situation and wishes, and we shall promptly reciprocate your favors from time to time, and forward such seeds and specimens as you may wish as opportunity may present. We shall be grateful to you for such suggestions and instructions as you may in your leisure moments be pleased to give upon the subject of Horticulture and Botany.

As to Utah in some measure has already been told He leaves his wife and children at home and starts for Utah as a United States Judge to Judge the people and set them an Example for Morals. But He having been informed by some former officials that Utah was a hard place for Men of Leasure He picks him up a Miss in due time before He leaves St. Louis and He  brings that Miss with him and keeps her with him in all his as an assitent in all of his Official Labours in Utah and that to under the Honorable title of Mrs Drummand. But when Mrs City who is a sister of the  Real Mrs. Drummond called to pay her sister a visit She beheld a woman which she had never before seen and had to turn away in Disgust from one who may come to regulate the mind of Utah. And after clearing up trying to put the Capitol of the Territory under Marshall Law and having men carried a hundred miles in Juries  and brought before his honour for utering the treasonable opinions that Neither the Constitution and nor laws of the United States Required a United States Judge to have a Miss sit with him upon the Judgement Seat in order to make his acts legal, which cause he persued as many can testify and after going to  Calaforinia and publishing his charge to the Jury of law fully which He ner Delivered to them. He then Returning to the United States and writes his Resignation and tells the awful tails Murder and crimes of which Governer Young and the mormons were guilty, which has set all  the world in a foam but while Doing this He should have waited a little Longer before He went so near his Real wife as to cause her to go to pay him a visit and while seaking an interview with him He hastens to her her Home and steals some of the children and carried them off before she Returned so the Michigan paper paper published in his Neighborhood rep and off course they would not say anything about him but what was true ENDENTRY Emigrants for Utah 160 Emigrants for Utah 176 Emphasis 208 ^Energy 263^ California, Quickest passage between 88 England, How Yankees are taxed in 61 England, Ministers to 131 English Dinner Party 230 Enigma 47 Enigma 56 Enigma 64 Enigma 85 Enigma for Utah 280 Enigma, Geographical 263 Epigrams 115 Epilpsy, A cure for 110 Epistle, Fourteenth General 313 Erie Riots, Renewed 136 Error, A curious 187 Eusclent Roots, Cultivation of 55 Espionage in Loo Choo 10 Europe 61 Evergreens, Transplanting 312 Everything, A place for 168 Everything, Don't tell 397 ^Example, A good ^165^ 165^ Exercise 163 Exercise in open air 294 Expansion of Rock by the sun 88 Expenses, Cutting down 110 Expeiments with Cast Iron 248 Explanation, An 7 Explosion, One hundred and ten persons killed by an 272 Extravagance, The nation's 295 Extravagance, The nation's 168 ENDENTRY this is the man that writes to swallow up Utah and build a gallows to Hang the Governr and all his true friends upon But by way of conditions concerning him I would ask ^how^ what will the Hon Judge disperse of his two Mrs Drummonds Real living wives immorals as He is inspired with such Holy Honor against the mormons for Having more than one wife Or is that ^become^ admissible in the Christian world in this last age of civilization and Refinement with all men inasmuch as they are not mormons. We would like to be informed upon this point as we have been so long from the civilized world that we may be  ignorant upon some of the points of improvement  This is one singular characteristic with all men who eithr go out of Utah or go through it who are Enemies to this people and that is they just barly escape with ther lives yes they do Really escape with their lives and so many of them of ^them^ to, this is singular whn we consider that the mormons are such a Desperate Blod thirsty people as our Enemies would fain make world beleve but would there characters report this and feel this way if they did not really Believe that if Justice had ben done then they never would have left utah with ther lives I think not. But really has they not any body ben killed in Utah. If there has not ^been^, I think the people are sadly to blame for since the opening of the Gold milnes of Calafornia the whole country from Calafornia to Oregon has been so rifled with Murderers and Robers and thievs that the good Christian people of Calafornia have found it necssary to shout and find there scores and Hundreds without Judge or Jury acording to Law and no one has called them in question for it as told the Govenor resopnsible for it, and it would be strange if ther was not any one in Utah that should get killed without Judge or Jury but then I will acknowledge ther is a great Diffence for the people in Utah are mostly mormon and they have a mormon Governor and the Christins would of come throh that a Mormon Governor be held Responsible for the death of any man and evry crime committed in his territory while any man would at once be comitted fo and that Justly to ownly ben for the Insane Hospital who should make any such ENDENTRY Editorial.

If we are overtaken in a fault and do any thing wrong  in Utah we confess our sins and learn to forsake them  and thank our ^governor or any other friend^ frends for telling us our faults, Realizes that  the Rebukes of a frend are better and far more profitabe than the  kisses of an Enemy, but in the chrstian world the people  labor Diligently to hide ther faults, and if the Governor  of Connecticut was to tell the  people ther faults and show them ther sins they would consider himself ^themselves^ very fortunate ^to^ escape withot being puled down or having ther throat cut. The Question is often asked what is going to be done with Utah and what will the people of Utah do.  Now this Depends entirely upon circustances The inhabitants of Utah know well  as a people that they have broaken No law either Human  or Divine the Laws and Constitution of the United States  garentee unto us all that we have Either Realized or asked for  and if the Goernment of the United States persues a lawful and  Legal cause towards us ther will never be any Difficulty  betwen Utah and the General Government. and it is certainly Hard to believe that the Goverment will has arrived at that state of  Decline or Deacay that she would be willing to Risk the  Result and future consequences of steping out side of the  Constitution and opening a war of Pesecuton and extermation  against any state or territory because of ther Religious faith or practice as long as that faith or practice does not come  in contak with the constitutn or Laws of the United States  for in that case they might begin to withhold the sympathies from Utah and prepare to weep for thousads and the childen for should they attempt to undermine the constition that Great and Glorious Legacy Given by God throgh our Fathers unto the American people for the sake of Gratifying the envy of the Rable for a little Mormon Blod ENDENTRY Civility is a fortune 259 Civilization taking root in the Desert 32  Claim, The way to get a 142  Clergy, The secular  406  Climates, Different 309  Clocks, Electrical 255  Cloth, To make new, sew-easily 203  Coal gas, How it is made 109  Coal mines, The new 25  Coat collars, To clean 359  Cold weather in March 77  ^Cold, How to Break up a 131^ ^Colic in Horses 358^  Collodion 267 Comet, Expected 157 ^Commandment, The Eleventh 346^  Committee Soiree 208  ^Communing with ones self 312^  Companies yet on the plains 293  Conference, General; April 6, 1856 40  Conference, Semi Annual; Oct 6, 1856 256  Conference, Provo Apl. 26-7 1856 84 Conference, Special at San Bernardino Mch 15, 1856 134  ^Conference, General at San Bernardino Oct 11, 1856 341^ Conference, Australasian Sept 30, 1855 148  Conference, Sandwich Islands April 6, 1856 172  Conference, Sandwich Islands Oct 6, 1856 366  Conference at Kaysville Sept 13, 1856 228  Conference Lake City  Aug 30, 1856 228  Conference Lake City Oct 18, 1856 276 Conference, Bountiful Aug 17, 1856 228  Conference Bountiful Sept 27-9, 1856 245 ^Conference Bountiful Nov 1, 1856 292^  Conference, Centerville Sept 25, 1856 248  Conference Spanish Fork Sept 27-9, 1856 258  Conference Cedar City   June 7-8, 1856 258  Conference Jordan Mill Branch  Oct 15-16, 1856 266  Conference Pleasant Grove   Oct 25, 1856 284  ^Conferences, Basis of the Peace 77^ Confidence 371  Conflagration, A 259 Conflagration, Another 259 ENDENTRY it would not Require a prophet to foresee that the mighty fabric  Fabric ^of American Government^ would soon fall and bury them all in its ^the nation in its^ Ruines  In case that an army of Editors, prints and those who cry so   loud against Utah could not possibly waidt for the  movements of Government to gratify ther thirst for Blood but should gather together and come against Utah and Request us  very politely to hold still (as they have done in several writings) before) while they cut our throats, Marter our prophets, violate Ravish our women and kick out the favor of our children in that case it is my spiritual, temporal, cordial and  Legal opinion, that in this last age of improvement that united of crushing them ^in^ ther polite request ^we curches should take a look at the gang^ and holding still while they  ^It is my opinion that we should not hold still while our enemies^  perform the deed as we did have done several times before  under the sacred promise of Governor and Judges that it would not but is to have our throats cut.

The Lord Raised up Joseph Smith to bring forth  his work He was a true prophet of God and both the Righteous and  wicked will find it so when they come to Judgment. He brought forth  the Book of Mormon which is a true Record.  The Lord Raised  him up to bring forth the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel unto this Generation to save the honest and meek of the Earth and the leave the wicked without excuse in the day of Gods Judgment, and prepare the  way for the Coming of the Son of man. He was a good and Elect man  and laid the foundation of a great work which Neither men nor Devils can overthrow.

They are in relation to the blessing of little children.  1st. Is it actually necessary for the Saints to take their Children to the fast meetings to have them named and blessed?  2nd. Is it not the fathers right ENDENTRY and privilege to bless his own offspring. and in case he does not take them to fast meeting to have them blessed again will they be cut short of any blessings in the great eternity before us?  None of my children have been blessed in fast meeting, their grandfather (the late Bp. E. D. Woolley,) blessed all that were born prior to his death, and those born since I have blessed. I keep a family record, and give the branch clerk a copy of the Same. I also babtize my children on the day that they are eight years old. Am I right on these  matters.
