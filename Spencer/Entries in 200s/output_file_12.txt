 and professing to be a most liberal free thinker,spoke to the people very freely about one hour onhis particular views, his manner and style wasvery unassuming, and affable; he was listenedto with great attention; and thoes present remarkedthat he was one of the greatest reasoners they everheard. The free thinker was followed by JohnS. Carter, who delivered a very elegant dis-course on practical piety. Elder Joseph Youngspoke on the principles of free salvation, follow-ed by Elder Brigham Young who set forthbaptism as nessary for salvation. After afew moments resess, at two oclock P.M. thetrumpet again sounded, and a largecongregation from jacksonvill and surroundingcountry appeared again in the grove, manyof whom expressed a desire to hear that metho-dist man again. So I called Br. JosephYoung into my tent, and told him topreach an animated sermon on free grace, andtold him he should have the spirit. I thenwent to Amasa Lyman, and said to him,"I understand Mr. Lyman that you ar aPrespetarian." "Yes" said he "I believe in thatdoctrin" 'Well' said I, "I wish you whouldmake a few remarks to the people on that subject,after Mr. Young has done. I also sent for elder 
 Orson Pratt, and said to him, When thesebrotherin get through speaking to the peopleI wish you to make a few remarks reasoningon the importance of a union of all the differantsects, and denominations. These brotherincomplied with my request, and the cong-gregation was also eddefied by elder OrsonHyde on baptism for the remission of sins,by Hiram Stratton exhorting the people toobey the gospel, and Eleazar Miller gave apowerful exortation. After the services of theday were closed, many strangers maderemarks on the preaching they had heard,they though[t] Joseph Young was a methodistand were anxious he should stay in thatcountry and preach. They supposed BrighamYoung was a close communion baptist,Orson Hyde a camblite, or reformed baptist,Lyman E johnson a presbytarian, AmasaLyman Lyman a presbytarian, Orson Pratta universalest and inquired very carefullyif we all belonged to one denomination, thebrotherin replied some of us were meathodists,some baptists, some campbelites, resirectionests ect,.At the close of the meeting the sacrement wasadministered and professing christians ofevery denomination were invited to pertake, 
 Dr. Willams came down from Jacksonville withthe people, attended meeting and returned withthem. In the evening after supper, he left Jacksonvilleand returned to camp, and reported that thepeople universally (who had visited the camp)expressed the highest satisfaction, with the treatmentand entertainment, and the good order thatprevailed in our midst, that one gentlemen saidhe had vissited the camp, and presumed hehad questioned about one hundred of themen, and had receieved polite answers to allof his questions, but could not ascertain whothey were, where they were gowing, or whatwere their business, and I believe them a fineset of fellows or a pack of damn knaves andI cannot tell for my life which. Anotherintellagent gentlemen remarked that he didnot believe there was a collage in the UnitedStates, that could turn out such an aloquentset of preachers, as he had heard that dayin the camp. Dr. Willams said he had heardhundred of such like remarks at Jacksonville,and the most perfect good humor prevailedthroughout the town.June 2, 1834 ~ MondayMonday June 2nd,We passed through Jacksonville, they undertookto count us, and I heard one man say, 
 (who stood in the door of a cabnit shop) thathe had counted a little rising of five hundredmen, and he could not tell how many therewere. This thing was attempted many timesin villages and towns, as we passed through,and the people were never able to ascertain ournumber. We traveled twenty four miles, crossedthe Illioniois river at Phillips ferry and encampedon the west bank. This morning we sent, brotherLuke Johnson to ascertain the feelings of thepeople, and report to us, the country we passedthrough was one of great scarsety though littlesettled. Levi Hancock repeats what ^Joseph^ said, in our tent, "I wantyou to remember what I say to you, theLord is gowing to give us dry weather nowtill we get through, he has given us rain, thatwe might have water on the prairie, you willsee the mercy of God in our favor all the way throughJune 3, 1834 ~ TuesdayTuesday the 3rd.Dureing our travels we visited sevral of the moundswhich had been thrown up by the ancientinhabidants of this country, and this morningI went up on a high mound near the riveraccompanied by many of the brotherin. Fromthis mound we could over-look the tops of thetrees, and view the prairie on eather side of the 
 river, as far as our vision could extend, and thescenery was truly delightful. On the tops of themounds were stones which personated theapperance of three altars, one above the other, accord-ing to the ancient order, and the remains of boneswere shown over the surface of the ground.Wilford Woodruff says, "this mound was con-sidered three hundred feet above the Illinoisriver, we had a shovel and a hoe with us,and while we were desending the mound, theProphet Joseph stopped suddenly and pointedto the ground and said. "Brotherin dig in there."And when we had dug one foot we uncovered theskeleton of a man, which was entire, and in agood state of perservation, and between his ribsin the back bone was found the stone pointof a lamanitish arrow, whiched produced hisdeath. Milton Homes took the arrow out ofthe back bone, also one of the thigh bones whichhad been broken, and took it to camp, andput it into my wagon; and at noon whileresting in camp, the Prophet Joseph, whilelying in his wagon, was rap[p]ed in vision,and the history of this man whoes body wediscovered, was shown unto him. His namewas Zelph he was a white lamanite, a largethick set man, and a man of God. The 
 curse had been taken from him because of hisrighteousness. He was a warrior, and a chieftonHe fought under the prophet Onondagus, whoheld domion from the east to the west sea includ-ing the Rocky-mountains. Zelph had his thighbone broken from the sling of a stone, whilein battle, many years before his death. Hewas killed in battle by the arrow found inhis back bone, dureing a great strugglewith the Lamenites, and I Wilford Woodruff,carried the thigh bone to Clay County andburried it in that country, I intended tohave burried it in Jackson County, thinkingthat some prophet might have prophisied to himthat the members of Zions camp whould havetaken his bones with them to Zion and burriedthem their, when they went up to redeem Zion;But not having the privlage of gowing toJackson County, I buried it in Clay County.The same day that we left this mound; atnoon while resting our teams and ourselves,Brother Joseph called the camp togather, and aftergiving them instructions, standing on a wagonwheel, he prophesied unto the camp, and saidthe Lord had proved to him, that there whouldbe a scourage visit the camp in consiquinceof the fractious, and unruly spirit that 
 appeared among them, and they whould dielike sheep with the rot; still if they whould repent,and humble themselves before the Lord, thescourage in a great measure might be lessened,but as the Lord lived this camp will suffer bygiving away to such unruly temper. Thisspeach affected every soul in camp, I do notthink there was a dry eye in camp. Joseph theProphet says, I had a conversation with Col.Ross, (a wealthy gentleman in the neighborhood)who gave us a flattering account of the country,and wished to employ one hundred men forwhich he proposed to make ready payment. Hewanted brick makers, builders ect etc. Our commisarypurchased twenty five gallons of honey at twentyfive cents a gallon, and a dozzen Missouricured hams, which proved to have been a littleimproved on the out side; there not being enoughto supply one for every company; my companyagreed to do without; our supper consisted ofmush and honey, as we had been unableto procure flour on account of the scarcity ofmills, after the fetagues of the day, it hardlysatisfied our hunger, but when we had quitefinished, some six of the hams were brought toour tent door, and thrown down in angersaying, "we dont eat stinking meat." I called 
 on brother Zebeda Colton, (our cook) and toldhim to be quick and fry some ham, asI had not had my hunger fairly appeasedfor forty eight hours; he amediately commencedcooking the ham, and for once my companyfeasted to their full satisfaction. We had justretired to rest, when the picket guard announced,Luke Johnson. He came into our tent, andmade his report. He had visited a numberof influential men, among the rest abaptist minister, who expressed great anxietythat our company should be stopped, andwent to the Magistrate to inquire if there wasnot some law or pretense for stopping us. He(the priest) said to the Magistiate, that the com-pany marched, and had guns like an army,they pitched their tents by the side of the road; theyset out guards, and let no body pass into theircamp at night, and they are Mormons; andI believe they are gowing to kill the people up inJackson County, Missouri, and retake theirlands. The Magistrate replied, "If you weretraveling, and did not want to put up atpublic houses, or there was none in that country,whould you not camp by the roadside in a tent;and if you were afraid that your horses, or propertywhould be stolen in a strange country; whould 
 you not watch, and keep guard." "Why yes," saidthe priest, "but these are Mormons." "Well I canthear but they mind their own business, and ifyou, and this stranger (meaning Luke Johnson)will mind your own business, every thingwill be right." This baptist priest, treated brotherLuke Johnson with great politeness, gave himhis dinner; his wife washed his stockings, gavehim letters of interduction to men in JacksonCounty, delivered to his charge some letters thathe had received from Jackson County, which brotherLuke brought into camp; he also stated that he hadseen a man that morning, who informedhim that four hundred men were in readiness,on the Missouri side, at ten hours notice to use upall the camp, and he was on his way to give themnotice a little before midnight. We heard sevralguns fired, to the west of us, which appeared to beanswered by one directly east. There was no settle-ment west of us nearer the state of Missouri, thisappearing so much like a signal, in additionto the many threats of our being attacted on cross-ing the Mississippi, I considered sufficant causeof alarm to put out a double picket guard, andplace the camp in a state of defence, so that everyman might be ready at a moments notice; ithowever proved to be a false alarm. 
 June 4, 1834 ~ WednesdayWednesday the 4th,We crossed the large island which was about fivemiles wide and encamped on the bank of theMississippi. We were short of provisions, havinglittle else but Indian meal; and no wateraxcept the river, which we carried across the Mississippi.Many of the company had the dispasition toscatter in the woods for hunting, but I advisedthem to the contrary. Some of the brotherin wenton to the sand bar, and got a quantity of turtleseggs as they supposed, I told them they weresnake eggs, and they must not eat them, butsome of the brotherin thought they knew more thanI did about it, and still presisted in declairing thatthey were turtles eggs, I said they were snakes eggs,"eat snakes eggs will you, the man that eats themwill be sorry for it; you will be sick." Notwithstand-ing all I said sevral brotherin did eat them andwere sick all the day afterJune 5, 1834 ~ ThursdayThursday the 5th.We crossed the Mississippi river, which was a tediousjob, having but one small flat boat, and the riverbeing nearly one and a half miles wide; whilesome were ferrying, others were engaged in hunting,fishing &c. As we arrived we encamped on the bankwithin the limits of Missouri. While at this place,Sylvester Smith rebelled against the order of the 
 company, and gave vent to his feelings againstmyself in particular in consequence growlingat him while he was marching the company upto the camp, he being the last that came overthe river. The next morning I told them thatI whould desend to the spirit that was manifestedby some of the brotherin to let them see the folly oftheir wickedness. I rose up and commenced speakingby saying, "If any man insults me or abuses meI will stand in my own defence, at the expenseof my life, and if a dog growls at me I will lethim know that I am his master." At this momentSylvester Smith who had just returned from here hehad just turned out his horses to feed, came upand hearing me mak the remarks said, "If, thatdog bites me I will kill him." I turned to Sylvesterand said, "If you kill that dog I'll whip you." Andwent on to show the brotherin how wicked and un-christianlike such conduct appeared before theeyes of truth and justice. (The elders in Clay Countywrote Governer Dunklin as follows) (if nessary toinsert in this history, this letter will be found in BookA. No. 2 page 320.) from the Missouri Enquirer page322 to 324)June 6, 1834 ~ FridayJune the 6th,We resumed our journey, and at night encampedin a yard in a maple grove, near the creek. The 
 men who had previously followed, passed us sevraltimes during the day, and were in search of usthis evening, the guards heard them say; ["]They haveturned aside dam 'em, we cant find 'em." Elders SethJohnson and A. M. Babbett who had been sent toBowling Green branch to gather recruits returnedto the camp on the morning of the 7th, with asmall company two wagons and sevral spare horsesJune 7, 1834 ~ SaturdaySaturday the 7th,One of the camp walked on ahead to procure somemilk; A number of men armed with guns methim and said, "Here is one damed mormon alonelets kill him," but at the same instant discovered anumber of others just coming over the hill, when theyimmediately rode off in great haste. In the eveningencamped in a grove near a spring in MonroeCounty where was a branch of the church known asthe Salt River church, and frequently called theAkered settlement. Here we remained sevral days,washing our clothes, and preparing to resume ourjourney. Levi Hancock says, "while here I workedon guns, I also made a flag staff and put onit a white flag tipped with red and put iton my wagon, and put on it an eagle, andprinted on it in large letters Peace; and as we wentthrough the settlements, many whould come, andlook at my flag and say peace, and walk off. 
 One night we camped in the middle of a prairiewithout water; one man took a spade and said,["]Who knows but I can find water here." and duga small hole, which soon filled with good water;when the brotherin saw this, they said it was asmuch a miracle as for Moses to bring water outof the rockJune 8, 1834 ~ SundaySunday the 8th.We were joined by my brother Hiram Smithand Lyman Wight with another company, whostarted from Pontiac, Michigan Ter. May the 5th,the same day that we started from Kirtland, theyhaving passed through Ann Arber, Jacksonburg,Spring Arbor, Constantine, Elkhart, crossed theIllinois river one mile below Attawa, PleasantGrove, Pekin, Quincy, and Polmepa. Elijah Fordhamwas their Historian, Lymon Wight Steward,Hiram Smith, and Samual Bent Moderator. Wehad agreed to meet at this point, and the firstthat arrived was to wait for the other, and it wasa happy meeting. Soon after the arrival of brotherHiram and his company, I dispatched brotherLuke Johnson and Almon W. Babbet withmessages to the brotherin in Clay County, fearingthat the letter which I sent from Springfield hadmiscarried. James Alberd Sen. and ten others ofthis branch of the Church joined our camp which 
 now numbered two hundred and five men, allarmed and equiped as the law directs; it wasdelightful to see the companies, for they were allyoung men, except one company whom we calledthe Silver Grays, and who ate at my table. Wewere all in good spirits, and were taught thesworde exercise by brother Willam Cherry (who was anative of Ireland) an expert drill master, who hadbeen in the British dragoon service for upwords of twentyyears, and deservs much credit for his unweariedexertions ^in^ importing all he knew to the brotherin.This was our first attempt at learning the swordeexercise; brother Hiram Stratton and Nelson Tubbsprocured a shop of Myers Mabley, and reparedevery firelock that was out of order in the camp,and David Elliot shod our horses. Here brotherJames Forster was taken sick, I proposed to himto remain behind he said, "Brother Joseph let mego with you if I die on the road." I told himin the name of the Lord if that was his faith, togo on his bed in the wagon and he whouldget better every day untill he recovered, which wasliterally fulfilled. We reorganized the camp, I wasacknowledged the Commander-in-chief, LymanWight General; I chose twenty men for my life guardconsisting of two companies, (my brother Hiramwas chosen captain of the first ten, and Roger Orton 
 captain of the second, and Gorge A. Smith myarmor bearer, F. G. Willams quarter master,Z. Snow commissary, Nathan Tanner assistant,Sylvester Smith adjutant, the remainder of thecamp was organized into companies of ten.While at Salt River General Wight marsheled thecamp on the prairie and inspected our fire locksordered the discharge of the same at targets by plat-toons, drilled us half a day, and about this time I dispatched Elders Orson Hyde and ParleyP. Pratt to Jefferson City with a message toGoverner Dunken, to ascertain if he was ready tofulfill the proposition which he had previouslymade to the brotherin to reinstate them on theirlands in Jackson County, and leave them thereto defend themselves. June 4th Governer Dunkenwrote to W. W. Phelps and others, as follows; Mailedat City of Jefferson 9th June 1835 [1834]. Herewith youhave a second order for the delivery of your arms nowin the possession of the Milita of Jackson County.Col. Lucus has resigned his command he informsme; If Lut. Col. Pitcher should be arrested beforeyou receive this, you will please hold up the orderuntill I am informed who may be appointedto the command of the regiment,Respectfully,Danial Dunken, 
 The foregoing letter endorced the following orderCity of Jefferson June 4th 1834,Thomas Pitcher, Lut. Col. Commandant,of the 33rd Regiment,Sir,On the 2ndday of last May I showed an order to Col.Lucas to deliver the fifty two guns and onepistol, which you received from the Mormons onthe 5th day of November last, and reported to himon the 3rd day of the succeeding December to W.W. Felps, E. Patridge, John Corrill, John Whitmer,and A. L. Gilbert on their order; On the 24 ultimoCol. Lucus wrote and informed me that he hadresigned his Commission, and left the Countyof Jackson. You as Commandant of said regi-ment are therefore commanded to collect thesaid arms if they are not already in your posession,and deliver them to the aforesaid gentlemen, ontheir order.Respectfully,Danial Dunken,Commander in Chief,The following day Judge Ryland wrote the follo-ing,Richmond 10th June 1834,Sir, Deeply impressed with a desire 
 to do all in my power to settle or allay thedifficulties between the Mormons and the Citizensof Jackson County. I have concluded that itmight have some tendency to affectuate thisobject by having the Mormons called togatherat Liberty next Monday, and there explain tothem my notions and views of their presentsituation, and of the circumstances attendant,I therefore request you to use all your influencewith your brotherin to get them to meet me onnext Monday in Liberty. I much fear anddread the consequences that are yet to ensue unlessI should succeed in my wishes to restore peace.It is the duty of all good men to use all properand laudible means to establish peace. I expect adeputation of some of the most respectable citizensof Jackson County will meet me on Monday nextat Libert, I call upon you in the name of hu-manity therefore to leave no effects untried tocollect your brotherin at Liberty as requested.Should my efforts to make peace fail of suc-cess there can at least be no wrong Sir inthe attempt, and I [s]hall enjoy the concelationof having done my duty as a man aswell as a christian. I hope Sir, you willduly appricate the motive which promptsme to address this letter to you, and will 
 aid me with all your influence with yourbrotherin in the prosecution of an object so muchto be desired by all good men, and citizens,Yours very respectfully,John F. Ryland.June 12, 1834 ~ ThursdayJune 12th,We left Salt River and traveled about fifteenmiles. The inhabitants manifested a greatrespect for us, and many of them accompaniedus some distance on our journey. I instructedthe camp in the morning, that if a gunwas fired it whould be considered an alarm,but in the course of the day while I wasa little ahead, I shot a squirel for brotherFoster, when several of the brotherin came runningup to see what was the matter. I told them brotherFoster was sick. I want you should pray for him.June 13, 1834 ~ FridayFriday 13th,Elder Kimball's horses through the negligance ofthe guard got loose and went back ten mileswith others; he persued them and brought themback to camp. F. G. Willam and RogerOrton received a very severe chastisement forneglect of orders in not taking care of the teamswhen in charge of the guards. The reproofgiven to Roger Orten was more particularlyfor suffering Elder Kimball to go back after the 
 horses, as he was one of my life guards, and itbelonged to Roger to see that the teams wereattended to, but as the team was Kimball's, andhe had taken the care of it all through, Ortonsstill threw the care on him. The Silver grey companynumbering fourteen were attached to my messmaking it twenty eight in numbers.June 14, 1834 ~ SaturdaySaturday 14Brother Joseph Hancock and another of the brotherinwe're chased a considerable po[r]tion of the day byfour suspicious fellows on horsback armed withguns, whom they attracted by traveling in thebrush and thickets where horsmen could notride; it was late when they returned to camp.At night we encamped in an unsafe and un-plesant situation, in a small ravine theonly place we could get water for some miles.The country was a wild uninhabited region.In answer to the Judge the Elders wroteHon. J. F. Rayland, Near Liberty, 14 June 1835^4^Dear Sir,Your communicationof the 9th I'nst, from Richmond, was dulyreceived, and at a public meeting of our societythis day its contents made known, our brotherinunanimously rendered their thanks for the 
 laudible disposition manifested on your partto effect peace between our society and the inhabitantsof Jackson County, and as many as can con-veniently will be present on Monday next. Entertainingsome fears that your honor in his zeal for peacemight unwarily recommend a sale of our landsin Jackson County we have thought it expedientto give reasonable notice that no such propositioncould reasonable be consented to by our Societywe have not heard that it was the intention ofyour honor to urge any such measure, but ourenemies in Jackson County have long beentrying to effect this object. In a letter fromthe Governer he says "I have been requested toadvice the Mormons to sell out and moveaway but beliving that it could have no goodeffect, I have withheld my advice." We givethis quotation from the Governer's letter todisprove the statement made in the UpperMissouri Enquirer of last Wednsday, andconclude by adding that home is home, andwe want possession of our homes from whichwe have been wickedly expelled, and thoesrights which belonge to us, as natural free-borncitizens of the United States.We are respectfully your friends and servant,A. S. Gilbert (Sect) John Corrill (Chair)Chairman 
 The foregowing was inclosed in the followingletter to their Lawyers,Gentlemen,Will you be so goodas to read the inclosed then seal and hand tothe Judge. We have given him an early hintfearing that he might be induced by the sol-icitation of our enemies to prepare a sale of ourlands, which you well know whould be likeselling our children into slavery, and urging ofsuch a measure whould avail nothing unless toproduce an excitement against us in this countryas requested last Thursday. We hope you willbe present on Monday.Your friends and servants,John Corrill, A. S. GilbertJune 15, 1834 ~ SundaySaturday [Sunday] 15th,Traveled twelve miles, on the way Orson Hydeand Parley P. Pratt returned to us from JeffersonCity, and reported that Governer Dunkinrefused to fulfill his promice to reinstate thebrotherin on their lands in Jackson Countyon the grounds of impracticability. We crossedthe Chariton River at its mouth and encampedon the west bank. Bishop Patridge came into thecamp from Clay County, we received muchinformation from him concerning the hostile 
 feeling and prejudice that exhisted againstus in Missouri in all quarters, but it gaveus great satisfaction to receive intellagence fromhim of the union and good feelings thatprevailed among the brotherin; as we were inperrils and threatened all the while we weremuched troubled to get provissions, and hadto live on corn meal principly, and was gladto get that. Here Dean Gould was baptizedby Lyman Wight.June 16, 1834 ~ MondayMonday 16th,Traveled too, ferried over, and encamped onthe bank of Grand River, the ferrymanintended charging seventeen dollars, thebrotherin said they whould not pay it,but whould sooner make a raft andferry themselves over, he then agreed to takethem over for twelve dollars which we accepted.This morning was exceedingly hot, no airstirring, and traveling in the thick woods, athunder shower coming on, the brotherin caughtall the water they could on the brims of theirhats, and not catching enough to satisfy theirthirst, they drank out of horsetracks. MartinHarris having boasted to the brotherin thathe could handle snakes with perfect safety,While fooling with a blue snake with his 
 bare feet, he received a bite on his left foot, itwas communicated to me, and I took accasionto reprove him, and exhorted the brotherin neverto trifle with the promises of God, I told themit was presumption for any one to provokea serpant to bite him, but if a man of God,was accidentaly bitten by a poisonous serpanthe might have faith or his brotherin mighthave faith for him so that the Lord whouldhear his prayer, and he might be healed, butwhen a man designedly provokes a serpant tobite him the principle is the same as when aman drinks deadly poison knowing it to besuch, in that case no man has claim onthe promises of God to be healed. The citizens ofClay County (to the number of eight hundredor a thousand among whom were the brotherin)assembled at the Court-house in Liberty agreeably to the request of Judge Rayland in hisletter of the 10th instant, where they met Judge Raynaldand a deputation from Jackson who presentedthe following propositions of the people of JacksonCounty to the Mormons,The undersigned Committee being fullyauthorized by the people of Jackson County,hereby propose to the Mormons that they will 
 buy all the lands that the said Mormonsown in the County of Jackson and alsoall the improvements which the said Mormonshad on any of the public lands in saidCounty of Jackson as they exhisted before thefirst disturbance between the people of Jacksonand the Mormons, and for such as they havemade since. They further more propose that thevaluation of said land and improvements shallbe ascertained by three disintrested inhabitants tobe chosen and agreed to by both parties. Theyfurther propose that should the parties disagreein the choice of arbitraters then ; ; ; ; is to choosethem. They further more propose that twelveof the Mormons shall go along with the arbi-trators to show them the land and improvementswhile valueing the same, and such others ofthe Mormons as the arbitrators shall want todo so to give them information, and the peopleof Jackson County garentee their entire safetywhile doeing so, they further propose thatwhen the arbitraters report the value of the landand improvements as afore said, the people ofJackson County will pay the valuation withone hundred percent added thereon, to theMormons within thirty days thereafter. They furtherpropose that the Mormons are not to make 
 any effort [e]verafter to settle either collectively orindividually within the limits of JacksonCounty. The Mormons are to enter into bondsto insure the conveyances of their lands in JacksonCounty according to the above terms when thepayment shall be made and the committeewill enter into a like bond with such securityas may be deemed sufficient for the paymentof the money according to the above prepositions.While the arbitrators are investigating anddeciding upon the matters preposed tothem, the Mormons are not to attempt toenter Jackson County or to settle there exceptsuch as are by the foregoing prepositionspermitted to go there. They further proposethat the people of Jackson County will sell alltheir lands and improvements on publiclands in Jackson County to the Mormonsthe valuation to be obtained in the samemanner the same percent in addition tobe paid, and the time the money is tobe paid is the same as the above set forthre◊◊◊◊◊eth in our proposition to buy. TheMormons to give good security for the paymentof the money, and the undersigned will togive security that the land willto the Mormons. They further propose that all 
 parties are to remain — — — — as they are tillthe payment is made at which time the peopleof Jackson County will give possession. Sign◊◊◊(Signed) Samual C. Owens, John Davis,Thomas Jeffress, Richard Frestoe, SmallwoodNoland, Thomas Hayton Sen., Robert Rickman,Thomas Campbell, Abraham Mc Clellon. Onpresentation of the foregowing Samual C Owensmade a flaming war speech, and Genl Doniphanreplied on the side of peace. The Revd Mr. Riley, abaptist, made a hot speech against the Mormonsand said the Mormons had lived long enough inClay County and they must either clear out, orbe cleared out. Turnham the Moderator of the Meetinganswered in a masterly manner saying, "Let us berepublicans, let us honor our Country and notdisgrace it like Jackson County, for Gods sakedont disfranchise or drive away the Mormons, theyare better citizens than many of the old inhabitants"General Doniphan exclaimed, "Thats a fact, and asthe Mormons have armed themselves if they dontfight they are cowards, I love to hear that theyhave brotherin comeing to their assistance, graterlove can no man show, than he who lays downhis life for his brotherin." At this critical instant,the cocking of pistols, the jingle of insterments of death,[blank] desperation, one motioned "adjourn" 
 another "go on", and in the midst of this awfulcrisis a person bawled into to doors "a man stabbed"the mass instantly rushed to the spot, in hopes,as some said that one damed Mormon had got killed, but as good luck whould have it, only oneMissourian had dirked another, (one Colbert ablacksmith had stabbed one Males, who hadpreviously whipped one Mormon nearly to deathand boasted of having whipped many more.) thewound was dangerous and as the Lord was thereit seemed as though the occurance was nessaryto brake up the meeting without further bloodshedand give the Saints a chance to consult whatwhould be most advisable in such a criticalinstant, and they amediately penned the followinganswer to the propositions from Jackson County,presented by Owens &c.,Gentlemen,Your propositions for anadjustment of the difficulties between the Citizensof Jackson County, and the Mormons is beforeus, and as explained in the Court House this day,we are not authorised to say to you that ourbrotherin will submit to your proposel, but weagree to spread general notice, and call a meetingof our people in all, the present week, and lay before 
 you an answer as soon as Saturday or Mondaynext. We can say for ourselves and in behalf ofour brotherin that peace is what we desire, and whatwe dispose to cultivate with all men, and to effectpeace we feel disposed to use all our influence asfar as it whould be required at our hands, asfree common citizens of the United States, andas fears have been expressed that we designed tocommence hostilities against the inhabitants ofJackson County, we have pledged ourselves tothem, and to the hospitable Citizens of Clay Countythat we will not, neither had designed as a peopleto commence hostilities against the afore saidCitizens of Jackson County, or any other people.Our answer shall be handed to Judge Turnhamthe Chairman of the Meeting even earlier thanthe time before stated if possiable.(Signed) W. W. Felps, A. S. Gilbert, Willam E. Lettin, John Coarill, Isaace Morley.NB. as we are informed that a large numberof our people are on their way removing to JacksonCounty, we agree to use our influence amediatelyto prevent said company from entering intoJackson County untill you shall receive ananswer to the proposition afore named.It may be thought at first view that themob committee made a fair proposition 
 to the Saints in offering to buy their lands atone hundred percent in thirty days and offeringtheir's on the same terms, but when it is understoodthat the mob held possession of a much larger quantityof land than the Saints and that they only offeredthirty days for the payment having previously rob[b]edthem of nearly every thing that they had, it whouldbe readily seen that they were only making a shamto cover their previous unlawful conduct, but thetempest of an immediate conflict seemed to be checkedand the Jackson Mob to the number of about fifteenwith Samual E. Owens and James Campbell,at their head started for Independance JacksonCounty to raise an army sufficient to meet mebefore I could get into Clay County. Campbellswore as he adjusted his pistols in his holsters, "TheEagles and Turkey buzzards shall eat my flesh if Ido not fire Joe Smith and his army so that their skin will not hold shucks before two days are passed.They went to the ferry and undertook to cross theMissouri River after dark and the Angel of Godsaw fit to sink the boat about the middle of theriver, and seven out of twelve that attempted to crosswere drowned. Thus suddenly and justly wentto their own place by water. Campbell was amongthe missing he floated down the river some four orfive miles, and lodged upon a pile of drift wood 
 where the eagles, buzzards, ravens, crows and animalsate his flesh from his bones, to fulfill his ownwords, and left him a horriable looking skeletonof God's vengeance which was discoveredabout three weeks after by one Mr. Purtle.Owens saved his life only after floatingfour miles down stream where he lod-ged upon an island, swam off toshore, walked about daylight througha field of settles, borrowed a mantlefrom a woman to hide his shameand slipped home rather shy of thevengeance of GodJune 17, 1834 ~ TuesdayTuesday 17th. At noon we crossed theWacondah; it being high we had to beferried over. We were informed here thata party of men were gathering togeth-er on the Missouri River with the in-tention of attacking us that night. Theprairie ahead of us was twenty-threemiles long without any timber or pal-atable wholesome water. Some of thebrethren wished to stop near the timberand were about making arrangementsto pitch their tents. We had but littleprovisions; I proposed to get some woodand water to carry with us and go on 
 the prairie 8 or 10 miles. My brother Hy-rum said he knew in the name ofthe Lord that it was best to go on tothe prairie, and as he was my elderbrother, I thought best to heed his coun-sel though some were murmuring in thecamp. We accordingly started. When Ly-man Wight crossed the river he disap-proved of our moving onto the prairie,upon which Sylvester Smith placed him-self in the road, turned back all thathe could by saying, "Are you followingyour General, or some other man"? andtwenty staid behind with Lyman Wight.We drove about 8 miles on the prairieand encamped out of sight of timber.The sun apparently went down androse again in the grass. Our companyhad filled a couple of empty pow-der kegs with water which tasted sobad we could not drink it, and allthe water we had was out of aslough filled with red living animals,and was putrid. About eleven o'clockLyman Wight arrived with the companythat had remained with him. Icalled them together and reproved themfor tarrying behind and not obeying 
 my counsel, and told Lyman Wight neverto do so again. He promised to standby me forever and never forsake meagain let the consequences be what itwould; but Sylvester Smith manifestedvery refractory feelings.June 18, 1834 ~ WednesdayWednesday 18th. As Hyrum Stratton andhis companions were taking up theirblankets this morning, they discoveredtwo prairie rattlesnakes quietly sleepingunder them which they carefully car-ried out of the camp. This day myhealth was so poor, I left the affairsof the camp to the management ofGen. Wight. Having no provisions, wetraveled seventeen miles before breakfast.I rode in Elder Kimball's wagon. Wecrossed a slough half a mile wide,through which most of the brethrenwere obliged to wade waist deep inmud and water. Gen. Lyman Wightwho had travelled from Kirtland with-out a stocking on his foot, carried Br.Joseph Young through on his back. Ourbreakfast consisted entirely of corn mealmush, or hasty pudding; we had notmeal enough in our company to makethe mush of the consistence of good starch. 
 After our 10 o'clock breakfast wepassed on to within one mile ofRichmond. We encamped in a verysmall prairie surrounded by a thicketof hazel brush. When I arrived wherethe camp had pitched their tentsand viewed our unsafe location con-sidering the danger of an attackfrom our enemies, I almost forgotmy sickness, went some distance inthe brush, bowed down and prayedmy heavenly father to suffer no evilto come upon us, but keep us safelythrough the night. I obtained anassurance that we should be safeuntil morning. Notwithstanding thefact that about 50 of the JacksonCounty mob crossed the Lemington Fer-ry that evening for the purpose ofjoining the Clay County mob and ofmaking an attack upon us, allwas quiet in the camp through thenight. While the brethren were mak-ing their bed in Capt. Brigham Young'stent, one of them discovered a verymusical rattle snake which they wereabout to kill. Capt. Young told themnot to hurt it, but to carry it out of 
 the tent when Br. Carpenter took itin his hands carried it beyond alldanger and left it to enjoy its liberty,telling it not to return.June 19, 1834 ~ ThursdayThursday 19th. At daybreak feelingthat we were in a very unsafe situation, I counselled the camp tomove forward without delay and con-tinue a lively march for about ninemiles where we stopped for breakfast.While passing through Richmond, Br.Luke Johnson observed a black womanin a gentleman's garden near theroad. She beckoned to him andsaid, "Come here massa"; she wasevidently much agitated in her feelings.He went up to the fence and she saidto him, "There is a company of menlaying in wait here who are calcula-ting to kill you this morning as youpass through.["] We halted for breakfaston an eminance near a farm-house.The owner furnished us with a largequantity of milk which gave a greatrelish to our bacon and corn dodgerwhich our company had purchasedthat morning. When we asked the priceof his milk he replied, "He is a mean 
 man that will sell milk. I couldhave let you had more if I hadknown that you were coming"; andhe further said; "You have many ene-mies about here and you may meetwith some trouble and it is a dam'dshame that every man can't comeup and enjoy his religion andeverything else without being molested."It was near noon when we fin-ished our breakfast and we passedon in fine spirits determined to gothrough and meet the brethren inClay County. We travelled but a shortdistance when one wagon broke downand the wheels ran off from othersand there seemed to be many things tohinder our progress although we strovewith all diligence to speed our wayforward. This evening we campedon an elevated piece of land be-tween Little Fishing and Big FishingRivers which was(?) formed by sevensmall streams or branches. As we hal-ted and were making preparationsfor the night, five men armed withguns, two of whom had swords rodeinto our camp and told us we should 
 "See hell enough before morning"; andtheir accompanying oaths partook ofall the malice of demons. Theytold us that sixty men were comingfrom Richmond, Ray County, andseventy more from Clay County tojoin the Jackson County mob whohad sworn our utter destruction. Theweather was pleasant.As Jazemiah B. Smith was takinghis bedding out of the wagon hediscovered a large rattle snake whichhe had carried with him all day.During the day the Jackson Co-unty mob to the number of about200 made arrangements to cross theMissouri River above the mouth ofFishing River at William's Ferry, intoClay County and be ready to meetthe Richmond mob near FishingRiver ford for our utter destruction.But after the first scow load ofabout forty had been taken acrossthe river, the scow in returning wasmet by a squall and had greatdifficulty in reaching the Jacksonside by dark.Wilford Woodruff states that "when 
 the five men entered our camp therewas not a cloud to be seen inthe whole heavens, but as the menleft the camp there was a smallblack cloud appeared in the north-west and it began to unroll itselflike a scroll and in a few min-utes the whole heavens were coveredwith a pall as black as ink. Thisindicated a sudden storm which soonbroke upon us with wind, rain, thun-der, lightning and hail. Our bedswere soon afloat and our tents blowndown over our heads. We all fledinto the Baptist Meeting House. As theprophet Joseph came in shakingthe water from his hat and clothinghe said, "Boys, there is some mean-ing in this—God is in the storm."We sang praises to God and layall night on the benches under coverwhile our enemies were in the peltingstorm. It was reported that themob cavalry who fled into the school-house tried to hold their horses by thebridles between the logs, but whenthe heavy hail struck them, they allbroke away skinning the fingers of 
 those who held them. The horses fledbefore the storm and were not foundfor several days. It was reportedthat the Captain of the company inthe school house said that it was ad—d strange thing that they coulddo nothing against the d—d Mormonsbut what there must be a d—d hailstorm or some other d—d thing tohinder them from doing anything.But they did not feel disposed toacknowledge that God was fightingour battles."The storm was tre-mendous—wind and rain, hail andthunder met them in great wrath andsoon softened their direful courage andfrustrated all their designs "to kill JoeSmith and his army." Instead ofcontinuing firing, which they commenced,they crowded under wagons, into hol-low trees, filled one old shanty &c. andwhen the storm was over their ammu-nition was soaked; and the party inClay County were extremely anxiousin the morning to return to Jacksonhaving experienced the pitiless peltingsof the storm all night. And as soon as arrangements could be made this 
 "forlorn hope" took the "back track" forIndependence to join the main bodyof the mob, fully satisfied as werethe survivors of the company whowere drowned that when Jehovah fights,they would rather be absent. The grati-fication is too terrible.Very little hail fell in our camp,but from one half to one mile aroundus the ^hail-^stones or lumps of ice cut downthe crops of corn and vegetation gen-erally, even cutting limbs from treeswhile the trees themselves were twistedinto withes by the wind. The light-ning flashed incessantly which cau-sed it to be so light in our campthrough the night that we could dis-cern the most minute object. The roar-ing of the thunder was tremendous.The earth trembled and quaked,the rain fell in torrents, and itseemed as if the mandate of ven-gence had gone forth from the Godof battles to protect his servants fromthe destruction of their enemies, forthe hail fell on them and not onus, and we suffered no harm ex-cept the blowing down of some of 
 our tents and getting wet, while ourenemies had holes made in theirhats and otherwise received damagesuch as the breaking of their rifle-stocks and the fleeing of their horsesthrough fear and pain. Many ofmy little band received shelter in anold meeting house through this night.In the morning the water in BigFishing River was about forty feet deepwhere the previous evening it was nomore than to our ankles: and ourenemies swore that the water rose thirtyfeet in thirty minutes in the Little Fish-ing River.They reported that one of their menwas killed by lightning, and that ano-ther had his hand torn off by hishorse drawing his hand between thelogs of a corn crib while he washolding him from the inside; andthey declared "If that was the wayGod fought for the God damned Mor-mons, they might as well go homeabout their business."June 20, 1834 ~ FridayFriday 20th. This morning I coun-selled the brethren to discharge all theirfire arms, when it was found we 
 had near six hundred shots, very fewof which missed fire, which shows howvery careful the brethren had been intaking care of their arms during thestorm. We went five miles on the prai-rie where we could procure food forourselves and horses, and defend our-selves from the rage of our enemies.June 21, 1834 ~ SaturdayWhile in this situation, on Saturday, 21st,Col. Sconce with two other leading menfrom Ray County came to see us desiringto know what our intentions were; "for"says he, "I see that there is an al-mighty power that protects this people;for I started from Richmond, Ray Coun-ty, with a company of armed menhaving a fixed determination to destroyyou; but was kept back by the stormand was not able to reach you." Whenhe entered our camp he was seized withsuch a trembling that he was obligedto sit down to compose himself; andwhen he had made known the ob-ject of their visit, I arose and address-ing them gave a relation of the suf-ferings of the Saints in Jackson Coun-ty, and also of our persecutions gener-ally, and what we had suffered 
 by our enemies for our religion, andthat we had come one thousandmiles to assist our brethren to bringthem clothing, &c and to reinstate themupon their own lands, and that wehad no intention to molest or injureany people, but to administer to thewants of our afflicted friends; andthat the evil reports circulated aboutus were false and got up by ourenemies to procure our destruction.When I had closed a lengthy speechthe spirit of which melted them intocompassion they arose and offered metheir hands and said they woulduse their influence to allay the excite-ment which every where prevailed aga-inst us, and they wept when theyheard of our afflictions and perse-cutions and that our intentions weregood. Accordingly they went forthamong the people and made unwear-ied exertions to allay the excitement.Bris. Ezra Thayre and Joseph Hancock were ^(are)^ sick with the cholera. ThomasHays was taken sick today (this isfulfillment of the prophecy given June3rd). The brethren in Clay County wrote 
 the same day the following to the com-mitte of the Jackson County mob.Clay Co. 21st, June, 1834.Gentlemen: —Your propositionsof Monday last have been generallymade known to our people, andwe are instructed to inform youthat they cannot be acceeded to.Honorable propositions to you arenow making on our part, and wethink we shall be enable to deliver thesame to you the early part of nextweek.We are happy to have it in ourpower to give you assurances thatour brethren here together with thosewho have arrived from the east areunanimously disposed to make everysacrifice for an honorable adjustmentof our differences that could be requir-ed of free citizens of the United States.Negotiations at the camp are nowgoing on between some gentlemen ofthis county and our brethren, whichare calculated to allay the greatexcitement in your county. We areinformed that the citizens of Jackson 
 entertain fears that our brethren in-tend to invade their territory in ahostile manner. We assure you thattheir fears are groundless,—such isnot and never was our intentionSignid W. W. PhelpsW. E. McLellianA. S. GilbertJohn CorrillIsaac Morley.To S. C. Owen and others of theJackson Co. Committee." ^*2nd page 70 follows this^June 22, 1834 ~ SundaySunday 22nd. Br. Lyman Smithreceived a wound from the accidentaldischarge of a horse pistol from whichhe recovered in about three days.Cornelius Gillium, the sheriff of ClayCounty, came to the camp to hold con-sultation with us. I marched mycompany into a grove near by andformed in a circle, with Gillium inthe center. Gillium commenced bysaying that he had heard thatJoseph Smith was in the camp, andif so he would like to see him. Iarose and replied, "I am the man"This is the first time that I had 
 been discovered or made known to myenemies since I left Kirtland. Gil-lium then gave us some instructionsconcerning the manners, customs, anddispositions of the people &c and whatcourse we ought to pursue to securetheir favor and protection, makingcertain inquiries to which we replied;these were afterward published and willappear under date of publication.I received the following revelationgiven on Fishing River Mo., June 22nd 1834.^See Rev. June 22nd 1834.^1st Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that youmay learn my will concerning theredemption of mine afflicted people.2 Behold I say unto you were it notfor the transgressions of my people, speak-ing concerning the Church, and not in-dividuals, they might have been redeem-ed even now; but behold they have notlearned to be obedient to the thingswhich I require at their hands but arefull of all manner of evil and donot impart of their substance, as becom-eth Saints, to the poor and afflictedamong them, and are not united ac-cording to the union required by law 
 of the Celestial Kingdom and Zioncannot be built up.Previous to crossing the Mississippi,I had called the camp together andtold them that in consequence of thedisobedience of some, who had beenunwilling to listen to my words, buthad rebelled, God had decreed thatsickness should come upon the campand if they did not repent and hum-ble themselves before God, they shoulddie like sheep with the rot; that Iwas sorry but could not help it; thescourge must come, repentance andhumility may mitigate the chastisementbut cannot altogether avert it, as therewere some who would not give heedto my words.June 23, 1834 ~ MondayMonday June 23rd. ^For additional see Millennial Star Vol 157.86.^ During this daya council of High Priests assembled infulfilment of the revelation given theday previous and the following indi-viduals were called and chosen asthey were made manifest unto me bythe voice of the spirit and revelationto receive their endowments.Edward Partridge was called andchosen to go to Kirtland and re- 
 but he said he could not do it.Peter Whitmer Jr., Simeon Carter, NewelKnight, Parley P.

 differences existing between our peopleor society and the inhabitants of JacksonCounty upon honorable and constitutionalprinciples.Therefore, if the said inhabitants ofJackson County will not let us return toour lands in peace, we are willing topropose firstly:— That twelve disinterestedmen, six to be chosen by our people andsix by the inhabitants of Jackson County,and these twelve men shall say whatthe sands [lands] of those men are worth inthat county who cannot consent to livewith us: and they shall receive theirmoney for the same in one year fromthe time the treaty is made, andnone of our people shall enter the coun-ty to reside till the money is paid.The said twelve men shall havepower also to say what the damagesshall be for the injuries we have sus-tained in the destruction of property andin being driven from our possessions;which amount of damages shall bededucted from the amount for their lands.Our object is peace, and an earlyanswer will be expected(Signed) W.

 Edward PartridgeJohn CorrillIsaac MorleyJohn WhitmerA. S. GilbertJune 24, 1834 ~ TuesdayJune 24th. We resumed our march forLiberty, Clay County by a circuitousroute around the head of FishingRiver, to avoid the deep water.When within five or six miles ofLiberty we were met by Gen. Atchisonand other gentlemen who desired us notto go to Liberty because the feelings ofthe people were so much enraged againstus. At their solicitations we changedour course, wheeled to the left and cross-ing the prairie and woodland cameto Br. A. S. Gilbert's residence andencamped on the bank of Rush Creekin Br. Barker's field.^*^ This night the C^c^holera burst forthupon us and about midnight it wasmanifest in its most terrific form,—ourears were saluted with cries and moan-ings and lamentations on every hand.Even those on guard fell to the earthwith their guns in their hands, so too—sudden and powerful was the attack 
 of this terrible disease.At the commencement I attemptedto lay on hands for their recoverybut I quickly learned by painfulexperience that when the great Jehovahdecrees destruction upon any peopleand makes known his determination,man must not attempt to stay hishand. The moment I attemptedto rebuke the disease, I was attacked;it seized upon me like the talons ofa hawk, and I said to the brethrenif I had had my work done, youwould have had to tumble me intothe ground without a coffin; and hadI not desisted I must have saved thelife of my brother by the sacrifice of myown.June 25, 1834 ~ WednesdayJune 25th. Early this morning the campwas separated into small bands anddispersed among the brethren living inthe vicinity.I wrote and sent by ex-press to Messrs. Thornton, Doniphan, andAtchison as follows:—Rush Creek, Clay County,June 25th, 1834.Gentlemen:—Our company of men 
 advanced yesterday from their encamp-ment beyond Fishing River to Rush Creek,where their tents are again pitched. Butfeeling disposed to adopt every pacificmeasure that can be done withoutjeopardizing our lives, to quiet the pre-judices and fears of some part of thecitizens of this county, we have conclu-ded that our company shall be imme-diately dispersed, and continue so tillevery effort for an adjustment of dif-ferences between us and the people ofJackson has been made on our part,that would in any wise be requiredof us by disinterested men of republicanprinciples.I am respectfully,Your obedient servant,Joseph Smith Jr.N. B.—You are now corresponding withthe govenor, (as I am informed;) willyou do us the favor to acquaint himof our efforts for a compromise. This in-formation we want conveyed to the gove-nor, inasmuch as his ears are stifledwith reports from Jackson, of our hostileintentions, &cJ.S. 
 I left Rush Creek in company withDavid Whitmer and two other brethren forthe western part of Clay County. Whiletraveling we called at the house of Mr.Moss for a drink of water. The womanof the house shouted from the door thatthey had no water for Mormons—thatthey were afraid of the Cholera &c; atthe same time throwing out her armsas if defending herself from the cholerain the form of a personage. We turnedand departed according to the command-ment, and before a week had passedthe cholera entered that house and thatwoman and three others of the familywere dead.When the cholera made its appearance,Elder John S. Carter was one of the firstwho stepped forward to rebuke it, andupon this was instantly seized, and be-came the first victim in the camp. Hedied about 6 o'clock in the afternoon; andSeth Hitchcock died in about thirty min-utes after. (and Erastus Rudd died aboutthe same moment although half a miledistant; he was buried by Jesse Smith,Geo. A. Smith and two or three others;while burying him Jesse Smith was 
 attacked with the cholera.As it was impossible to obtain cof-fins, the brethren rolled the corpses inblankets, carried them on a horse-sledabout half a mile, burrid them in thebank of a small stream which emptiesinto Rush Creek, all of which wasaccomplished by dark. When they hadreturned from the burial, the brethrenunited, covenanted and prayed, hop-ing the disease would be staid; butin vain, for while thus covenanting, EberWilcox died; and while some were dig-ging the grave, others stood sentry withtheir fire arms, watching their enemies.June 26, 1834 ~ ThursdayJune 26th. The elders wrote govenorDunklin as follows:—Sir,—A company of our peopleexceeding two hundred men arrived in thiscounty the 19th inst. and encamped abouttwelve miles from Liberty, where they weremet by several gentlemen from this andRay County, who went by request of thepeople to ascertain the motives and de-signs of our people in approaching thiscounty; and as the deputation was com-posed of gentlemen who appeared to 
 possess humane and republican feelings,our people were rejoiced at the opportu-nity of an interchange of feelings, andan open and frank avowal of alltheir views and intentions in emigra-ting to this country with their arms. Afull explanation having been given in apublic address by our brother Joseph SmithJr., which produced great satisfaction, thesame in substance was afterwards re-duced in writing, and handed to theaforesaid gentlemen, that it might bemade public, as the shedding of bloodis, and ever has been, foreign andrevolting to our feelings. For this reason,we have patiently endured the greatestindignities that freemen of this republichave ever been called to suffer; andwe still continue to bear with heart-rend-ings a deprivation of our rights, havecommenced negociations with the inhab-itants of Jackson for a compromise; where-in proposals on our part have beenmade, which have been acknowledgedby every disinterested man to be highlyhonorable and liberal. An answer toour propositions has not yet been re- 
 ceived from Jackson.If we fail in this attempt, weintend to make another effort and goall lengths that would be required byhuman or divine law. As our propo-sals and correspondence with the inha-bitants of Jackson, will doubtless hereafterbe published, we think it unnecessary todetail the same in this communication.Our right to our soil in Jackson Countywe shall forever claim, and to obtainpeaceful possession we are willing tomake great sacrifices. To allay excite-ment in the county, the aforesaid com-pany of emigrants have dispersed toawait the final end of all negotia-tions that can be made with the saidcounty of Jackson.Within the last week one of ourmen being near the ferry, was seizedby some Jackson citizens, while in thiscounty, threatened with death if hemade resistance, and carried over theriver, prisoner to Independence, wherehe was put under guard one day,and after hearing many threats, wasliberated. The houses of several of our 
 brethren in this county have been forci-bly entered by some of the inhabitantsof Jackson, and a number of gunsand small arms taken therefrom. Wherethe men were absent from their houses,loaded guns were presented to the fe-males, and their lives threatened if theymade resistance, and ^as^ we have beeninformed, and have no doubt of thefact.[rest of page blank] 
 Your second order for the restoration ofour arms was received last mail; we havenot yet done any thing with it. Hopingthat the influence of the inhabitants of Jack-son County will materially lessen in thesurrounding counties and the pepoople be-come more tranquil, we think it wisdomto defer petitioning for a guard whilethere exists a hope of a compromise, &c.We believe that the President would ren-der us assistance in obtaining possession ofour lands if aided by the executive of thisStakte in a petition, and thereby put anend to serious evils that are growingout of the Jackson outrage. In a letter fromyour Excellency of April 20th, we had a wordon the subject of petitioning.We should be pleased to hear further, andwould here observe that no communicationfrom the Executive, giving his opinion or ad-vice, will be made public if requested not todo so. We are Respectfully and with greatregard your Obt. Servants,A. S. Gilbert,W. W. Phelps.John Corrill.The drafting and signing of the abovewas the last public act of that keeper of the 
 Lord's Store-House, Algernon S. Gilbert, for hewas attacked with the cholera the same dayand died about the 29th, according to hisown words, that he would rather die, thango forth to preach the gospel to the gentiles.The following is from the chairman ofthe committee of the Jackson Mob to our Lawyer.Independence, Mo. June 26th, 1834.Mr. Amos Rees— Dear Sir:—Since my returnfrom Liberty, I have been busily engagedin conversing with the most influential menof our county endeavoring to find out ifpossible what kind of a compromise willsuit with the Mormons on their part. The peoplehere en masse I find out will do nothinglike acceeding to their last proposition. We willhave a meeting if possible on Monday next,at which time the proposals of the Mormonswill be answered. In the mean time, I wouldbe glad that they, the Mormons would cast aneye back of Clinton and see if that is not a country calculated for them. Yours Respectfully,S. C. Owens.The cholera continued its ravages aboutfour days when a remedy for purging, vom-iting and cramping was discovered; name-ly: dipping the person afflicted in cold water 
 or pouring it upon them, and givingthem whiskey thickened with flour to theconsistence of starch. (Whiskey was the onlykind of spirits that could be procured atthis place). About sixty-eight of the saintssuffered from this disease, of which numberfourteen died, viz: John S. Carter, Eber Wilcox,Seth Hitchcock, Erastus Rudd, Algernon SidneyGilbert, Alfred Jesse J. Smith, Warren IngallsFisk, Edward Ives, Noah Johnson, Jesse B. Law-son, Robert McDord, Elial Strong, Jesse J. Smith,Warren Ingalls and Betsey Parrish. Among themost active of those that were engaged intaking care of the sick at the camp, buryingthe dead, &c were John D. Parker, John Tanner,Nathan Tanner, Joseph B. Nobles, Brigham Young,Joseph Young, Heber C. Kimball, Luke Johnson,and Eleazer Miller.I sent Hiram Page with instructions to bringJesse J. Smith and Geo. A. Smith to me at allhazards to the west part of the country, havinghad intimations that they were sick, he foundthat Jesse had been severely racked with thecholera all day, Geo. A. Smith had taken careof him for upwards of thirty hours. Dr. Wil-liams decided that the cholera had left himand would recover if not moved, on themorning of the 28th, Geo. A. Smith was attack- 
 ed and was immediately mounted on a hard riding horse, rode 15 miles and cameto me.The last days of June I spent with myold Jackson County friends in the western partof Clay County.July 1, 1834 ~ TuesdayOn the first of July Jesse J. Smith died. Icrossed the Missouri River in company with a few friends into Jackson County, to set myfeet once more on the "goodly land;" and onthe 2nd I went down near Liberty and visitedthe brethren. A considerable number of thecamp met me at Lyman Wight's. I toldthem if they would humble themselves beforethe Lord and covenant to keep His command-ments, and obey my counsel, the plague shouldbe stayed from that hour and there shouldnot be another case of the cholera amongthem. The brethren covenanted to that effectand the plague was stayed. W. Woodruffsays, I was present at the meeting of Josephwith his brethren at Lyman Wights and theProphet seemed more bowed down with sorrowat the loss of his brethren than I ever sawhim in my life. At the same time hewas clothed with the Spirit of God andwith humility; and when all the Brethren 
 covenanted with uplifted hands to Heaventhat they would humble themselves the Lordand keep his commandments and obey thecounsel of the Prophet, the power of God restedupon them and we were all bathed in tears.There was not another case of cholera amongthe saints from that hour."This day the "Enquirer" published the cor-respondence between the Sheriff and the Camp,of the 22nd of June, as follows:"Being a citizen of Clay County and knowingthat there is considerable excitement amongstthe people thereof; and also knowing thatdifferent reports are arriving almost hourly,and being requested by the Hon. J. F. Rylandto meet the Mormons under arms, and ob-tain from the leaders thereof the correctness ofthe various reports in circulation, the true in-tent and meaning of their present movemen-ts, and their views generally regarding thedifficulties existing between them and JacksonCounty, I did in company with other gentle-men call upon the said leaders of theMormons at their camp in Clay County,—andnow give to the people of Clay County theirwritten statement containing the substance ofwhat passed between us. (Signed) Cornelius Gillium. 
 Propositions &c of the Mormons.Being called upon by the above namedgentlemen at our camp in Clay County toascertain from the leaders of our men, ourintentions, views and designs in approachingthis county in the manner that we have; wetherefore the more cheerfully comply with theirrequest because we are called upon by gentle-men of good feelings and who are disposedfor peace and an amicable adjustment ofthe difficulties existing between us and thepeople of Jackson County. The reports of ourintentions are various and have gone abroadin a light calculated to arouse the feelingsof almost every man. For instance, one re-port is that we intend to demolish the prin-ting office in Liberty: another report is thatwe intend crossing the Missouri River on Sun-day next, and falling upon women andchildren and slaying them: another isthat our men were employed to performthis expedition being taken from manufac-turing establishments in the East that hadclosed business: another^lso^ that we carried aflag bearing peace on one side and war orblood on the other: and various others too nu-merous to mention, all of which a plain 
 declaration of our intentions from under ourown hands will show are not correct.In the first place it is not our intentionto commit hostilities against any man orset of men. It is not our intention to in-jure any mans person or property exceptin defending ourselves. Our flag has beenexhibited to the above gentlemen who will beable to describe it. Our men were not takenfrom any manufacturing establishment. Itis our intention go back upon our Landsin Jackson County by order of the Executive ofthe State, if possible. We have brought ourarms with us for the purpose of self defence, asit is well known to almost every man ofthe State that we have every reason to putourselves in an attitude of defence, consider-ing the abuse we have suffered in JacksonCounty. We are anxious for a settlementof the difficulties existing between us upon hon-orable and Constitutional principles.We are willing for twelve disinterestedmen, six to be chosen by each party, andthese men shall say what the possessionsof those men are worth who cannot livewith us in the County; and they shall havetheir money in one year; and none of 
 the Mormons shall enter that county to re-side until the money is paid. The damagesthat we have sustained in consequenceof being driven away, shall also be left tothe above twelve men; or they may all livein the county if they choose and we willnever molest them if they will let us aloneand permit us to enjoy our rights. We wantto live in peace with all men; and equalrights is all we ask. We wish to becomepermanent citizens of this state and wish tobear our proportion in support of the govern-ment and to be protected by its laws. If theabove propositions are complied with, we arewilling to give security on our part; andwe shall want the same of the people ofJackson County for the performance of thisagreement. We do not wish to settle down ina body except where we can purchase thelands with money; for to take possession byconquest, or the shedding of blood, is entirelyforeign to our feelings. The shedding of bloodwe shall not be guilty of until all justand honorable means among men proveinsufficient to restore peace. (Signed) Joseph SmithJr. F. G.

 To John Lincoln, Geo. R. Morehead }John Sconce, James H. Long, James Collins }July 3, 1834 ~ ThursdayOn the 3rd of July the High Priests of Zionassembled in the yard of Colonel Arthur's whereLyman Wight lived, in Clay County, and I pro-ceeded to organize a High Council agreeable tothe revelation and pattern given at Kirtland,for the purpose of settling important businessthat might come before them, which couldnot be settled by the Bishop and his council.David Whitmer was elected President and WilliamW. Phelps and John Whitmer assistant presidents.The following High Priests namely, ChristianWhitmer, Newel Knight, Lyman Wight, CalvinBeebe, William E. McLellin, Solomon Hancock,Thomas B. Marsh, Simeon Carter, Parley P. Pratt,Orson Pratt, John Murdock and Levi Jackmanwere appointed counsellors and the Council ad-journed to Monday. Frederick G. Williams wasclerk of the meeting.I authorized General Lyman Wight to givea discharge to every man of the camp whohad proved himself faithful, certifying thatfact, and giving him leave to return home.From this time I continued to give instructionsto the members of the High Council, Elders, those 
 who had traveled in the Camp with me, andsuch others as desired information, until the7th when the Council assembled according to ad-journment at the house of Elder Lyman Wight,present fifteen High Priests, eight elders, four Priests,eight Teachers, three deacons and - - members.After singing and prayer, I gave the Councilsuch instructions in relation to their high cal-ling, as would enable them to proceed to min-ister in their office, agreeable to the pattern here-tofore given; read the revelation on the subject,and told them that if I should now be takenaway, I had accomplished the great workthe Lord had laid upon me, and that whichI had desired of the Lord; and that I haddone my duty in organizing the High Council,through which council the will of the Lord mightbe known on all important occasions, in thebuilding up of Zion, and establishing truth inthe earth.It was voted that those who were appoin-ted on the third, should be confirmed in theirappointments. I then ordained David WhitmerPresident, and W. W. Phelps and John Whitmerassistants; and their twelve counsellors. The twelvecounselors then proceeded to cast lots to knowwho should speak first, and the order of speaking 
 which resulted as follows, namely:Simeon Carter No. 1 Parley P. Pratt No. 2William McLellin " 3 Calvin Beebe " 4Levi Jackman " 5 Solomon Hancock " 6Christian Whitmer " 7 Newel Knight " 8Orson Pratt " 9 Lyman Wight " 10Thomas B. Marsh " 11 John Murdock " 12Father Whitmer came forward and blessedhis three sons, namely: David, John and CristianWhitmer in the name of the Lord. Also FatherKnight blessed his son Newel. Bishop Partridgestated to the council, that a greater responsibi-lity rested upon him than before their organi-zation, as it was not his privilege to counselwith any of them except the council and hisown counsellors, and desired their prayersthat he might be enabled to act in righteous-ness. I next presented the case of W. W. Phelpsto the Council to have their decision whetherhe should take his family to Kirtland, andif so, when he shall start, as it had beendeemed necessary for him to assist in the prin-ting establishment. It was motioned andcarried that four of the counsellors speak onthe subject, two on each side, namely; Sime-on Carter and William E. McLellin for the Plain-tiff; and Parley Pratt and Calvin Beebe for the 
 Church. After hearing the pleas, the Presidentdecided that it was the duty of W. W. Phelps togo to Kirtland to assist in printing and thathis family remain in the region where they were,and that he have an honorable discharge fromhis station in Zion for a season. (as soon as hecan accomplish his business) signed by the Pres-ident and Clerk.It was then proposed by W. W. Phelps thatDavid Whitmer, the President of the Church in Zion,should go to Kirtland and assist in promotingthe cause of Christ, as being one of the three Wit-nesses. This case was argued by Levi Jackmanand Christian Whitmer in behalf of the plain-tiff, and Solomon Hancock and Newel Knightfor the Church; after which it was decided, asbefore, that Brother David Whitmer go to theEast and assist in the great work of the gath-ering, and be his own judge as to leavinghis family or taking them with him. It wasalso decided that John Whitmer and WilliamE. McLellin go east as soon as convenient. TheHigh Priests, Elders, Priests, Teachers, Deacons andmembers present then covenanted with handsuplifted to Heaven, that they would upholdBrother David Whitmer as President in Zionin my absence, and John Whitmer and 
 W. W. Phelps as assistant presidents or coun-sellors, and myself as first President of theChurch; and to uphold one another by faithand prayer.Previous to entering into this covenant, andin pursuance of the revelation to the Saints tosue for, and proclaim peace to the ends of theearth, the following appeal was written and san-ctioned by the High Council and first Presiden-cy of the Church at the foregoing sitting. Presi-dent Whitmer closed the Council by prayer. F.G. Williams was clerk.An Appeal.Whereas the Church of Christ, recently styled theChurch - - - - - of the Latter-Day Saints con-tumeliously called "Mormons" or "Mormonites" hassuffered many privations, afflictions, persecutionsand losses on account of the religious belief andfaith of its members, which belief and faithare founded in the revealed word of God, asrecorded in the holy Bible, or the Book of Mormon,the revelations and commandments of ourSavior Jesus Christ; and whereas the said churchby revelation commenced removing to the wes-tern boundaries of the State of Missouri, wherelands were purchased of the government, and 
 where it was caluculated to purchase of thosewho were unwilling to reside with the Churchas a society, all lands that could be bought forthe purpose of building up a holy city unto God,a New Jerusalem — a place which we were desirousto call Zion, as we believe a place of refugefrom the scourge and plagues which are sooften mentioned in the Bible by the prophetsand apostles, that should be poured out uponthe earth in the last days; and whereas theinhabitants of Jackson County, Missouri, haveleagued and combined against said church,and have driven the Saints from their lands,and taken their arms from them, and burn-ed down many of their houses without anyprovocation; and whereas we have petitionedthe Governor of this State, and the Presidentof the United States for the redress of wrongs,(the law being put at defiance in Jackson Coun-ty) and for redemption of rights, that wemight be legally repossessed of our lands andproperty: and whereas the said inhabitants ofJackson County, have not only bound them-selves to keep us out of that county, but havearmed themselves cap a pie and even with can-non for war: and whereas our people resi-ding in the upper Missouri, have recently armed 
 themselves for military duty and self defence,seeing their arms taken from them by the in-habitants of Jackson County were purposely keptfrom them; and whereas a number of themembers of the Church in the east have emi-grated to this region of country to settle andjoin their Brethren, with arms to answer themilitary law, which has created some excite-ment among the inhabitants of the uppercounties of this State, whereupon to show thatour object was only the peaceable possession ofour rights and property, and to purchasemore land in the regions round about, we meta committee from Jackson County for compromise;and our emigrating brethren met some gentle-men from Clay and other counties to satisfythem that their motives were good and theirobject peace, which they did. and whereas thepropositions of the Jackson Committee could notbe accepted on our part because they proposedto "buy or sell" and to sell our land wouldamount to a denial of our faith, as thatland is the place where the Zion of God shallstand according to our faith and belief inthe revelations of God, and upon which Is-rael shall be gathered according to the Prophets:and secondly the propositions were unfair 
 not withstanding they offered double price for ourlands, in thirty days, or sell theirs at thesame rate; for this plain reason that thewhole large county of Jackson would be asthirty to one, or nearly so, in comparison withthe matter in question and in supposition, forone thousand dollars, two thousand dollarsto our people, was asking for three hundredthousand dollars, the exhorbitant sum of sixhundred thousand dollars, taking the landrich and poor, in thirty days! with the reproach-able, vicious, unamerican and unconstitutionalproviso that the committee on our part bindthemselves "That no Mormon should ever settlein Jackson County": and whereas our committeeproposed to the said Jackson Committee (if theywould not grant us our rights otherwise) thatour people would buy the land of those thatwere unwilling to live among our people inthat county, and pay them in one year; theyallowing the damage we have sustained inthe loss of a printing office, apparatus andbook work, houses, property, &c to come out ofthe purchase money, but no answer returned:and whereas to show our honest intentionsand awaken the friends of virtue, human-ity and equal rights, it becomes our duty 
 to lay our case before the world to be weighedin the balances of public opinion.Now, therefore, as citizens of the UnitedStates and leading Elders in the Church ofthe Latter-Day Saints residing in the stateof Missouri, in behalf of the Church we theundersigned do make this solemn appealto the people and constituted authorities ofthis nation and to the ends of the earth,for Peace; that we may have the privilegeof enjoying our religious rights and immu-nities and worship God according to thedictates of our own consciences as guaran-teed to every citizen by the constitutions of thenational and State governments. That althoughthe laws have been broken arend are defiedin Jackson County, we may be enabled to re-gain and enjoy our rights and property agree-able to law in this boasted land of liberty.Since the disgraceful combination of theinhabitants of Jackson County has set thelaw at defiance and put all hopes ofcriminal prosecution against them in thatvicinage beyond the reach of judge andjury, and left us but a distant expectationof civil remuneration for the great amountof damage we have sustained, necessity 
 compels us to complain to the world. And ifour cause and calamity are not sufficient toexcite the commisseration of the humane, andopen the hearts of the generous, and fire thespirits of the patriotic, then has sympathylost herself in the wilderness and justice fledfrom power; then has the dignity of the ermineshrunk at the gigantic front of a mob, andthe sacred mantle of freedom been caught upto Heaven where the weary are at rest and thewicked cannot come.To be obedient to the commandments of ourLord and Savior, some of the leaders of theChurch commenced purchasing lands in thewestern boundaries of the State of Missouri ac-cording to the revelations of God, for the city ofZion: in doing which no law was evaded,no rights infringed nor no principle of reli-gion neglected but the laudable foundation ofa glorious work begun for the salvation ofmankind in the last days agreeable to ourfaith and according to the promises in thesacred Scriptures of God.We verily bielieve, knowing that the Nation-al and State Constitutions, and the statutelaws of the land and the commandmentsof the Lord allowed all men to worship as they 
 pleased, that we should be protected, not onlyby all the laws of a free Republic, but byevery republican throughout the realms offreedom.The holy prophets had declared, "That itshould come to pass in the last days thatthe mountain of the Lord's House should beestablished in the top of the mountains andshould be exalted above the hills, and all na-tions should flow unto it. And many peopleshould go and say, come ye and let us goup to the mountain of the Lord, to the houseof the God of Jacob; and he will teach us ofhis ways and we will walk in his paths;for out of Zion shall go forth the law, andthe word of the Lord from Jerusalem." Andagain it was said by Joel seemingly tostrengthen the faith of the Latter-Day Saintsin the above "That whosoever should call nonthe name of the Lord, should be delivered, forin Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be de-liverance as the Lord hath said, and in theremnant whom the Lord shall call." TheBook of Mormon which we hold equally sa-cred with the Bible, says "That a new Jerusa-lem shall be built upon this land unto theremnant of the seed of Joseph, for the which 
 things there has been a type." In fact, allthe prophets from Moses to John the Revelator,have spoken concerning these things, andin all good faith, by direct revelation fromthe Lord, as in days of old, we commencedthe glorious work, that a holy city — a newJerusalem, even Zion might be built up, anda temple reared in this generation, where-unto, as saith the Lord, all nations should beinvited. Firstly the rich and the learned, thewise and the noble; and after that comeththe day of his power. But the inhabitants ofJackson County arrayed themselves againstus because of our faith and belief and des-troyed our printing establishment, to preventthe spread of the work, and drove men wom-en and children from their lands, housesand homes, to perish in the approachingwinter, while every blast carried the wailingsof women and the shrieks of children acrossthe wide spread prairie, sufficiently horribleto draw tears from the savage or melt a heartof stone!Now that the world may know that ourfaith in the work and word of the Lord isfirm and unshaken, and to show all nations,kindreds, tongues and people that our object 
 is good, for the good of all, we come before thegreat family of mankind for peace and asktheir hospitality and assistance for our comfortand the preservation of our persons and property,and solicit their charity for the great causeof gGod. We are well aware that many slan-derous reports and ridiculous stories are in cir-culation against our religion and society, butas wise men will hear both sides, and thenjudge, we sincerely hope and trust that thestill, small voice of truth, will be heard and ourgreat revelations read and candidly comparedwith the prophecies of the Bible, that the greatcause of our redeemer may be supported bya liberal share of public opinion as well as theunseen power of God. It will be seen by areference to the Book of Commandments, page135, that the Lord has said to the Church, andwe meant to live by his words, "Let no manbreak the law of the land, for he that keepeth theLaws of God, hath no need to break the lawsof the land;" therefore as the people of God, we comebefore the world and claim protection by law fromthe common officers of justice in every neighborhoodwhere our people may be; we claim the sameat the hands of the governors of the several Statesand of the President of the United States, and of 
 the friends of humanity and justice in everyclime and country on the globe.By the desperate acts of the inhabitants ofJackson County, many hundreds of AmericanCitizens are deprived of their lands and rights; andit is reported that we mean to regain our posses-sions, and even Jackson County "by the shedding ofblood"; but if any man will take the pains toread the 1353rd page of the Book of Commandmentshe will find it there said, "Wherefore the land ofZion shall not be obtained but by purchase, or byblood, otherwise there is none inheritance for you.And if by purchase behold you are blessed; andif by blood, as you are forbidden to shed blood lo! yourenemies are upon you and you shall be scourgedfrom city to city and from synagogue to syna-gogue, and but few shall stand to receive aninheritance." So we declare that we have evenmeant, and now mean to purchase the landof our inheritance like all other honest menof the government and of those who wouldrather sell their farms than live in our society.And as thousands have done before us, wesolicit the aid of the children of men, andof government to help us obtain our rights inJackson County and the land whereon the Zionof God, according to our faith, shall stand in 
 the last days, for the salvation and gatheringof Israel.Let no man be alarmed because our soci-ety has commenced gathering to build a cityand a house for the Lord as a refuge frompresent evils and coming calamities. Our fore-fathers came to the goodly land of Americato shun persecution and enjory their religiousopinions and rights as they thought proper;and the Lord after much tribulation blessedthem and has said that we should continueto importune for redress and redemption by thehands of those who are placed as ruler andare in authority over us, according to the lawsand constitution of the people, which he has suf-fered to be establish and should be maintain-ed for the rights and protection of all fleshaccording to just and holy principles; thatevery man act in doctrine and in principlepertaining to futurity according to the moralagency which  the has given unto them; thatevery man may be accountable for his ownsins in the day of Judgment; and for thispurpose he has established the constitution ofthis land by the hands of wise men whom heraised up unto this very purpose, and re-deemed the land by the shedding of blood. 
 Now we seek peace, and ask our rightseven regress and redemption at the hands ofthe rulers of this nation; not only our landsand property in Jackson County but for freetrade with all men and unmolested emigra-tion to any part of the Union, and for ourinherent right to worship God as we please.We ask the rights because they have beentaken from us, or abridged by the violence andusurpation of the inhabitants of Jackson County.As a people we hold ourselves amenable tothe laws of the land, and while the governmentremains as it is, the right to emigrate fromState to State: from Territory to Territory: fromcounty to county, and from vicinity to vicinity,is open to all men of whatsoever trade or creed,without hindrance or molestation; and aslong as we are justifiable and honest in theeyes of the law, we claim it, whether we removeby single families or in bodies of hundreds, withthat of carrying the necessary arms and accou-trements for military duty; and we believethat all honest men who love their countryand their country's glory and have a wish tosee the law magnified and made honorable,will not only help perpetuate the great legacyof freedom that came unimparired from the 
 July 1834.hands of our venerable fathers, to us, but theywill also protect us from insult and injury,and aid the work of God, that they mayreap a reward in the regions of bliss, whenall men receive according to their works.In relation to our distress, from the wantof our lands in Jackson County, and for thewant of the property destroyed by fire and waste,rather than do any act contrary to law, wesolemnly appeal to the people with whom wetarry, for protection from insult and harm;, andfor the comforts of life by labor, or otherwise, whilewe seek peace and satisfaction of our enemiesthrough every possible and honorable meanswhich humanity can dictate or philanthrophyurge, or religion require.We are citizens of this republic, and we askour rights as republicans, not merely in ourrestoration to our lands and property in JacksonCounty, Missouri, but it being considered honest inour faith, honest in our deal, and honest beforeGod, till by due course of law. We may be provedotherwise, reserving the right of every man's be-ing held amenable to the proper authority forhis own crimes and sins."Crowns won by blood, by blood must be main-tained," and to avoid blood and strife, and 
 more fully satisfy the world that our objectis peace and good will to all mankind, wehereby appeal for peace to the ends of the earth,and ask the protection of all people while weuse every fair means in our power to obtainour rights and immunities without force; set-ting an example for all true believers that wewill not yield our faith and principles, forany earthly considerations whereby a precedentmight be established, that a majority maycrush any religious sect with impunity; know-ing that if we give up our rights in JacksonCounty, farewell to society! farewell to religion!farewell to right! farewell to property! farewell tolife! the fate of our church now, might becomethe fate of the Methodist next week, the Catholicsnext month, and the overthrow of all societiesnext year; leaving nation after nation a widewaste where reason and friendship once were!Another and the great object which we meanto help accomplish is the salvation of thesouls of men; and to bring to pass such aglorious work, like many other religious denomi-nations in all ages, we shall license Eldersto preach the everlasting Gospel to all nationsaccording to the great commandment of ourLord and Savior Jesus Christ, as recorded in 
 St. Mathew: "Go ye therefore and teach all na-tions, baptizing them in the name of the Fatherand of the Suon and of the Holy Ghost, teach-ing them to observe all things whatsoever I havecommanded you: and lo I am with youalways, even unto the end of the world."Thus we shall send laborers into the Lord'svineyard to gather wheat and prepare the earthagainst the day when desolation shall bepoured out without measure; and as it nowis and ever has been considered one of themost honorable and glorious employments ofmen to carry good tidings to the nations,so we shall expect the clemency of all men,while we go forth for the last time to gatherIsrael for the glory of God, that he maysuddenly come to his temple; that all na-tions may come and worship in his pres-ence, when there shall be none to molest ormake afraid, but the earth shall be filledwith his knowledge and glory. We live inan age of fearful imagination, with all thesincerity that common men are endowed with,the Saints have labored without pay to instructthe United States that the gathering hadcommenced in the western boundaries ofMissouri, to build a holy city, where, as may 
 be seen in the 18th chapter of Isaiah: "The presentshould be brough[t] unto the Lord of Hosts of a people scattered and peeled and from a peopleterrible from their beginning hitherto; - - - - - - anation meeted out and trodden under foot;whose land the rivers have spoiled;, to the peaceof the name of the Lord of Hosts the MountZion." And how few have come forth rejoicingthat the hour of redemption! and some thatcame have turned away, which may causethousands to exclaim amid the general confu-sion and fright of the times, "Remember Lot'sWife."It would be a work of supercerogation tolabor to show the truth of the gathering of theChildren of Israel in these last days: For theprophet told us long ago that it should nomore be said, "The Lord liveth that brought upthe Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,but the Lord liveth that brought up the Chil-dren of Israel from the land of the northand from all the lands whither he haddriven them;" and so it must be for the hon-or and glory of God.The faith and religion of the Latter-DaySaints, are founded upon the old Scriptures,the Book of Mormon, and direct revelation 
 from God, and while every event that transpiresaround us, in evidence of the truth of them,and an index that the great and terrible dayof the Lord is near, we intreat the philanthro-pist, the moralist and the honorable men ofall creeds, and sects, to read our publications,to examine the Bible, the Book of Mormon andthe Commandments, and listen to the fulnessof the gospel, and judge whether we are enti-tled to the credit of the world, for honest motivesand true principles.A cloud of bad omen seems to hangover this generation. Men start up at the im-pulse of the moment and defy and outstrip alllaw, while the destroyer is also abroad in theearth wasting flesh without measure andnone can stay his course. In the midstof such portentious times, we feel an anxiousdesire to prepare, and help others prepare forcoming events; and we candidly believethat no honest man will put forth hishand to stop the work of the Lord, or persecutethe Saints.In the name of Jesus, we entreat the peo-ple of this nation to pause before they rejectthe words of the Lord, or his servants: These,like all flesh, may be imperfect "But God is 
 pure hear ye him!While we ask peace and protection for theSaints, wherever they may be, we also solicitthe charity and benevolence of all the worthyon earth, to purchase the righteous a holyhome, a place of rest and a land of peace,believing that no man who knows he hasa soul will keep back his mite, but cast it infor the benefit of Zion; thus when time is nolonger, he with all the ransomed of the Lordmay stand in the fulness of joy, and viewthe grand pillar of Heaven, which was builtby the faith and charity of the Saints, beginningat Adam with this motto in the base "Repent and live" surrounded with a beautiful circlesign supported by a cross, about midway upits lofty column, staring the world in letters ofblood "The Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand" and finishedwith a plain top, towering up in the midstof the celestial world, around which is writtenby the finger of Jehovah: "Eternal Life is the great-est gift of God."Although we may fail to show all menthe truth of the fulness of the Gospel, yet wehope to be able to convince some that we areneither deluded nor fanatics, but like othermen have a claim on the world for land 
 and for a living, as good and as greatas our venerable fathers had for indepen-dence and liberty: that though the world hasbeen made to believe by false reports andvague stories, that the Saints (called Mormons)were meaner than the savages, still God hasbeen our help in time of trouble and hasprovided for us in due season; and to usethe language of Pope, he has let the work"Spread undivided" and "operate unspent."For the honor of our beloved country andthe continuation of its free government, we appealfor peace; for an example of forbearance, andthe diffusion of the everlasting Gospel, we appealto the humanity of all nations; and for theglory of God, before whom we must all answerfor the deeds done in life, and for the hopeof holiness hereafter, we mean to remain faith-ful to the end, continuing to pray to the Lordto spare us and the people from whatever isevil and not calculated to humble us, andprepare us for His presence and glory: at thesame time beseeching Him in the name ofJesus to extend His blessings to whom he will,and his mercy to all, till, by righteousnessthe kingdoms of this world become fair asthe sun and clear as the moon.

 July 8, 1834 ~ TuesdayOn the 8th I went to the eastern part of ClayCounty and held a meeting at the house ofThomas B. Marsh in the evening which was com-posed mostly of High Priests and Elders.July 9, 1834 ~ WednesdayAnd on the 9th I started for Kirtland in com-pany with my brother Hyrum, Frederick G. Williams,William E. McLellin and others in a wagon.July 10, 1834 ~ ThursdayJuly 10th. Elder Corrill wrote as follows:"Samuel C. Owens Esquire,Sir:—The last time I saw youin Liberty you said that an answer to ourproposals, you thought, would be forwarded soon,but it has not been done.We are anxiously waiting to have a com-promise effected if possible. Respecting our wheatin Jackson County, can it be secured so thatwe can receive the avails of it or not, seeingwe are at present prohibited the privilege.John Corrill.P.S.

Be assured that we do notwish to obtain them from any hostile inten-tions, but merely because the right of propertyis ours. If I remember right, there is one gunand a sword more then the order clalls for.John Corrill."There followed a copy of the Governor's order,similar to that of the Governor to Col. Lucas of the2nd of May.July 12, 1834 ~ SundayOn the 12th, the High Council of Zion assembledin Clay County, and appointed Edward Part-ridge, Orson Pratt, Isaac Morley, and ZebedeeColtrin to visit the scattered and afflicted Breth-ren in that region, and teach them the waysof truth and holiness, and set them in orderaccording as the Lord should direct; but thatwas not wisdom for the Elders generally to holdpublic meetings in that region.It was decided that Amasa Lyman as-sist Lyman Wight in his mission of gathering thestrength of the Lord's House as I had appoin-ted him.July 31, 1834 ~ ThursdayJuly 31st. The High Council of Zion assembled 
 and heard the report of Edward Partridge, OrsonPratt, Zebedee Coltrin and Isaac Morley, concer-ning the mission appointed them at the previouscouncil.President David Whitmer gave the councilsome good instruction; that it was their dutyto transact all business in order, and whenany case is brought forward for investigationevery member should be attentive and patient towhat is passing in all cases and avoid con-fusion and contention, which is offensive in thesight of the Lord. He also addressed the Eldersand said that it is not pleasing in the sightof the Lord for any man to go forth to preachthe gospel of peace unless he is qualified to setforth its principles in plainness to those he en-deavors to instruct, and also the rules and regu-lations of the Church of Latter Day Saints: forjust as a man is and as he teaches andacts, so will his followers be, let them be everso full of notions and whims. He also ad-dressed the congregation and told them thatit was not wisdom for the brethren to vote atthe approaching election, and the Council ac-quiesced in the instruction of the President.William W. Phelps proposed to the Councilto appoint a certain number of Elders to 
 hold public meetings in that section of coun-try as often as should be deemed necessary toteach the disciples how to escape the indigna-tion of their enemies and keep in favor withthose who were friendly disposed and SimeonCarter, John Corrill, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Prattwere appointed by the unanimous voice of theCouncil and congregation to fill the mission.Elder Nathan West preferred charges againstSamuel Brown, High Priest, for teaching contraryto counsel, namely; encouraging the brethrenin practicing gifts (speaking in tongues); in or-daining Sylvester Hulet, High Priest, (without coun-sel) in a clandestine manner; asserting thathe had obtained a witness of the Lord whichwas a promise of performing the same, inreceiving the gift of tongues, which gift he hadnever before received, but afterwards said thathe had been in possession of that gift for thespace of a year; and in seeming to under-value the authority or righteousness of the HighCouncil by charging Elder West not to sayanything that would tend to prejudicetheir minds that they might not judgerighteously. These charges were sustained by thetestimony of Leonard Rich, Charles English, BrotherBruce, Edward Partridge, Hiram Page, Roxa Slade 
 Caleb Baldwin, and Silvester Hulet; and Pres-ident David Whitmer gave the following decisionwhich was sanctioned by the Council.According to testimony and the voice of theHoly Spirit which is in us, we say unto youthat God in his infinite mercy doth yet grantyou a space for repentance, therefore if youconfess all the charges which have been allegedagainst you, to be just and in a spirit thatwe can receive it, then you can stand asa private member in this Church; otherwisewe have no fellowship for you: and also thatthe ordination of Sylvester Hulet by SamuelBrown is illegal and not acknowledged byus to be of God, therefore it is void andof none effect." Brother Brown confessed the char-ges and gave up his licences but retained hismembership. Council adjourned on the eveningof the first of August, but previous to adjourn-ing the council gave the following letter tothe Elders appointed to visit the churches inClay Co. &c.To the Latter Day Saints who have beendriven from the land of their inheritance andalso those who are gathering in the regionsround about in the western boundaries ofMissouri, the High Council established according 
 to the pattern given by our beloved Savior JesusChrist, send greeting:Dear Brethren:—We have appointed ourbeloved brother and companion in tribulation,John Corrill to meet you in the name of theLord Jesus. He in connection with others dulyappointed also, will visit you alternately forthe purpose of instructing you in the necessaryqualifications of the Latter Day Saints: thatthey may be perfected, that the officers andmembers of the body of Christ may becomevery prayerful and very faithful, strictly keep-ing all the commandments and walkingin holiness before the Lord continually. Thatall that mean to have the "destroyer passover them as the children of Israel and notslay them," may live according to the "Wordof Wisdom"; that the Saints by industry, dili-gence and faithfulness and the prayer of faith,may become purified, and enter upon theirinheritance to build up Zion according to theword of the Lord.We are sure if the Saints are very humble,very watchful, and very prayerful, that few willbe deceived by those who have not authorityto teach, or who have not the spirit to teach 
 according to the power of the Holy Ghost, inthe Scriptures, lest any man's blood shouldbe required at your hands, we beseech youas you value the salvation of souls, andare within, to set an example worthy to be fol-lowed by those without the Kingdom of our Godand His Christ, that peace by grace, and bles-sings by righteousness may attend you tillyou are sanctified and redeemed."(Signed) Clay County, August 1st, 1834.About this time I arrived at Kirtland,after a tedious journey in the midst of enemies,mobs, cholera and excessively hot weather, hav-ing parted from those whom I started withon the 9th ult. at different points of the journey.[rest of page blank]

 Mem. to HeetonThe box for Harriet mustbe seal up forthwithI. H ModesittTavern - CleveslandDec 19th 1841 I willford met at thehouse of Joseph Smith the seer this evening to hearPreaching by Elder Kimball he opened by prayerread a chapter in the Book of Mormon & then spokeas he was led by the spirit of God, among other thingshe spoke a parable of the clay in the hands ofthe potter that when it mared in the hands of thepotter it was lade aside to join the next batch & wasa vessel of hishonour but all clay that formed wellin the hands of the potter & was pliable was a vessel ofhonour & thus it was with the human family &still is, all that are pliable in the hands of God &are obediant to the commands of God are vessels of honour & God will receive them &c.(After Sidney Roberts had occupied the meetinga season) Joseph arose & read a chapter in theNew Testiment containing the parable of the vine &its Branches & explained it much to our edifycation, &said "if we kept the commandments of God weshould bring forth fruit & be the friends of God &know what our lord did & he would reveal hissecrets unto us but his servent knew, not what his Lord 
 doeth. Some say Joseph is a fallen prophet becausehe does not bring forth more of the word of the Lordwhy does he not do it, are we able to receive it Nonot one in this room" he then chastised us for ourwickedness & unbelief knowing that whome theLord loveth he chasteneth & scourgeth evry son &daughter whome he receiveth, & if we do not receiveit then are we bastards & not sons. On revelation hesaid a man would command his son to dig potatoesthen saddle his horse but before he done either tell himto do something els, this is all considerd right but themoment the Lord gives a commandment & revokesthat decree & commands sumthing els the prophet isthen considered fallen &c.Because we will not receive chastizment at the hand ofthe prophet or Apostles the Lord chastizes us withsickness & death. Let not any man publish his ownrighteousnes for others can do that for him sooner let himconfess his sins & then he will be forgiven & bring forthmore fruit. When a man is chastised he gets angry &will not endure it. The reason we do not have thesecrets of the Lord revealed unto us is because wedo not keep them but reveal them, what greaterlove hath any man than to lay down his life for his friendthen we should fight for our friend untill we dieElder B. Young arose & said one thing lay with waiton his mind ie that we should be prepared to keep eachcommandment as it came from the Lord by themouth of the prophet, & as the Lord had commandedus to build a temple we should do it spedilyJan 30th Joseph the Seer taught the following principlesthat the God & father of our Lord Jesus Christ wasonce the same as the Son or Holy Ghost but having redeemed a world became the eternal God ofthat world he had a son Jesus Christ who redeemed this earth the same as his father had a world whichmade them equal & the Holy Ghost would dothe same in his turn & so would all the Saints 
 who inherited a SCelestial glory so their wouldbe Gods many & Lords many their were manymansions even 12 from the abode of Devils tothe SCelestial glory All spirits that have bodies havepower over those that have not hence men havepower over Devils &c[rest of page blank]

 in the form of a personage unto man& reaches out his hand unto him & theman takes hold of his hand & feels nosubstance he may know it is Satanfor an angel of God (which is an angelof light) is a Saint with his resurrectedbody & when he appears unto man& offers him his hand & the man feelsa substance when he takes hold of it ashe would in shaking hands with his ne-ighbour he may know it is a Angelof God, & should a Saint appear untoman whose body is not resurrected hewill never offer him his hand for itwould be ^a^gainst the law by which theyare governed & by observing this key wemay detect Satan [ink blot] that he decieve usnot [FIGURE] 
 The following important items & plain& precious principles were delivered untothe Twelve from Joseph in MontroseIoway Territory July 1st 1839Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy& be ready to forgive our brother on the firstintimations of repentance & asking forgiveness,& should we ever forgive our brother or evenour enemy before they repent or ask forgivenessour heavenly father would be equally as mercif-ul unto us. Again let the Twelve & allSaints be willing to confess all their sins& not keep back a part & let the twelvebe humble & not be exalted & beware ofpride & not seek to excell one above anotherbut act for each others good & pray for one &another & honour oveur brother or make 
 honourable mention of his name & notbackbite & devour our brother. Why [won't]not man learn wisdom by precept of this late age of the world where we have such acloud of witnesses & examples before us& not be obliged to learn by sad experiance every thing we know. must the newones that are chosen to fill the placesof those that our fallen of the quorum of theTwelve begin to exalt themselves untillthey exhalt themselves so high that they willeven tumble over & have a great fall& go wallowing through the mud &mire & darkness Judas like to thebuffetings of Satan as several of the quorum of the Twelve have done or will theylearn wisdom & be wise. [##Matthew 27:3-5##] (O God give themwisdom & keep them humble I pray) 
 When the Twelve or any other witnessesstand before the congregations of the earth& they preach in the power & demonstrationof the spirit of God & the people are asstonis[h]ed& confounded at the doctrin & say thatthat man has preached a powerful discoursea great sermon then let that man orthose men take care that they do not asscribe the glory unto themselves but be ca-reful that they are humble & ascribe thepraise & glory to God & the Lamb forit is by the power of the Holy Priesthood& Holy Ghost they have power thus to speak:what art thou O man but dust & painwholm dost thou receive thy power & blessingsbut from God Then O ye Twelve noticethis [FIGURE] key & be wise for Christ sake & yourown so[u]ls sake 
 Ye are not sent out to be taught butto teach. let every word be seasoned withgrace be vigilent be sober, it is a day ofwarning & not of many words. act honestbefore God & man beware of gentilesophestry such as bowing & scraping untomen in whom you have no confidencebe honest open & frank in all your intercourse with mankind.O ye Twelve & all Saints profit by this important Key [FIGURE] that in all your trialstroubles, temptations; afflictions, bonds,imprisionments, & death see to it that youdo not betray heaven, that you do not betrayJesus Christ, that you do not betray yourBrethren, that you do not betray the revelations of God, whether in the Bible Book ofMormon or Doctrins & Covenants or 
 any other that ever was or ever will be given& revealed unto man in this world or thatwhich is to come, yea in all your kicking& floundering see to it that you do not thisthing lest innocent blood be found in yourskirts & you go down to hell. allother sins are not to be compared to sinningagainst the Holy Ghost & poroving a traitorto thy brethren (A final [FIGURE] key deliveredfrom Joseph in the following language.) I willgive you one of the keys of the miysteries ofthe kingdom. It is an eternal principlethat has existed with God for all eternitythat that man who rises up to condemnothers [ink blot] finding fault with the Churchsaying that they are out of the way whilehe himself is righteous, then know assuredly that that man is in the high road 
 to apostacy & if he does not repent willapostitize as God live, the principle is ascorrect as the one that Jesus put forthin saying that that person he who seekethafter a sign is an adulterous person& that principle is ^eternal^ undeviating & firmas the pillars of heaven for whenever yousee a man seeking after a sign you may set it down that he is an adulterousman. [FIGURE]Other important items of doctrins fromJoseph given in Commerce Ill.The pure testimony of the serventsof God in all ages of the world isattended with the Spirit of Revelation& prophecy, or in other words faithcomes by hearing the word of God & the 
 On the doctrin's of faithFaith comes by hearing the wordof God through the testimony of theServents of God that Testimony is alw-ays attended by the spirit of prophecy& revelation.RepentanceIs a thing that cannot be trifled withevery day. Daily transgression & dailyrepentance is not that which is pleasingin the sight of God [FIGURE]BaptismIs a Holy ordinance preparatory tothe reception of the Holy Ghost,; It is thechannel & key by which the Holy Ghostwill be administered. The gift of theHoly Ghost by the laying ofn of hands 
 cannot be recieved through themedium of any other principlethan the principle of righteousnessfor if the proposals are not complyiedwith it is of no use but withdrawsTonguesWere given for the purpose of preach-ing among those whose languageis not understood as on the day of pen-tecost &c, & it is not necessary fortongues to be taught to the Churchparticularly, for any man thathas the Holy Ghost can speak of the thingsof God in his own tongue as wellas to speak in another. for faithcomes not by signs but by hearingthe word of God. [FIGURE] 
 The doctrin of the Resurrection of theDead and Eternal judgment arenecisary to preach among the firstprinciples of the gospel of Jesus Christ.The Doctrin of ElectionSt Paul exhorts us to make our calling& election shure. This is that Sealingpower spoken of by Paul in other placessee ##Ephesians 1:13-14|Ephe 1st 13–14 v## that we may be sealed upunto the day of redemption, this principleought (in its proper place) to be taughtfor God hath not revealed any thing to Josephbut what he will make known untothe Twelve & even the least saintmay know all things as fast as he isable to bear them for the day mustcome when no man need say 
 to his neighbour know ye theLord for all shall know him (whoremain) from the least to the greatestHow is this to be done. it is to be doneby this sealing power & the other comforterspoken of which will be manifest byrevelation. There is two comfortersspoken of, the first comforter is the HolyGhost the same as given on the day ofpentecost & that all Saints receiveafter faith, repentance & baptism.This first comforter or Holy Ghost hasno other affect than pure intelligenceIt is more powerful in expandingthe mind enlightening the understanding& storeing the intellect with presentknowledge of a man who is of the 
 litteral seed of Abram thhan onethat is a gentile though it may nothave half as much visible affect uponthe body for as the Holy Ghost falls upon one of the literal seed of Abram itis came [calm] & serene & his whole soul& and body ownly exercised by the purespirit of Intelligence. While the aff-ect of the Holy Ghost upon a gentile isto purge out the old blood & makehim actually of the seed of AbramThat man that has none of teheBlood of Abram (naturally) musthave a new creation by the Holy Ghostin such a case there may be more of a powerful affect upon the body& visible to the eye than upon an 
 Israelite while the Israelite at firstmight be far before the gentilein pure intelligence. The other comforter spoken off is a subject of greatinterest & perhaps understood by few ofthis generation. [ink change] After a person hath faithin Christ, repents of his sins & is baptized forthe remission of his sins & receives the HolyGhost (by the laying on of hands,) which is the first comforter then let him continueto humble himself before God hungering& thirsting after righteousness & living byevery word of God, & the Lord will soonsay unto him Son thou shalt be exalted,&c. When the Lord has thoroughly proved him& find that the man is determined to servehim at all hazard then the man will find 
 his calling & election made sure thenit will be his privilege to receive the otherComforter which the Lord hath promisedthe Saints as is recorded in the testimony ofSt. [##John 14:12-27|John##] in the XIV ch from the 12 to the 27 versnote the 16-17-18-21:23 verses. Now what is thisother Comforter it is no more or lessthan the Lord Jesus Christ himself &this is the sum & substance of the wholematter that when any man obtains thislast Comforter he will have the personageof Jesus Christ to attend him or appear untohim from time to time & even he willmanifest the father unto him & they willtake up there abode with him & the visionsof the heavens will be opened unto him &the Lord will teach him face to face & 
 he may have a perfect knowledge of the mys-teries of the kingdom of God, & this is thestate & place where the ancient Saints arivedat when they saw such glorious visions, IsaiahEzekiel, John upon the Isle of Patmos, Greece, Stpaul in the third heavens & all the Saints whoheld communion with the generalassembly & church of the first born &c.The spirit of revelation is in connexionwith those blessings. A person may profitby noticeing the first intimations of the spiritof revelation for Instance when you feelpure intelligence flowing unto you itmay give you sudden shak[e]s of Ideasthat by noticing it you may find it fulfi-lled the same day or soon ie those thingsthat were presented unto your minds by the 
 spirit of God will come to pass & thusby learning the spirit of God & understandingit you may grow into the principle ofrevelation untill you become perfectedin Christ Jesus.An EvangelistIs a patriarch even the oldest manof the Blood of Joseph or of the seed ofAbram wharever the Church of Christis esstablished in the earth there shouldbe a patriarch for the benefit of theposterity of the Saints, as it was withJacob in given [giving] his patriarchal blessingunto his sons &c. 
 Revelation given June 22, 1834, Clay County Mo.Verily I say unto you who have assembledtogether that you may learn my will con-cerning the redemption of Zion mineafflicted people. Behold I say unto you,were it not for the transgressions of my peoplespeaking concerning the Church & notindividually they might have been redee-med even now, but behold they have notlearned to be obedient to the thingswhich I require at there hands butare full of all manner of evil and donot impart of their substance asbecometh Saints, (to the poor &afflicted among them) and are notunited according to the union requiredby the Law of the Celestial Kingdom. 
 And Zion cannot be built upunless it is by the principles of theLaw of the Celestial Kingdom, otherwiseI cannot recieve her unto myselfand my people must needs be chasteneduntill they become obedient if itmust needs be by the things whichthey suffer, I speak not concern-ing those who are appointed to lead mypeople who are the first Elders of myChurch for they are not all undercondemnation but I speak con-cerning the Church abroad. their aremany who will say whare is their God, beholdHe will deliver in times of trouble otherw-ise we will not go up unto Zion & willkeep our monies. Therefore in consequence 
 of the transgressions of my people itis expedient in me that mine Eldersshould weight for a little season forthe redemption of Zion that they them-selves may be prepared & that mypeople may be taught more perfe-ctly concerning their duty & haveexperience & know more perfectlyconcerning their duty & the thingswhich I require at their hands &this cannot be brought to passuntill mine Elders are endowed withpower from on High for behold Ihave prepared a great endowment& blessing to be poured out uponthem inasmuch as they are faithful, & continue in humility before me 
 Therefore it is expedient in me thatmine Elders should weight for a littleseason for the redemption of Zionfor behold I do not require at theirhands to fight the battles of Zion foras I have said in a former commandm-ent even so I will fulfill. I will fightyour battles; Behold the destroyerI have already sent forth to destroy& lay waste mine enemies & notmany years hence they shall notbe left to pollute mine heritage &to blaspheme my name upon theland which I have consecrated forthe gathering to gether of my Saints. BeholdI have commanded my Servent Josephto say to the strength of my house, even 
 my wariors my young men & mid-dle aged to gather together for the redemptionof my people & throw down the towers ofmine enemies & scatter th[e]ir watchmenbut the strength of mine house hasnot harkened unto my words, butinasmuch as their are those that haveharkened unto my words, I haveprepared a blessing & an endowmentfor them I have herd their prayers &will eccept their offering & it is expe-dient in me that they should be brought thus far, for a trial of theirfaith, & verily I give unto you thatas many as have come up hither thatcan stay in the regions round about letthem stay, & those that cannot stay who 
 have families in the East, let themstay for a little season inasmuch asmy servent Joseph shall appoint untothem for I will council him conce-rning this matter; and all things whatso-ever he shall appoint unto them shallbe fulfilled & let all my people whodwell in the region round about be veryfaithful & prayerful & humble beforeme & reveal not the things whichI have revealed unto them. Talknot of judgment, boast not of faith,nor of mighty works, but carefullygather together as much in one regionas can be consistantly with the feelingof the people. And behold I will give untoyou favor & grace in their eyes, that 
 you may rest in peace & safetywhilst you are saying unto the peopleexecute judgment & justice for usaccording to law & redress us of ourwrongs. Now behold I say unto youmy friends in this way you may findfavor in the eyes of the people unt-ill the armies of Israel becomevary great & I will soften the heartsof the people as I did the heart ofPhariaoh from time to time untillmy servent Joseph & mine Elderswhom he shall appoint shall have timeto gather the strength of my house &to have some ^sent^ wise men to fulfillthat which I have communicatedconcerning the purchesies of all the 
 lands in Jackson County thatcan be purchased & in the adjoiningcounties round about for it is mywill that their lands should be purchased& after they are purchased that my Saintspossess them according to the law ofConsecration which I have given &after these lands are purchased I willhold the armies of Israel guiltless intaking possession of their own lands& of throwing down the towers of mineenemies that may be upon them & scatt-ering their watchman & avenging meof mine enemies unto the third & fourthgeneration of them hate hate me. Butfinally let my army become verygreat & let it be sanctified before me 
 that it may become fair as the Sun& clear as the Moon & that her banners may be terrible unto all nationsthat the kingdoms of this world maybe constrained to acknowledgethat the kingdom of Zion is in very deedthe kingdom of our God & his Christtherefore let us become subjectunto her laws. Verily I say untoyou it is expedient in me that the firstElders in My Church should recievetheir endowment from on high inmy house which I have commanded to be built unto my name inthe land of Kirtland & let thosecommandments which I have givenconcerning Zion & her law be execu- 
 ted & fulfilled after her redemption;There has been a day of calling butthe time has come for a day of chusing& let those be chosen that are worthy& it shall be manifest unto my serventJoseph by the voice of the Spirit thosewho are chosen & they shall be sanctified & in as much as they follow the council which they receive they shall havepower after many days to accomplishall things appertaining to Zion. And againI say unto you sue for peace not ownly the people that have smitten you but alsoto all people & lift up an ensign of peace& make a proclamation for peace untothe ends of the earth & make proposals for peaceunto those who have smitten you 
 according to the voice of the spirit whichis in you & All things shall work togetherfor your good, & be faithful & behold& lo I am with you even untillthe end even so Amen[FIGURE]Prophecy or Commandment given December 25th AD 1832Verily thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come topass begining at the rebellion ofSouth Carolina which will eventu-ally terminate in the death & miseryof many souls; and the days will comethat war will be poured out uponall Nations begining at this place forbehold the Southern States shall bedivided against the Northern States
