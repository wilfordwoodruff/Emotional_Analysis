I have not answered them and shall not do so till I hear further from you. You understand the whole  situation and can without doubt throw light upon points which appear mysterious to him. If your health would permit, and you had time, I would like you to reply to those parts of his letters which refer to the contract for the emigration.  We have regretted exceedingly to hear of your ill health and the  manner in which you have been afflicted. We were quite disappointed yi^e^sterday morning at not meeting you, as we understood you had recovered sufficiently to gi^e^t around. We hope that your improvement continues, and that you will soon be able to move around as freely as ever.

C.  Dear Brethren:  Your esteemed favor of the 12th. inst. reached me two or three days ago, upon my return from a visit to Manti. Since its receipt I have not had the opportunity of submitting it to the Council, to whom, with myself, you ad- dressed it, and therefore can only write to you my own views upon the subject men- tioned in your letter. All the brethren of the Council, with two or three exceptions, are at Manti.  I agree with you that it is important that every- thing that can be done should be done to prevent anything inimical being inserted in the platform of either parties, particularly in that of the Democractic party. We  shall do what we can through our friends to have the Republican platform kept free from any injurious declaration concerning us. But this is a matter regarding which we do not feel very hopeful, as the party has considered it a duty for a long time to have something to say on every occasion respecting us.  We have been desirous to have the help of Brother Richards in legal matters here and have missi^e^d him considerably, and we telegraphed ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah, May 22, 1888.  Bishop Orson F. Whitney,  Dear Brother:  Your esteemed favor of the 18th. inst., informing me of the progress that you are making in preparing the manuscript of the life of your grandfather, the late President Heber C. Kimball, has been received and perused with in- terest.  I am glad that steps have been taken to prepare  his life. It is one that will be read with profit by all Latter-day Saints and will be encouraging to our young men. Your grandfather was a mighty man in bringing people to a knowledge of the truth, and the Lord crowned his labors with great success. The record of  the labors of the faithful Elders should be preserved in the memories of the people of God.  You mention the names of Brother Moses Thatcher and Brother George Reynolds as two brethren who io^n^ your opinion would be suitable to go through the work with you before it is published. I see no objection to either or both of them; but Brother Moses Thatcher, I scarcely think, is in a position to do anything of this kind at the present time. He is not in the city now and is not likely to be, as there are duties which he has to attend to that will necessarily require his absence for some time. Brother Reynolds is here, and any arrangement that you and he can make to read the manuscript together will be agreeable to me, and any person whom you two decide upon to ENDENTRY This page is blank ENDENTRY to know if he could be spared. Under the circumstances, however, we think it better for him to remain till you close up your business, and your presence at St. Louis as you return will doubtless be of benefit. We have been doing what we could through  other agencies to have the platform kept free from any declaration inimical to us. If P. L. Williams could have his way, however, we should have something very bitter.  The news of the dedication of the Manti Temple you will get through the public journals. Everything up to last accounts was passing off in a most delightful manner there, and the Elders and Saints were having a very en- joyable time. The Temple itself is a very magnificent structure, and its finish is  elegant. It exceeds in the superiority of its finish any building we have ever erect- ed of a public character and will bear the closest scrutiny. The joiner work and painting are exceedingly creditable.  Brother Erastus Snow improved very much after our administration to him about two weeks ago; but during our absence at Manti he had a  relapse, brought on by Dr. Benedict being compelled to be absent himself in attendance upon a very serious case that he had. Since then Brother Snow has not been so well. We visited him last night and administered to him; found him very clear in his mind and full of hope; but his condition physically was very serious. It will require the utmost care in nursing and in managing his case to restore him to usefulness.

SWEETSER and CO. Grav. WEST VIRGINIA LUBRICATING OIL. VOLCANO, WEST VA. As the distance from our wells at West Virginia is long and delays frequent on the Railroads, and in order to facilitate trade and accomodate customers, we have made arrangements with leading merchants in all the larger places in this country and abroad to act as agents for the sale of our product. They will keep a stock on hand and sell at our quotations, adding freight to their places of business. We shall do all we can to pro- tect and facilitate our business relations. Our friends can get the Zero, Sweetser's and  Producer's brands of oil, of the various gravities, from  FOSTER, WALKER and CO., 226 La Salle Street, CHICAGO.    We desire to call your attention to the article of pure, natural West Virginia Oil, produced by us and sold under the above brand.    This oil, when produced, contains considerable earthy matter and water in emulsion. To remove these and at the same time to make the oil of a satisfactory gravity, the oil is put into tanks and subjected to steam heat for about ten days and nights. This causes the oil to become perfectly clean, and at the same time makes it heavier through the expulsion of benzine and other detrimental volatile substances by from one to two degrees or gravity,    We can recommend this oil as a perfect lubricator during the months from March to December in the more Northern latititudes, while in the Southern latititudes not subject to extreme cold, we can ALWAYS recommend it. We guaurantee it to stand a cold test of from ten to thirty degrees Fahrenheit, without becoming too thick to flow readily and always to flow more readily than lard oil, to which it is superoir as a lubricant.    We claim for this oil, First—Freedom from water, grit or any impurity. Second—Lasting qualities, it being superior in this respect to Sperm and Lard Oil. Third—Not gumming or staining working parts of machinery.  Information regarding prices and rates of freight, etc., cheerfully given.  The following out of the railroads using our Oil have kindly permitted us to refer to them regarding the quality of the oil we supply them, viz.:  The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Co. The Boston and Maine Railroad Co. The Union Pacific Railroad Co. The Portland and Rochester Railroad Co. The Rock Island and Pacific R. R. Co. The North-Western Railway Co.  The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy R. R. Co. The Maine Central R. R. Co. The Chicago, Alton and St. Louis R. R. Co. The European and North American Co. The Washington, Alexandria and Richmond R. R. Co. The Inter-Colonial Railroad Co, Canada.  In fact nearly all the Railroads in this country and Europe are using West Virginia Oils.  Respectfully,  STILES and SWEETSER.

Schettler,  Dear Brother:  I have taken it upon myself to write a few lines to our young Elders who went together from Salt Lake upon their first mission to Owen, and I have liked very much the spirit of them.  Mrs. father and Irene made us splendid music. A good deal was said about Cornelius' mission and the other boys. Of course, you are now beginning to make your first mark in the ministry. I have been there before you and I know what it is; though you have the language to learn, which I did not. I went on my first mission without purse or scrip. I went through the wilderness, waded swamps, traveled alone as a priest, and baptized many that I could not confirm. You are a Seventy and can attend to all the ordinances necessary in organizing branches of the Church. I have great hopes in you young men.

Yet I felt it was a great blessing to be an instrument in the hands of God of performing siuch a work. So I look upon you young brethren who are sent now to the nations of the earth to preach the gospel and save the souls of men. No greater or more glorious work could you be called to. Therefore, my dear brother, take hold with all your might. Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer for the Holy Ghost to be with you to give you power to preach the Gospel and give you souls in search of your ministry, and the Lord will hear your prayers and give you power to accomplish a good mission which will be a satisfaction to  yourself and your friends and acceptable unto God who has called you. And this applies not only to yourself, but to every Elder with you, and all who are in the vineyard of the Lord. Therefore, fear not, but labor faithfully to prune the vineyard once more for the last time and prepare the earth for the Son of Man. Avoid all evil, resist all temptations, and the angels of God will be your constant companions.  Give my love and blessing to Prest. Naegle and wife and all the Elders with you.

All the reasons I have given my friends  to think me wavering on this ground have been manifest in a want of a  disposition to oppose Eunice and her husband in their faith I felt it   my duty to give them a hearing as to the reasons they assign'd for pursuing their present course and I must say that there were some things which app- eared quite reasonable in relation to the subject still I did not get light  in mind on the subject sufficient to over ballance or vie with that which                               ENDENTRY and she was enticed by the father of John C.

Naegele, viz. insist frequently and strongly till he would allow her to go out of his home, for he never took her down with him but thin- king she would become his wife, as many of his utterances did show it. Miss Hofmann never thought of such thing and finally got out through her firmness. In the month of October 1887 she became Logan, and, as she was still owning for her emigration, I wrote immediately to Mr. John C. Naegele, to have to pay me for her the sum of $120.00 or $3 per week for the 40 weeks she was in his wife's home, Mrs. Rosalie Zahler N., writing at the same time to Pres. St. George Stake (I join his answer to my letter). I did ask $3 per week because Miss ENDENTRY had established me in my then present faith neither have I since that time felt  any obstrutction in my mind on account of this Doctrine excepting my anxiety to have  my children see with me on this subject. I exspect however that some, if not many  of the Brethren in Burlington some of which may have gone to the Bluffs have  entertained the Idea that I had become a believer in Mr Strang as being call'd to lead  the church from the fact that my husband were of this faith and withal  that I had not formed much acquaintce with them having been confin'd at home for  the most past on account of sickness in the family and I think it not at all unlikely that  such a report has reached the Bluffs long eer this, But I will digress, I wrote to  Father at the Bluffs and coming to Burlington to make a years visit at Son Webster's exspecting to return the next  spring andc, he replied in due season, and congratulated me on my escape from the savage  hordes of the western wilds and warned me in the name of Israels god not to think of  ever returning there again and that if I did so, I would do it at my peril, at the expense of bodily comforts if not of life itself he sent me fifteen Dollars and said if I would act  wisely and stay where I was he would assist me from time to time, he requested me to write  to his father and to tell him that he wanted him to return and come to Richland and tho't if he  would set himself to work and use every effort in his power ^tho't^ that he would be able to acco- mplish the journey and when he should find himself at Br Websters he would then feel that he could with safety send on help to bring him and Mother to Richland  he then adds "if you should ever find yourselfs in the society of your children  at Richland I know" (I don't guess) you will never wish to leave for the R. M. he said, he felt, that he could not with any safety send on Money beyound where I now was to assist his Parents on their Journey to California or if he could do so,  it appreared to him that it would be much like assisting a Man with but one arm who someway wanted to contrive to put a rope around his neck to hang  himself with, he concluded his remarks by saying that if his Father would  not return there was no law either of God or Man that would condemn me for not returning to dwell with him, he gave me a very handsome invitation  to come and make it my home with him, sassuring me that I should never want  for any of the comforts of life so long as he had any thing or was able to labour  he has written me four or five times a year ago the past winter he lost his Daughter Elisabeth which was a great trial to them.

Mrs Stare and Susan have called upon us a  number of times they called soon after I came and Mrs S. gave me a very pressing  invitation to come and spend a day with them ^and^ to take off any Idea of its being  a mere compliment she adds It would seem so good to have a visit with you  I have visited them twice and spent the Day in the most agreeable manner I felt my  self perfectly at home in their society or as with home friends alth'o they are acc- ounted as some of the most Proud and high feeling Ladies that Burlington offer'd Indeed they live in high stile I have also had Letters from Pennett Redman and I can assure you, they give evidence of having been written in the Spirit of the  highest degree of friendship she speaks of my "most precious Letter" (as she terms it) and speaks of the numberless times as it were she calld at the office before she read one from me and that the days seemed to her like weeks so great was her anxiety to hear from me she wished me to write her as often as possible and she would pay the Postage both ways, and remarked that Pennetts Letters contained the most news and were the most interesting of (almost) any she had ever perused But it is not my wish or design to boast of friends or of any particular attention paid me by distinguished persons, my object is simply to contrast the general feelings of former Day friends towards me with those which have been manifested towards me by  relatives and those under their special influence since I came west. But I do not presume to  complain of my living while with you as to provisions andc, for if ^I^ had felt no greater trials than what I exs- perienced from the privations I suffered they would have been small setting aside from instances in  which a bad feeling was manifested towards me by yourself Son Wilford, whoever might have been the cause of it—once in particular when I took it upon me to go in the room and in behalf of your honored Father to ask for somthing ^to^ eat as he felt backward about going and you hesitated about it saying every thing fell upon you to do, andc, and when I replied that I did not know what we should do having nothing  at all to eat you said I know what you can do, you mustn't eat so much—did you concider that  your Parents had but one thing at a time to eat and that a great allowance aught to be made on this account as well as for your having put one of your family join with us, as also, the amount  of the exspression made to me, but you will excuse the length of my remark as I had no  Idea of pat^r^iticularizing on this, I however feel constraind to state to you on this sheet some  things which th'o small in their nature have nevertheless lain with serious weight on  my mind (but as my sheet is already full with croocked marks and blots I must conclude  on another piece I should indeed copy this were not my time for writing so limited and it is for this reason that this sheet contains so great a variety as to the writing having to improve my most  wearied moments in the penning of the same for which I trust you will make allowance  ENDENTRY INDEPENDENCE  MO.

ENDENTRY Alfred Peterson Apl. 29 1895 ENDENTRY There seemed to be from time to time while at the Bluffs conciderable effort exerted to prove me out guilty of something, or somewhat, or of some misdemeanour of conduct but after all I could  not find that there was any thing of a tangible nature or at least so much so as to be productive  of any evil whatever but not so with the things which I have to speak of for indeed some of them  were of weighty consequences for who can deny that a persons reputation and character is not  worth more to them than almost anything else of an earthly nature and now I must say  that I did while at the Bluffs recieve slighly treatment from some very respectable sisters  in the church for no other cause than having had an unfavorable account of my person  from those who should have been my friends as it was evident from the particular  attention and kind feelings which they manifested towards me for a time after our first  acquaintance with each other and then becoming so cool, reserved, and distant all at once as  tho they viewed me a different person from they had before and in one or two instances I  had evidences of its being through your instrumentality Phebe that I had this treat- ment, once in particular you acquainted me with a sister, and before we got to our  Journeys end and she treated me very politely indeed but it was not long before I  saw you conversing with her not far from me and it was evident to ^my^ mind that I was the  topic of your conversation from the fact that you both alternately eyed me with a very curious  sort of look and in the conclusion this sister gave me a look exspressive of great disdain and al- th'o she would seem in a measure friendly when I saw her yet never appeared as before this  occurance, and it is a fact that there were a number of some of the most respectable sisters from  whom I recieved a similar coldness of treatment after having been made the recipient of some  of the warmest exspressions of friendship from them, and now I wish to say that it is not my man- ner to complain of any want of attention shown me by respectable persons or any others where I  have had a good acquaintance and no reasons for supposing their minds have been biassed even should I be treated with disrespect in short I am ready in general to put up with that degre of attention and respect which such persons account me as meriting from them but I can never  feel that the course pursued with me while at the Bluffs in regard to these things illegible is  according to godliness or agreeable to the ordinary rules of civility Indeed there were various  other things which were calculated in their nature to give one the worst of feelings especially  where there was a consciousness of not having deviated from the strictest rules of civility and  good behaviour in any othf their conduct as I can with safety say was the case with my- self altho I do not lay claim to perfection in anything, stilI I do profess so much of it as to  be able to avoid any course of conduct which would merit those things to which I allude as for instance Phebes remarking that she did not love Mother Woodruff and never could and that she did  not care whether she was comfortable or not, (as I was credibly informed by a friend) and in  another instance that, she said, she would give most anything if she could love me but enough  of this it makes my heart sick and tho I might perhaps make use of a similar exspression with as  much propriety yet I will only say that I have ever loved and respected Phebe since our first acquain- tance and I do feel a confidence that I ever treated her while on our Journey with all that friendship and good feeling which would be possible for anyone to do, under the same circumstances and I can give  no reason at all why I should not have enjoyed the good feelings and confidence of the more  respectable, as formerly while at the east except it were in those things I have named and  my being a stranger there. But I would like to communicate to you some of my present  feelings in relation to my returning and going on to the Valley as I exspected when I left,  as to my faith it is the same it ever has been and there has been nothing which has seem'd to block up my way so much in regard to going forward as the fact, if my constitutions having been so broken down by disease as to compel me to the making use of such article of medicine daily in order to be in any measure comfortable which is attended with some  conciderable exspense and thinking that you might not feel yourself able to do this or  might not be willing to be at the exspense of the same for which reason I have been  influenced to accept the solicetations of my children thus far in my calculations to  make it home with them, but tho I should be extremely happy to make Azmon ENDENTRY OFFICE  OF  F.

I am a believer in the  principals of the Church of Jesus Christ of  laterday saints, Willing and wishing to obey the  call made on me by the pr^i^estood of God, Yet at  the same time the notification was so long  on the road I had no chance to get ready.  The date on which I received your letter was  Feb 27th 7 P.M. only giving me 3 days to  prepare in as the other 7 days would be taken  up in traveling between here and S. L. City.  Which time would have bin all the time  I would have asked if my business had  bin in a shape to leave but it was not  as I had heard nothing about being calld  before I received the notification My finan- cial affairs are in a mixed condition. For instance I have took a contract to build a  house which is up to the square. I have sold some land which has bin bought of a Mexican  there is some trouble about the deeds of said  land I have obligated myself to pay some  more to a party in S. L. City. Have just  sent a order for some thing to keep house with  as I was expecting to get married about the  1st of Apr.

Logan, Utah, Sept 25th 1895  President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,  Dear Brother: In answer to yours of June  15th, I beg leave to say that my financial con- dition is a serious obstacle in the way of  my going on a mission at this time.  I am in debt, have no regular income, and no  regular employment, and the present prospects are that  I shall have to leave home this winter to find em- ployment. In 1885, I had a similar  call and readily responded; but at that partic- ular time I occupied a position in which  it was considered I was more valuable at  home than abroad. The result was that at the unsolicited request of then President Card  and others I was honorably released.  I only regret that at this time my affairs  are in such shape that I am unable  to respond to the call as I did  in the year 1885. Spiritually my  feelings are now as they were then, if ENDENTRY Croydon May 26 1895  Dear sirs,  In answer to yours of the 15th ult. will try and tell  you my condition.  I am a married man 26 yrs. old and without a home, I have considered well all my known possible chances to procure  the necessary means to go with, and find that it is not consist- ant with my finacial circumstan- ces.  I am now about even with  the world financially and know  of no chances for me to get  money enough by fall  to go with, otherwise I am  willing to go.  Your Brother C. E. Condie  Let him state how much time he  would like in which to get ready to take a mission. We would like  him to go if he has the faith to do so, And he can report to us when  he gets ready. His Bishop should endorse his answer.  J. F. S.  ENDENTRY C. D. Glazier May 28 1895. ENDENTRY C. A. Memmott May 16 1895. ENDENTRY C. A. Glazier May 4 1895.
