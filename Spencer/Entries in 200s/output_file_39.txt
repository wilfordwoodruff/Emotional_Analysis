 Parowan April 22 [18]91  President Wilfod Woodruff  Salt Sake    Dear Bro    I have read Bro  Jensen's reply to his call  to go on a mission. I   would have been pleased if  he could have felt able  to go, as I think it would   have been a great blessing to  him, as he says his health  has not been the best for some  time his liver seemes to  trouble him he is now forty  five years of age left denm-  ark when he was 21 years old    Yours Respet  Chas Adams  Bp

 at all times Oh: for the help that I must  have or I feel just like I cannot stand  the continual persecution that is heaped  on me personally it is ^almost^ a daily perform-  ance & I do not know what to do any more  than I have done. If you can do so with  a fervent spirit and have some you  may choose to be with you and I will try  with my poor self to come by prayer to the  same Father for to k^n^ow the best way to  walk to be His ^obedient^ Child in deed and truth  in all things that I do or say & that I may  mags^nify^ Him continually Oh: for a faith-  fullness on my part and a willing heart to  be obedient to the will of my Heavenly  Father in all things If you can do this  for ^me^ please let me hear from you as ear^l^y as  is convenient.

Woodruff:    I have received  your letter of the 26th of Oct. 1891,  in which I am called as a  missionary to Scandinavia, with  request to prepare for leaving  this city on Nov. 28th or Dec. 5th  next; but I must state that  I am not at present in condi-  tion to accept the call, for the  following reasons:  I have lately  been married, have no home of  my own and am involved in debt  to the amount of some $40000.  Be-  sides I have only been in America  a little over three years and want  to get my citizen's paper before  I go back to my mother country  inasmuch as I till that time  will be subject to the military  laws of Sweden.

 nor pains him in the  least, Brother Ence and  his folks was expecting a   call ^on him to Germany,^ and was quite disap  pointed, when the applica-  tion came for his son  John to go to the United  States, and nothing about  G. Ence going to Germany.  In regard to his son John  going to the United States,  although willing to go, I  think that he is better  adapted for a missionary  to England. If his  father should go to Germa  ny, it would be rather  hard on the famely to  call them both. If a  missionary is needed to  the United States, I would  suggest Brother Adelman  Nebeker.  he is about 29 years  old. He possesses more  manhood and courage than  John H. Ence, while the  latter is a very good   young man, he is bashful  and backward.    These are my views and  ideas, you of course may  judge different and know  what is for the best good  for the progress of the  work of god.    Your brother in the  gosple Paul Poulsen Bp  of Richfield first Ward    P. S. These brethren are all  members of my Ward.

 THE UNIVERSITY OF DESERET    JOHN R. PARK, M.D.,  President.    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, Jan. 9, 1892    Wilford Woodruff,  President of  The Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S.    Dear Sir:    Among the books of  the Deseret University library I have found  very few works on the doctrines or  history of the Latter-day Saints. Though  a complete collection of the books and  pamphlets pertaining to the Mormon  people would be a very valuable  attachment to the library, to pur-  chase them at this time would not  be practicable. I therrefore respectfully  ask whether as President of the Church  you will consider the question of   presenting to the University as a free  contribution such works of the  character described as you may  think proper.    With great respect  G Q Coray  Librarian

 to inform you that I will be ready to start  upon a mission immediately thereafter.  I prefer going then to waiting longer. My  homestead entry will not be completed  for two years, and I think it safer to  go before making final proof.    I have been prospered since accepting  the call, and am now free from all encumbran-  ces.

 Smithfield 29th, 1892.    Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother,  It is with fealings of regret  that I am compelled to answer   yours of the 25 instant as I do.    you stated in your call "if there   was no reasonable obstacle to hinder you   from goeing" I am compelled to   state that, I cannot go for the following  reasons. first when I was 13 years of age   I was left Fatherless and have had to   earn my liveing by days work ever  since. I have a Mother and her 
 family depending upon me and   my younger brother for support.    My sister has been sickly ever since   she was 15 years of age, she has now got   the dropsy and we have to send her to   the Doctor to be treated for the same.  My Grandfather who is blind, he and   his wife are dependeing upon us for   support, and also I have signed  notes to the amount of several   hundred dollars with interest, which   is payable at future dates, and   the money for the same I have   got to earn in the meantime.    I have no property that I could 
 sell, because the little that we have  is what I make our liveing with.  I have been counciled by the   Holy Priesthood to answer your letter  as I do, for it says in the Bible "he that  does not provide for his own house   is worse than an Infidal and has already   denied the faith" It is true I have no   family but I have those depending   on me for support who are not   able to support themselves with other   reasons that I have mentioned heretofore  I could not answer your call otherwise   as I have no way of getting the money   to go with togather with other reasonable

He said After they were driven from Far West  and Joseph Smith the prophet was in Liberty Jail He Wm  Davis went to Liberty to see the prophet while there Mr  Weathers the County Surveyor came to him and said Mr  Davis I want to ask you some questions and I want you to tell  the truth will you do it. He answered I will if I know it Mr Davis  do you not know that there is 300 Mormons lying in ambush near  this town, with the intention of liberating Joseph Smith and his  brethren from Prision. Mr Davis Answered No sir I do not know  that there is one Mormon lying in Ambush in this region. Mr   Davis do you not know that there is 300 Indians lying in ambush  near this town to liberate Joseph Smith. No sir I do not know   that there is an Indian any whare near here Mr Weathers then  said last night all the guard saw three Indians Chiefs dressed in   war rament walk three times around Liberty Jail whare  Mormons are imprisioned and Evry th time they came   aroung [around] they struck their tomakawks into a cedar post and   then they went off towards the forest and when they left there  was a large Bow & Arrow appeared in the Heavens over the  Jail and it shone like silver and the reflection of it cast its   form upon the Jail over the probbats room and that was a   sure sign that there was 300 Indians in Ambush to liberate  the prisioners And Mr Weathers & the guard all believed  this was true if it is correct it is certainly worthy  of a place in the History of the Church
