 nor pains him in theleast, Brother Ence andhis folks was expecting a call ^on him to Germany,^ and was quite disappointed, when the applica-tion came for his sonJohn to go to the UnitedStates, and nothing aboutG. Ence going to Germany.In regard to his son Johngoing to the United States,although willing to go, Ithink that he is betteradapted for a missionaryto England. If hisfather should go to Germany, it would be ratherhard on the famely tocall them both. If amissionary is needed tothe United States, I wouldsuggest Brother AdelmanNebeker.  he is about 29 yearsold. He possesses moremanhood and courage thanJohn H.

C. Hansen.C. J. Larsen Bp.I would give him his time, he canreport sooner, if he finds it convenient. J. F. S.

 sell, because the little that we haveis what I make our liveing with.I have been counciled by the Holy Priesthood to answer your letteras I do, for it says in the Bible "he thatdoes not provide for his own house is worse than an Infidal and has already denied the faith" It is true I have no family but I have those depending on me for support who are not able to support themselves with other reasons that I have mentioned heretoforeI could not answer your call otherwise as I have no way of getting the money to go with togather with other reasonable
