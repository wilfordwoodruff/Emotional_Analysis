But O, fools, slow at heart to believe that God is as able to protect his saints in these last days from the hands of the gentiles as HE was anciently to deliver Israel from the Egyptians Those things are the smallest part of my trials &amp; suspens that is resting upon my mind at this time. My trials are as great about these days as at any time since I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. If any inquires what my trials are, should they ask if I was doubting the cause in which I am ingaged, I can answer in truth NO, God forbid. I never was a stronger Mormon Saint than about these days. What is the matter then, I'll" tell you: The Lord has commanded me to go to Zion spedily &amp; while I am setting myself myself about it the devel with all his agents are using their combined exertions &amp; power to hinder me. I have been waiting for the saints from the Islands of the sea to accompany them to that land untill it is vary late, the fall rains are upon us, cold weather will soon encircle us, the minds of the saints are depressed &amp; cast down around me, we have a dreary journey of two thousands miles before us with no other expectation but to camp upon the ground I have a sick wife whose spirits at times are much depressed under such  is great consolation to my soul. The above are some of the trials that are resting upon me. But I can say get thee behind me Satan for I say in the name of Jesus Christ that I will stand in the land whare God has commanded me to gather unto before another spring rolls over my head if it is on foot &amp; alone &amp; I beg my bread by the way. So now rage on thou foul monster untill thou art stoped in thy mad career at the end of thy chain given thee by the angel of God &amp; see who will gain the victory.

But I have encouraged him from day to day; as we must walk by faith not by sight, untill he is now preparing him -self &amp; family to go, may the Lord bless him. We must all have our faith tried before we are prepared for a celestial kingdom &amp; "faith without works is dead being alone." I do not know when my faith will begin to be tried if it has not already been esspecially of late, But I thank the LORD that HE has thus far enabled me to keep the faith &amp; withs- -tand every opposition. I desire to be humble unto the end. I spent the night at Phebe appears resign -ed to the will of the Lord in all her troubles &amp; tribulations.

Brother Asahel was a young man of the most brilliant talents, firm &amp; independant in independant in his principles. I had not been privileged with a personal interview with him for about seven years but had corresponded together by letter. Asahel had a peculiar art in letter writing which gave much interest to all the productions of his pen.

Farewell Asahel farewell. No more will thy voice the ears of thy friends salute or thy pen their hearts unlock, while here in time, truth unsuled before the now are living realities, while Willford's testi- mony to thee in its true light can now be weighed.
