Yes PHEBE possesses to much firmness, and faith in God and confidence in God to put her hand to the plough and look back or to wholey give way to such trials and any other however great. She is determined, like Ruth, to forsake her kindred and country for Christ's sake and my own and the cause in which she is ingaged, and as I behold this principle beaming in her daily walk, heart and countenance it binds my whole soul to her in love stronger than death or the bars of a castle, yes that love that none partakes of except those in like circumstances, and that man that will not love his wife with all his heart after she has made such a sacrifice for his sake is not worthy of a companion or a standing in human society. And O ye ungodly gentiles that would laugh at a man for considering such a wife the greatest temporal blessing that heaven could bestow ye are more fit for the society of Demons than a virtuous woman. The devel has never tempted me to scease from doing the will of God by gathering to Zion or to scease travling and preaching the gospel, by prese nting before my my friends and telling me to stay and enjoy their society for in doing thus I might ruing both myself and friends I would sooner say to him get thee behind me satan for I would go to the land of Zion or where ever God sent if I had to forsake as many fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters as could stand between Maine and Mother Carter with all the Brothers and sisters appertaining to the household, have been uncommonly attentive, kind, and generous to us both during the last year that we have been with them, although they do not see the propriety of our gathering with the Saints to Zion in order to escape the judgments of God, yet my prayer to God is that they may not loose their reward for their uncommon kindness towards us but may yet have their eyes open to understand the commandments of God concerning Zion in the last days and flee unto it for reffuge themselves and obtain a righteous inheritance there while the judgments of God are resting upon the gentiles and may they also have part in the first resurrection and finally obtain a celestial glory which is my prayer through JESUS CHRIST   ENDENTRY September 12, 1838 ~ Wednesday   Sept 12th I spent the day at father Carters in packing up the last remains of our goods I carried the most of our goods to Sister Sarah Foss's whare the saints or camp will spend the night when they arive.

But none of these things moove me I am determined to overcome, keep the faith and go to Zion   ENDENTRY September 25, 1838 ~ Tuesday   Sept 25. O Lord give me faith, grace, and patience to endure what is lade upon ^me^ without murmering or complaining, help me to be resigned to thy will in all things. The report that I spoke of yesterday concerning the Mormon's in Mo as the saints are called, is going the rounds today among our friends and neighbo -urs; this one is saying it wont do to go and that is saying it will not do to go for you will be killed andc. But O, fools, slow at heart to believe that God is as able to protect his saints in these last days from the hands of the gentiles as HE was anciently to deliver Israel from the Egyptians Those things are the smallest part of my trials and suspens that is resting upon my mind at this time. My trials are as great about these days as at any time since I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. If any inquires what my trials are, should they ask if I was doubting the cause in which I am ingaged, I can answer in truth NO, God forbid. I never was a stronger Mormon Saint than about these days. What is the matter then, I'll" tell you: The Lord has commanded me to go to Zion spedily and while I am setting myself myself about it the devel with all his agents are using their combined exertions and power to hinder me. I have been waiting for the saints from the Islands of the sea to accompany them to that land untill it is vary late, the fall rains are upon us, cold weather will soon encircle us, the minds of the saints are depressed and cast down around me, we have a dreary journey of two thousands miles before us with no other expectation but to camp upon the ground I have a sick wife whose spirits at times are much depressed under such illegible ^severe^ trials But thank God she stands the shock like a brave soldier which is great consolation to my soul. The above are some of the trials that are resting upon me. But I can say get thee behind me Satan for I say in the name of Jesus Christ that I will stand in the land whare God has commanded me to gather unto before another spring rolls over my head if it is on foot and alone and I beg my bread by the way. So now rage on thou foul monster untill thou art stoped in thy mad career at the end of thy chain given thee by the angel of God and see who will gain the victory. I spent the day at father Carters gathering apples I saved some apple seeds from his orcherd to plant in Zion   ENDENTRY September 26, 1838 ~ Wednesday   Sept 26th I rode to Elder William Harmon {for Sister Sarah Foss} and drew it to sister Sarah Foss's Elder Townsend returned with me distance of the day 20 m    ENDENTRY September 27, 1838 ~ Thursday   27th It is a dark cold rainy day and gloomy also, and what makes it more so the Camp of the Saints do not get a long from the east yet, and I have not herd any thing from them for several days. But may the Lord give me patience that I may be resigned in all things. Notwithstanding the cold rain I harnessed up my horse and carri ed Brother Townsend home, and assisted him in packing up his houshold goods to the amount of about 600 lbs I took the goods in my waggon and carried them to Sister Sarah Foss's house that we might be ready when the camp came along: Elder Townsend has been cast down in his mind for several days and could scarcely get faith enough to prepare himself and family to start for Zion thinking the way did not look as clear and bright as he wished to see it. But I have encouraged him from day to day; as we must walk by faith not by sight, untill he is now preparing him -self and family to go, may the Lord bless him. We must all have our faith tried before we are prepared for a celestial kingdom and "faith without works is dead being alone." I do not know when my faith will begin to be tried if it has not already been esspecially of late, But I thank the LORD that HE has thus far enabled me to keep the faith and withs- -tand every opposition. I desire to be humble unto the end. I spent the night at Phebe appears resign -ed to the will of the Lord in all her troubles and tribulations. It is great consolation to my soul to see her determined to maintain her integrity unto the end. How good it is to have a help meet in every time of need.

It was for a moment a trial to my feelings to take my tender infant at her breast into a cold tent to sleep upon the ground but after we became reconciled to it there was a door opened for her to go into a house to spend the night and as she had a young child she excepted the invitation.

It was with difficulty that we could get entertain ment in the city for the night but finally we obtained an empty house and went into it and spent the night. Distance 27   ENDENTRY FIGURE ASAHEL H. WOODRUFF DIED at Terre Haute I.a. Oct 18th 1838 AGED 24 Years  And is he gone, has asahel fled away, from lif's fair scenes to the regions of the DEAD Yes he is gone by deaths relentless hand. Had youth, or beauty, friends or virtue, power to save He now might be mingling with his friends, and not sleeping in the silent GRAVE  There is nothing calculated to sooner lead the mind to serious and solumn meditations and to bring fresh to our memory the events of our past lives than to visit the tomb of those that are made dear to us by the ties of nature, of friendship, or of the blood of CHRIST. Brother Asahel was a young man of the most brilliant talents, firm and independant in independant in his principles. I had not been privileged with a personal interview with him for about seven years but had corresponded together by letter. Asahel had a peculiar art in letter writing which gave much interest to all the productions of his pen. We both had long anticipated much upon an interview with each other but my hopes were suddenly blasted. I did not hear of his death untill the day previous to my arival at his dwelling. But I say the will of the Lord be done all is right I feel resigned   ENDENTRY O death thy stroke is sure. At an early hour thy victim's fallen, and blasted the fond hopes of a father a sister. Eunice be still and know that GOD hath spoken, and thy Brother called. Asahel lived for thee: for thee he plan'd, he toiled, and hoped, and airy castles built for thy future joy, but now he's gone. His grave remains to be wattered ownly by the Dews of hea- ven unless upon the Wabash banks a friend should chan- ce to roam and drop an accidental tear. O Asahel among strangers thy lot was cast among them thou hast fallen and found a grave. No friend to see thy grief or share thy joy or drop a tear with thee. Willford and Phebe alone marked thy silent bed and ownly could take a pebble in memory of thy noble soul. A pebble did I say, ah thy books, thy Journals, thy letters, and all the productions of thy pen, are standing monuments of thy worth and of more value to thy friends than the gold of Opher or the rubies of Peru. In the morn of thy days thou hast fallen yet the events of thy youth will be active in the memory of thy friends while memory lives Methinks the spirit steals across my breast and says be still and learn to be resigned and feel that with thy brother all is well that what was not accomplished with him in time, will be finished when COLOB'S walls he stands clothed with   Immortality. God is just, all is right. In the morn of his days Asahel is called from the scenes of time that his noble soul may see, feel, and view those glories which are hid behind the vale the covering of eternity. Farewell Asahel farewell. No more will thy voice the ears of thy friends salute or thy pen their hearts unlock, while here in time, truth unsuled before the now are living realities, while Willford's testi- mony to thee in its true light can now be weighed. Upon thee nature hath bestowed her bounty but not in vain though buried from human view, then sleep untill the trump shall sound to call thee forth in eternal things to act. Eunice dry thy startling tear and give thy brother up. The Lord hath taken him to save his soul that earthly snares should not his feet enwrap and his fall secure. It speaks in language loud be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh. How solumn to part with friends yet it sweetens death to know our friend is God and the rest of saints our home. Then sleep Asahel sleep let naught thy dust disturd untill rean imated by the Arkangels trump and in immortals gate to meet thy friends and walk in paths of eternal light and truth and comprehend all knowledge and wisdoms space and natuers laws that ever live in vast DOMAIN   ENDENTRY December 13, 1838 ~ Thursday   Dec 13th This was a solemn Day to me. I spent most of the day in inquiring into and attending to the business and affairs of Brother Martin Ray the administrator and clerk of Brother Asahel informed me that Brother Asahel Died at 3 oclock in the morning on the 18th of Oct 1838 and that he was sick 10 days and deprived of his reason 4 days before his death. his mind while delireous was principly upon his business but occasionally spoke of his friends. His disease was the congestive fever on the brain Martin Ray had been in his employ two months was with him through all his sickness and death they informed me that they considered him some absent minded or his mind deeply exercised upon some subject unbeknown to them for several months before his death. they were not as well acquainted with this matter as I was myself for I was intimately corresponding with him by letter and I know from his communications that his mind was deeply interested in the subject of the gospel of Jesus Christ or the fulness of it and the cause of the church of Latter Day Saints. They also informed me that he was moral in his life temperat in practice Beloved and honoured as a citizen and his loss deeply felt. His entire stock of Books with all personal property was sold at the Administrator sale on the 4th of Dec amounting to about $3000 dollars. All of his private letters, Journals, writing, papers account Books and his pocket watch, penknife, pencil, letter stamp, bosom pin, silver thimble, and some other small things were reserved and I took them into my possession to preserve for his Sister and friends untill I can have an opportunity to convey them unto them. While looking over Asahels letters I found all that I sent him carefully filed with other communications from his friends After attending to the above affairs I visited my Brother grave FIGURE A.H.W. accompanied ownly by my wife and Mr Ray I viewed it, and it looked lonely indeed. I never more fully sensed the vanity of earth and the impropriety of trusting to the honours of this world for happiness than on this occasion I took some pebbles from his grave in memory of the spot and retired with this peculiar reflection resting upon my mind That I had paid my last visit to my eldest Brother without spending a night beneath his roof That I had paid my last visit to my youngest Brother and ownly permitted to view his GRAVE I returned to his Book store and wrote a Letter to our Parents in Farmington Con FIGURE giving an account of Asahels Death andc.

Opened on the 21 day of Oct 1813 The subscription commenced for this purpose  on the 15 Nov 1805 and finished the same year  amounting to about £9000. The first stone was  laid on the 15 July 1812. The whole of the  design was Planned by Mathew Charles Wyatt  Esqr ^R. A^ of London. The monument which is  in Bronze was executed by Richard Westmacott  Esqr. R. A. London; the Pedestal of hendal Marble  by Messrs Hetherington and Webster of this town.   Description of the Monument  The figures which constitute the principal design are  Nelson, victory, Death, his country mourning  for her loss, and her navy eager to avenge it,  naturally claim a place in the Group. The principal  figure is the Admiral, who resting one foot on  a conquered enemy and the other on a cannon  with an eye stedfast and upraised to victory  is recieving from her a fourth Naval crown upon  his sword which to indicate the loss of his   ENDENTRY right arm, is held in his left hand. The loss of  his right arm is concealed by the Flag which  the Genius of victory is lowering to him and under  the folds of which Death lies in ambush for  his victim by which it is indicated that he  recieved the reward of victory and the stroke of  Death at the same time. By the figure of an enraged  british seaman is represented the zeal of the  navy to revenge the loss of its most gallant leader Brittanna in the back ground with laurels in her  hand and leaning regardless of them on her  spear and shield describing the feelings of  the country fluctuating between the pride  and anguish of a triumph so dearly purchased.    Description of the Pedestial  Round the uper part of the moulding are inscribed  Lord Nelson's ever memorable and to be revered words  "England expects evry man to do his duty"  At the bose base of the Pedestal are four figures, in  chains, as captives emblematic of the four peculiarly  great victories he achieved. The space between  these figures on the sides of the Pedestal are  filled by four grand Bass reliefs, executed in  Bronze representing the four glorious victories    viz St. Vincent 14th Febuary 1797  Nile 1st August 1798     Copenhagen 2nd of April 1801 Trafalgar 21 of October 1805     Dimentions of the Monument  Hight of the outward Plinth on which the rails stand 1 ft 6 in  Pedestial 8— 10—  Monument 14 2   ENDENTRY Total Height  24 ft 6 in Circumference of outward Plinth 95— 4  Pedestial 58— 0   The figures are all of the proportions of 7 feet   The weight of bronze of which the Monument  is composed is estimated at upwards of 22 tons   Lord Nelson was born the 29th of September 1758   The whole range of buildings called the  exchange cost £110848 Pounds Flaging cost £36000 Pounds Town Hall cast £156000 Pounds   After visiting this monument we went  through several of the most splendid streets in the city and returned 6 miles   13th FIGURE I recieved 2 letters and wrote one  at 2 oclok in the afternoon I took the  Steemer Comodore for Glasgow Scotland It was a cold day we took cabin Passage their wer four of us viz R Hedlock John Banks and myself fare was 17/ each and meals extra Elder Hedlock and myself went to bed.
