 counsel you as you please dont turn round and oppose them.I want every man before he enters into acovenant to know what he is going to do; but we want to knowif this people is going to support the Priesthood. In the nameof Israel's God if you say you will, do so.We want men appointed to take charge ofthe business that did lay on the shoulders of Joseph. Letme say to you that this Kingdom will spread more than everThe Twelve have the power now the Seventies the Elders andall of you can have power to go and build up the Kingdomin the name of Israel's God.Nauvoo will not hold all the people who will come into the Kingdom. We want to build the Templeso as to get our endowment and if we do our best and Satanwill not let us build it we will go into the wilderness andwe will receive the endowment for we will receive anendowment anyhow.Will you abide our counsel? I againsay my soul for any man's if they will abide our counselthat they will go right into heaven. We have all the signsand tokens to give to the porter at the door and he will let usin.I ask you as quorums do you want BroRigdon to stand forward as your leader your guide yourspokesman. President Rigdon wants me to bring upthe other question first and that is does the Church want andis it their ownly desire to sustain the Twelve as the First Presidencyof this people?Here are the Apostles the Bible the Book ofMormon the Doctrine and Covenants they are written on thetablet of my heart. If the Church want the Twelve to stand as the head—the First Presidency of the Church and atthe head of this kingdom in all the world stand next to Joseph

 walk up unto their calling and hold the keys of this kingdom every manevery woman every quorum is now put in order and you are now thesole controllers of it.All who are in favour of this in all the congregation ofthe Saints manifest it by holding up the right hand. There was a universal vote. If there are any of the contrary mind—every man and every woman who does not want the Twelve to presidelift up your hands in like manner. No hands up. Thissupersedes the other question and trying it by quorums.We feel as though we could take brotherRigdon in our bosom along with us. We want such men asbrother Rigdon. He has been sent away by brother Joseph tobuild up a Kingdom. Let him keep the instructions andcalling; let him raise up a mighty kingdom in Pittsburgand we will lift up his hands to Almighty God. I thinkwe may have a printing office and a gathering there. Ifthe devil still trys to kill us he will have enough to do.The next is President Marks. Our feelingis to let him stand as President of the Stake as heretoforeWe can build the Temple &c.You did not know who you had amongstyou. Joseph so loved this people that he gave his life forthem. Hyrum loved his brother and this people unto deathJoseph and Hyrum hasve given their lives for the Church.But very few knew Joseph's character. He loved you unto death. You did not know it until after his death. He hasnow sealed his testimony with his blood.If the Twelve had been here we wouldnot have seen him given up. He should not have been given up. He was in your midst but you did not know himHe has been taken away for the people are not worthy ofhim.The world is wide. I can preach in England

 Ireland Scotland France Germany &c; I can preach in all the world andthe devils cannot find us. I will sware to you I will not be given up.There is much to be done. You have men among you who sleep with one eye open. The foundationis laid by our Prophet and we will build thereon. No otherfoundation can be laid but that which is laid and we willhave our endowment if the Lord will.As the authorities do not want us to domilitary duty dont do it. If it is necessary my kneckis ready for the knife. As for myself I am determinedto build up the Kingdom of God and by the bye there willbe a gleaning of grapes and it may be said "to your tentsO Israel."We can build on the foundation whichwas laid by the Prophet. Joseph has finished his workand all the Devils in hell and all the mobers on earth couldnot take his life until he had accomplished his work. Godsaid I will put a veil over his eyes and lead him upto the slaughter like a sheep to be killed for the peopleare not worthy of him though God loves this people.Let no man suppose that the Kingdomis rent from you that it is not organized. If all the quorums ofthe Church were slain except the High Priest they would rise upwith the keys of the Kingdom and have the power of the Priesthoodupon them and build up the Kingdom and the devil cannothelp himself.You can go to a healthy country buy the landand dont let a cursed scoundrel get in your midst.

 increasing in greatness perfectly free from these poor devils we should feelbetter than we do now. Let us all be humble and get our endowmentsall be humble industrious and prudent what sort of a kingdom would itbe? The foundation is laid for more than we can think or talkabout to day.Is it the will of this congregation that they willbe theth^ tithed^ until the Temple is finished as they have heretofore been?If so signify it by the uplifted hand—[The vote was unanimous]—The men will act who never acted beforeand they will have the power and authority to do it. Is it theminds of the congregation to loose the hands of the Twelve andenable us to go and preach to all the world? We want to knowthe feelings of the people. Is it your will to support the Twelvein all the world in their missions.—[The congregation susttainedthis question by a unanimous vote]— Will you leave it tothe Twelve to dictate about the finances of the Church and willit be the mind of this people that the Twelve teach what willbe the duties of the Bishops in hand ling the affairs of theChurch. Iwant this because Twelve men can do it just aswell as calling this immense congregation together at any othertime —[A unanimous vote]—We shall have a Patriarch and theright is in the family of Joseph Smith—his brothers his sonsor some ones of his relations. Here is Uncle John he hasbeen ordained a Patriarch. Brother Samuel would havetaken the office had he been alive. It would have beenhis right. The right is in Uncle John or one of his brothers—[read Doctrine and Covenants sec III Par 17]— I know that it wouldhave belonged to Samuel but as it is if you leave it to theTwelve they will wait until they know who is the manWill you leave it to the Twelve and they dictate in thematter —[unanimous vote]— I know it will be let alone for thepresent. 
 I feel to bring up brother Rigdon. We are ofone mind with him and he with us. Will this congregation upholdhim in the place he occupies by the prayer of faith and let himbe one with us and we with him --[unanimous]-- The Twelve will dictate and see to other matters. There will be a committeefor the Temple and now let men stand to their posts andbe faithful".The Conference adjourned to Oct. the 6th withthe Benediction from Elder Parley P. Pratt.The next day I attended a council and weappointed two Trustees in Trust for the Church--namely George Millerand N. K.

It wasmy mind in the first place that we should have suitable timeto meditate upon all matters and weigh them even every subjectwherin we felt interested. When the question was asked me if 
 they should continue to baptize for the dead I said I had no counsel togive upon that subject at present but should think it not best to attendto it at that timeI have learned some things I did not knowwhen I came home. I discover a disposition in the sheep toscatter abroad now the Shepherd is taken away. I do not saythat it will never be right for this people to go from here or scatterabroad but let them wait until the time comes and until theyget counsel to do so.The report has gone through the city that the Twelve have secret understanding with those menwho are going away and taking companies with them thatthey shall take all they can and that although the Twelve willblow it up yet privately they wish it to go on but if it wasthe last words I had to say before going into the eternal worldI would sware by the Holy Trinity that it is utterly false andand not one word of truth in it. There is no man who has anyright to lead away one soul out of this city by the consent of theTwelve except Lyman Wight and George Miller who have hadthe privilege of taking the Pine Company where they pleasedbut not another soul has the consent of the Twelve to gowith them.There is no man who has any libertyto lead away people into the wilderness from this Church orto lead them anywhere else by the consent of the Twelve or theChurch except the case above named and I tell you in thename of Jesus Christ that if Lyman Wight and George Millertake a course contrary to our counsel and will not act inconcert with us they will be damned and go to distructionIf men will not stop striving to be great and exalted andlead away parties from us and striving to weaken ourhands they will fall and not rise again and I will destroytheir influence in this Church with the help of God and 
 my brethren. I wish you to distinctly understand that the counsel ofthe Twelve is for every family that does not belong to the Pine Company to stay here in Nauvoo build up the Temple and get their endowment.Dont scatter. United we stand divided we fall.It has been whispered about that all who gointo the wilderness with Wight and Miller will get their endowmentbut they cannot give an endowment in the wilderness. If wedo not carry out the plan laid down by Joseph and the patternhe has given for us to work by we cannot get any furtherendowment. I want it to sink deep into your hearts thatyou may remember it. I repeat it. Let me reason with youIf you stir up the flame of dissent will you get an endowment? No.You get a party to run here and another there and divide our strengthand weaken our hands and we shall be left and our enemies will flockaround us and destroy us. In that case you will not get yourendowment but will sink and not rise—go to hell and not to the bosomof Abraham.Do the people leave here because they areaffraid? Do you fear those who have power to kill the bodyIf you leave this place for fear of mob before God tell you to goyou will have no place of rest but you will flee from place toplace and go like the Jews until God raises up some otherpeople to redeem you for if the Devil scares you from thisplace he will scare you from all other places.Let no man go from this place but thePine Company brethren but stay here sow plant & build. Put in yourplowshares into the praries. One plowshare will do more todrive off the mob than two guns. Let us stay herewhere the bones of Joseph and Hyrum Samuel Don Carlosand Father Smith are. Joseph has said if I am slainin battle or fall in any way I want my body laid inNauvoo. I had rather have the dead body of the Prophetthan some men who are alive and I should rather havethe clothes of the Prophet stuffed with straw for President 
 of the United States than any man whose name is now beforethe nation for a candidate for he would not do as much harm We want to build the Temple in this place. If we have to build it as the Jews built the walls of the Temple in Jerusalemwith a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. Howeasily some men are scared. I have never been frightenedyet and I know other men who have not.Do you suppose the mouth of God is closed to be opened no more unto us. If this was so Iwould not give the ashes of a rie straw for the Salvationof the Church. If God has ceased to speak by theHoly Ghost or revelation there is no salvation; but this is notthe case.There seems to be a disposition manifestedby many to leave Nauvoo and go into the wilderness orsomewhere else. But what if we should go into thewilderness and we should ask God to give us anendowment and he should ask us if we were driven from Nauvoo and who drove us. The Devildrove us would be the answer. "Well" he might say "did you not know that I had power over thedevil" Yes; but one said "I would not give a Jackknife for all Nauvoo and another said I would notgive a pair of mules for the best farm in Hancock County& I was affraid.Would the Lord give an endowment to a people who was frightened away from their dutyThese who are wishing to lead away parties contrary to counselI would not wish them damned worse than to have a companyafter their own likeing for they will soon quaral amongthemselves.If we should go into the wildernessand ask the Lord to give us an endowment he might askus saying "Did I not give you rock in Nauvoo to 
 build the Temple with?""Yes.""Did I not through my Providence furnish men to quaryand cut the stone and prepare it for the building""Yes.""Did I not give you means to build the Temple there?"Yes.""Very well, had you died in Nauvoo on the wallsof the Temple or in your fields I would have taken you to myself and raised up men to officiate for you and you wouldhave enjoyed the highest glory. Did you make asacrifice by tithing?"No""Well I dont wonder you did not believe I had power over the devil."Such may go away. But I want to havethe faithful stay here and settle this city. We shall require thetruth of all your property as the tithing for the building of the Templesfor the poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and living bythe Church hereafter so that I can give my whole time to thebusiness of the Church. I have always supported myself heretoforein all my travels and labours.While in England in one year we circulated 60,000tracts upon our doctrine. This ought to be done in all the world andit can be where the Elders are faithful to their calling.Joseph the Testator has been preserved tillnow but he has now sealed his testimony with his blood and his testamentshould be put in force. While the Testator lived it was all in his ownhands but now he is dead.There is no remission of sins without the shedingof blood. You will soon wake up and know things as they areThere has been a great debt paid. There will be no need of moreblood of the Saints being shed at present. By and by you will 
 understand and see that all is rightWo! Wo! Wo! unto all who have shed the blood of the Saints and the Lord's Anointed. It must needs be that offencescome but wo unto them by whom they come.To those who want to go away from thisplace I would say wait until the time comes. I will give youthe key. North and South America is Zion and as soon asthe Temple is done and you get your endowment you can go and build up stakes but dont be in haste. Wait until the Lordsays, Go.If you have the Spirit of God you can discernright from wrong. When all is right in the Priesthood and a manrises up and speaks in the Spirit of God and just right all willsay Amen; but when a man rises up and talks as smooth as oil if he is not right there will be many queries about it. It willnot edify the body. I give this as a key.You may go all over North and South America^and build up stakes^ when the time comes. The whole continant of America must beorganized into Districts and Presiding Elders appointed overeach district. The time has come when all things mustbe set in order. I have had these things upon my mind alllong time. The time has come now for bickering to ceaseThere must be a strict order of things and we are no longer boundto harbor blacklegs counterfeiters & bogus makers. We knowall about them. They have been in our midst long enough. Iadvise all the Saints to have no dealing with such men. Letthem alone. The time has come that they should be whipedout of our midst. Let those men alone—let the ungodlydealers alone. And as to the Doctors who are in our midstwho are our enemies I would say let them alone also for I haveno doubt that three to one who have died in this place had adoctor.And I would say wo unto you lawyers 
 for your whole study is to put down truth and put a lie in its stead. I wantthe lawyers to know that we have common sense. They want to makeyou believe that when you spell baker you mean cider or wiskeyNow let the Doctors and Lawyers alone and leave off bitterness andevil speaking and you will build the Temple and get an endowmentAll you lawyers go away and let us alone and when we get full of thedevil and want you we will send for you. We may then have amore convenient season.I want to say to the Saints do not harbourblacklegs counterfeiters & bogus makers. Wipe them away. It is timeto carry out the design of our Prophet. Do cease to employ doctorslawyers and merchants who will use your purse and then mobyou. Store your grain in Nauvoo for you will want itthere to eat while you are building the Temple.I want to say to the hands upon the Templebe united and to the Committee I would say dont turn away anyperson because he is an Englishman Scotchman Irishman or any othernation but employ every man you can and build the Temple andyour homes.I would rather pay out every cent to build upthis place and get an endowment even if I was driven the next minutewithout anything to take with me.As to the doctors let them go. I can provethat a doctor in this place doctored a woman who was in the family wayand he did not know it until she was delivered and both the womanand child died and if you employ them you will all die; but thetime has come when you neead no longer support them.There is a distinction between the law ofthe land and the law of the Church. You have the privilege ofkeeping all shops that does not come in contact with the law of thethe State County or City so I will evade the law says the dealerand give away wiskey and sell a little tobaco or something elseand charge enough for both but the law of the Church will reach 
 such men if they are members for they will be cut off.I had a dream which I will here relate. I saw a fruit tree and I went into the tree to search for fruit. Isoon descovered that some of the main branches on the top growingfrom the main body was dead. It seamed necessary to cutoff the dead branches in order to save the tree. So I toldsome person to help me cut them off and he steped on to a largegreen limb. They were affraid it would break so I put my shoulder under it and held it up while he cut off the deadbranches. It cracked the green limb but it did not breakAfter we cut off the dead branches the wounds healed up andthe tree grew finely.Now let us cut off the dead branchesof the Church that good fruit may grow and the voice willsoon be heard go and build Zion and the great Temple of the Lord.A word unto the Seventies. They willbe organized into their different quorums and a presidency ofof seven men will be chosen out of the first Seventy to presideover each quorum.Now as you have been warned let every man warn his neighbour and we will give every manhis appointment as soon as convenient.May the Lord bless you in the nameof Jesus Christ Amen.In the afternoon the assembly was againaddressed in a simlar strain by Heber C. Kimball andPresident Young but I was at home writing and hencedid not take notes; and in the evening in company withMrs Woodruff I rode out to bro John Benbows and spent thenight. We came to the conclusion to leave our only sonWilford with brother and Sister Benbow while I took 
 my mission to England accompanied by my wifeReturning the next day I met in Council with the TwelveWe conversed concerning the route we should take and it was thought thatthe northern route would be the healthiest. Among other things somedreams were rehearsed. The following was told by myself:"I met with Joseph Smith in the congregationof the Saints. He had his old Hebrew and German Bible and preachedto the Saints but he seamed to be too thronged by the people and herose up lifted up a curtain and passed into another room where thepeople could not disturb him and there he was going to teachthe people.The following is from the hand of BrighamYoung:Certificate [Figure]"I hereby certify that Elder Wilford Woodruff has receiveda mission by order of the quorum of the Twelve to England topreside over the Churches in that land and I feel to bless himin the name of the Lord with all belonging to or dwellingbeneath his roof at this time consisting of his wife andchildren and sister Mary who is assisting themto get on their journey.Brigham YoungOn the 23rd I visited Emma Smith thewidow of the Prophet. She let me have a piece of oakfor a staff out of the coffin of the martyred Joseph. Shealso let me have a pair of white cotton gloves and  Mrs. Woodruff apocket ^cotton^ handkerchief both of which were woren ^worn^ by the Prophet whilelivingWe called upon Sister Mary Smith widowof Hyrum the Patriarch and she gave us some hair from 
 the heads of Joseph, Hyrum Samuel and Don Carlos Smith allbrothers and the same parents. I also obtained some hair of thequorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My intention in obtaining the hair was thatI might put a portion of each in the knob of my staff as a relickof those noble men—the master Spirits of the nineteenth century.I next visited Mother Lucy Smith theparent of Joseph—the Lord's Anointed—and of Hyrum Samueland Don Carlos, and the wife of Joseph the First Patriarch ofthe last dispensation all of whom directly or indirectly fell martyrsfor the cause of God. The old Mother and Prophetess feltmost heart broken at the loss of her children and from the wickedand cruel treatment she had received from the hands of theworld. She beged a blessing at my hand. I laid myhands upon her head and by the Spirit of God proclaimedthe followingBlessingofMother Lucy Smithunder the hands of Wilford Woodruffon the 23 of August 1844Beloved Mother in IsraelAccording to your request I laymy hands upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazarethand by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the keys of the kingdomof God to bestow a blessing upon you for though art worthy ofall blessingsAs I laid my hands upon thy husbandJoseph the Senior, the Patriarch of the Church by his requestto bless him as he lay upon his bed like Jacob of old readyto gather up his feet and sleep with his fathers and I about 
 to take my departure for foreign nations over the sea which was the last time Iwe met on earth in like manner do I esteam it a blessing and privellge tolay my hands upon your head in your decline of life to leave with youmy parting blessing.I am again called to bid farewell to my nativeland and visit foreign climes to bear record of the words of God. We maynever meet again on earth * but I thank my God that I have thisprivilege of blessing thee for thou art the Greatest Mother inIsrael. The sons which thou hast borne and cherished are themost noble spirits that ever graced humanity or tabernacled in theflesh. Their work shall be had in honourable remembrancethroughout all generations. Though counted among transgressorsthey like the Messiah have shed their blood for the sins ofthe people and freely offered their lives and sealed their testimony^with their blood.^Thou hast lived to see the fall of thy sons by the rage of Gentile hands but like an eternal rock inthe midst of the ocean thou has stood and God has given theethe desire of thy heart in seeing the Keys of his Kingdomheld in the hands of thy posterity so planted on the earththat they shall never be taken from it until He reigns whoseright it is to reign.Let thy heart be comforted in the midstof thy sorrow for thou shalt be had in honourable remembranceforever in the congregations of the righteous. Thou shalt beremembered in thy wants during the remainder of thy days andwhen thou art called to depart thou canst lie down in peacehaving seen the salvation of God in laying an everlastingfoundation for the deliverance of Israel through the instrumentalityof thy sons.I seal upon your head all the blessings of the fulness of the gospel of the "First Born" and allthose blessings which have been sealed upon your headheretofore. If we meet no more on earth we shall meet*We never did. Though Moth Smith lived 15 years after that 
 in the morn of the first resurrection when you shall receive thronesand Powers and dominion and Dingdom with thy husband in hisexaltation in the lineage of his fathers.I seal these blessings upon your headin the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the HolyPriesthood: Amen.Set Apart For My Mission(Nauvoo August 24 1844)The following blessing was confered upon my head andI was set apart by the Twelve for my mission to England to takecharge of all the Churches in Europe Elder John Taylor was mouthpiece for the quorum.Brother Woodruff, We lay our handsupon your head in the name of Jesus Christ and by theauthority of the Holy Priesthood to seal upon your head ablessing and set you apart unto the important mission whichis appointed unto you of the Lord by the voice of the Twelveto go over the Sea to England to take charge of the churchesthroughout that land; and we ask God the Eternal Fatherin the name of Jesus Christ to bless you with healthand strength open^open^ the door before you and your familythat you may have food and rament and money and all thingsnecessary to make you comfortable and that the power of God mayrest upon you in a greater degree than in any missionbefore. We seal upon your head these blessings. You shaltbe preserved to finish your mission and return home with yourfamily and meet in the Temple of the Lord and rejoice thereinand shout Hosanna. You shall have power and wisdom toaccomplish the design of your missions and shall have the desire^of your heart^ given you in all things in righteousness before God." 
 The next day was Sunday and I was called upon toaddress the congregation of Saints assembled in Nauvoo as I was about to leavefor my mission to England. The following is a few of the items I presentedto the people in my discourse."There is a Spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almightygiveth it understanding. It is through this principle that this congregation isassembled together at this place. You had understanding of the things of God^by^and His Spirit..  ^by the Spirit of God.^I have now one important declaration to make to youand that is that inasmuch as you will be united in heart and mind andin action in suppoting your counsellors—the Priesthood of God—theauthorities of the Church and follow the counsel given you as youhave endeavoured to follow the counsel of the Prophet while he was living you will be safe and blessed and will prosper but if you are divided andreject the counsel of God you will fall. Union and faithfulness is yoursalvation. It is true you have been led by one of the best men thatever graced humanity or tabernacled in the flesh but he is gone; hehas sealed [h]is testimony with his blood. He loved this people unto death.I would now call upon this people to beunited in building up on the foundation which the Prophet Joseph haslaid You have been called to suffer much in the cause in whichyou are engaged but if judgement begins at the house of God Babylon willnot escape and if there is a fire in a green tree a dry tree will notescape. There is no people ^more^ prepared for the shock that is comingon the earth than ^the^ Latter-day Saints. The object we have is tosecure blessings beyond the veil in the first resurrection. Thisis what we are preparing for.Again I would say let not the Saints betroubled because they have lost their Prophet. I would ask becausethe Prophet has sealed his testimony with his blood does that destroythe Gospel or take away the Power of God. Is truth annihalatedor has the Priesthood found a burying place? I tell you nayHis testimony is now in force. Therefore my counsel is to 
 follow the example of those who have gone before and be faithful untodeath. If you will be united and go to with your whole mightsin building that Temple you have power to accomplish it andget an endowment"I earnestly exhorted them to faithfulness andrequested their prayers in my  behalf and asked forgiveness of anything which I might have done wrong and bid the congregationfarewell.Joseph Gave the Keys of the Kingdom to the TwelveI was followed by President Brigham YoungAlso Elders P. P. Pratt and Orson Hyde spoke and testified thatJoseph the Prophet had ordained anointed and appointed the Twelveto lead the Church and had given them the keys of the kingdom forthat purpose. W. W. Phelps and R Cahoon bore testimonythat Joseph said upnto the Twelve "Upon your shoulders thekingdom of God must rest in all the world. Now round upyour shoulders and bear it."Many important things were spoken by thebrethren at this time which I had not the leasure to write.Next day I went to the river with MrsWoodruff to be baptized for some of our ^dead^ friends. I was administeredto under the hands of Elder G. A. Smith as proxy for five of myfamily. I also baptized my wife for five of her friends. WillardRichards confirmed us.On the Temple at MidnightAfter preparing for my departure bidding farewellto the Saints and blessing many until midnight of the 27thin company with Brother and Sister Smoot and HannahElls my wife and I walked to the Temple of the Lord inNauvoo. As we approached we lifted up our eyes toview the sacred scene which the silver moon illuminatedwith the brightness of her glory After gazing a few 
 moments upon her walls and her capitols which were standing upon the groundcompleted we all as of one accord ascended the ladders on to the top of the walls:Several of the police and friends followed our example among whom was GeneralCC Richard  and Elder Godard.We repared to the South west corner of the Temple and therewe bowed our knees upon the top corner stone which was prepared to receive itscapitol and theirre with uplifted hands towards heaven I called upon the Godof Abraham Isaac and Jacob; offering the gratitude of our hearts for preservingour lives and giving us power to so far build the Temple; praying that itmight be finished and the Saints receive their endowments to plant the work ofGod in all the earth; asking the Father for a just reckoning for the sheddingof the blood of the Lord's Anointed; praying Him to enable us to fulfil our missionand return to the bosom of the Church; invoking a double portion of the Spirit ofJoseph to rest upon Brigham and the Twelve to bear off the Kingdom in all the world and for the power of the Priesthood to rest upon all the quorums and Eldersof Israel and dedicating myself family and all belonging to me in the nameof Jesus Christ unto the Lord God.After prayers we descended and returned to our homeswith joy and peace in our hearts.Letter of AppointmentNauvoo August 26th 1844To All Elders and Saints in Europe Greeting:We send our beloved brother Wilford Woodruffto England to take charge of all business transactions pertaining to theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both spiritual and temporalWe wish you to give dilligent heed to his counsel in all things and as wehave not the opportunity of informing you of what has transpired thisseason, by letter, our beloved brother will make known unto you all things.We wish the brethren to be faithful and dilligentin keeping all the commandments of God and in hearkening to the counselsof those who are sent to counsel them.

 Leaves Nauvoo for EnglandOn the 28th I parted with the quorum of the Twelve ^at the Temple^ and started onmy mission Our company consisted of myself wife and two children HiramClark and wife and Cap. Dan Jones and wife and three brethren who camewith their teams to convey us to Chicago where we arrived on the 7th ofthe next month, September; and on the next day we went on board the propell [page torn]Oswego to journey up the lakes on our way east.We arrived with a fair breeze at the ManatowIslands at 12 o clock at noon and spent three hours there. With Mrs WoodruffI walked over the same beach that we walked over together after being wreckedon the Chesapeak in Sep 1841. It brought the scene fresh to our mindsWe wrote on some smooth stones concerning our wreck and our missionto England, our names dates &c; and at three o clock we left the Islandand continued our journey.Cry of Fire At MidnightAfter leaving Detroit on the morning of the 17thwe sailed well through the day and evening until midnight when astrong wind arose the lake became rough and the boat rocked badlyand in the midst of it when we we were opposite the Cleveland lighthousea cry of Fire Fire Fire rang through the boat by the watch on deckWe immediately leaped from our births in our night clothes and eachone caught a bucket as best he could and I caught a bucket about halffull of water and ran barefoot as I was to the stern of the boat lookingfor the fire while some was running up stairs. I leaped into the engineroom and saw the fire in one corner of the stern of the boat. I ran over thepile of coal and dashed my water into the fire which was not larger thana half bushel measure at the same time a bucket of water flung by CaptDavis struck the fire and it was extinguished.There is nothing more terrible and alarming than thecry of fire at sea or on any water out of the reach of land. It is far more 
 terrible than a storm or wreck for when fire gets the control all hope is lostand persons will plunge into the raging deep to escape its fury. On myreturn to the cabin I found one woman in convulsions with alarm and MrsWoodruff holding her and she did not get over it until the next day.On the 19th under a fair wind we crossedLake Erie entered the mouth of Welland Canal to go round the Falls into Lake Ontario on the Canadian side. The Canal was 28 mileslong and had 38 locks.On the 23rd in the Lake Ontario a galearose at midnight and during the next day we had a very roughtime and fire again broke out in the midst of it.Journying on by boat and rail I arrivedat my father's house at Farmington on the 30th. My wife andchildren left me on the road several days before to visit her parentsand family.I had quite an interesting time in visitingmy family and friends in Farmington and neighbouring placesand during my stay there I ordained my uncle Ozem Woodruffunto the office of High Priest.My native place & family I left again on the 5th of October andarrived in Boston two days later. Here I found the eastern churcheswere passing through a critical state and I wrote to President Younggiving him an account thereof. Elder G J. Adams at this time was holding discussion with O Bachellon at the Malrlbury Chapel. Itwas a money getting scheme.On the 12th I declaired in great powerand plainness to the Church in Boston against iniquity in all its formsinforming the Saints that any man from the head to the foot wouldbe brought to justice if he broke the commandments of God and advisedall to be cautious and for none to throw themselves to ruin becauseothers do wrong.I had a convers[at]ion with Bro Whitmoreand he related to me the following dream 
 He had prayed to God to let him see Joseph in a dream and hefell asleep and dreamt that he saw the heavens opened and beheld some ofthe things of eternity. He saw a personage rise out of the earth andan Elder informed him that it was Joseph Smith. Joseph did not speakto him but droped some slips of paper on the ground from whencehe arose. Brother Whitmore picked up one of them and read uponit the words— "Emma is not worthy of me." He wishedto read the others but the person with him picked them up and put them in his pocket and did not let him read them.After my meeting that evening Elder Adamsand Brannan prefered a charge against Elder Hardy for slanderand the case was to be tried on the following Tuesday.On the Sunday I met a large congregationSister Vose that day gave me 11 dollars and another sister five tohelp me on my mission and in the afternoon's meeting a collectionwas taken up for the same object making in all about 50 dollarswith the $15 given me at Sister Vose's. At night I attended anotherdiscussion between Adams & Bachellon.I visited Lowel where there I found ElderWilliam Smith; and the Branch at that place was in a sadcondition of disatisfaction and in Boston on that evening the trialwas to come off against Elder John Hardy to try to cut him off forslandering Adams Brannan and William Smith.I was at Gilsum N. H.  on the 21st where Iarrived with two brethren having rode from Peterboro to Elder ChilonMack's son of Solomon Mack. Here I preached in the eveningand spent the night with Solomon Mack aged 72 brother of LucySmith mother of the Prophet Joseph. I spent the evening inconversation about the Smith's family.The next day was the last one set by the Milleritesfor the Comming of Christ. I rode to the old home stead of MotherSmith where she was born on the side of a hill and the Brook Ashuilet [Ashuelot River]It was truly a rural place. We rode through Walpole had a good 
 view of Westminster in Vermont called upon several brethren and incompany with Elders Charles A Adams and Alfred Cordon preached inthe evening at the schoolhouse at Drewsville.Next day I was a[t] Peterborough and thence onthe following to Boston where at the Post Office I found a letter from my wife stating that both her and the children were very sick.I directly started on the next day to my wifeand arrived at Scarborough on the same day and found my wife & childrenHere for the next month I was as it were blockaded with sicknessand surrounded with darkness and it seaemed as if the dDestroyer waswas trying to hedge up my way to hinder me on my mission fornot only my wife and children but a number of her family was afflictednigh unto death.We left our little daughter Phebe Ameliawith my wife's father and mother and on the 21st of NovemberI started with my wife and youngest child Susan Cornelia for NewYork to set sail for England.A Peculiar Dream [FIGURE]While at my father-in-laws I dreamt a peculiardream. Much of it was unutterable and cannot be written. IndeedI cannot comprehend it myself. Among other things I thoughtI was called to hold with the Twelve the Keys of the Kingdom in allthe world and I travelled with them over much of the earthand finally travelled through many countries alone and whenI got through I saw many things which I cannot write andin the end Joseph Smith the Prophet assissted me to come intothe place where he was and pointed out my work and portion^and^ of labour. I immediately entered into the dutiesassigned me.I also had on the same night anotherdream. I was in the presence of the Prophet Joseph 
 and was conversing with him about his death. I told him I felt bad aboutit and that had I known he would have been taken away so soon I shouldhave conversed more with him while living and asked him more questionsHe said it was not his fault I did not. Speaking of my work and dutieshe said I had better get a dozen to help me.II stoped at Boston on my way and met with theChurch and cut off eight from the Church who had joined Sydney Rigdon'sfaction. This left the Boston Church firm.On the Sunday Nov 24th after leaving BostonI was with the Saints in New Bedford with whom I held meetingsthat day during which three were baptized.The Monday I spent taking a view of thecity which for beauty and elegance and location is hardly to besurpassed. It is a ^the most^ noted city for fitting out of walemen.The whole city has been built up through the wale trade. Thedocks were lined with casks of wale and sperm oil. We wentaboard of a number of wale ships which were fitting out whichwould carry from fifteen hundred to three thousand barrels ofoil. A sister gave me three pair of specimen of shels broughtfrom the wale country.I arrived in New York on the29 where I received a letter from my father and mother in lawstating that Samuel Deming had turned him off from themill which he had rented and occupied all his lifetime to oldage and after he had spent the last summer in repairing the millsand when they were ready to start and the Winter comingon he turned him off without notice.At New York I also received a letterfrom President Young in answer to the one I wrote him fromChicago and several days after its receipt I wrote a longletter to President Young ^him^ informing him of the recklessness ofWilliam Smith and George J. Adams during that season. 
 I was at the time on a visit to Philadelphia spendinga few days with Jedediah M. Grant and the Saints there. I returnedto New York on the fourth of December being accompanied 40miles on the way by Elder J. M. Grant.The 5th was my last day on shore whichI spent with my wife's brother Ilus F. Carter packing up my trunksand preparing to leave.We were on board the splendid newpacket ship John R. Skiddy Capt Wm Skiddy with sailshoisted going out of Sandy Hook about 11 o'clock Dec the 8thwhen the pilot left us and we steared on our course.The company of the brethren and familiesconsisted of myself wife and child Elder Dan Jones and wifeand Elders Milton Holmes and Leonard Hardy onmission to England to build up and sustain the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in that land.We had a heavy gale on the 11th andwe were driving under head winds and bare poles during theday and in the evening about 9 o'clock the gale increased andit seemed as though the yards would be torn from the mastWe kneeled before the Lord and prayed unitedly that he wouldcause the gale to cease and the wind to change that we mightgo forward and not backward. In a little time the windsuddenly ceased and finally changed to the South-west whichgave us fair wind.Christmas day on the ocean whichwas the first one I ever spent at Sea. We had preserve puddingfor dinner and short cake. We enjoyed ourselves had a lightbreeze and one sail in sight.We entered the Irish Channel on the 28th and here we were beating about under foul windsfor some days. 
 [FIGURE]A Dream  on the Night of the 30th Dec 1844I dreamt that I was in Council with the martyred Prophetand Patriarch and also with the quorum of the Twelve Apostles inAmerica. I thought we had all to be ordained for some purposeI was called upon by President Young and another person to assistin administering the ordinances. In the midst of the Council SidneyRigdon came in and was objected to by Hyrum Smith. Iawoke and again fell asleep and dreamt of being in Councilwith the Twelve and others. I made an address to themJohn E. Page arose to address the meeting but was stopedby some female and was followed by Elder Willard Snow.I have recorded this dream at the time inmy daily Journal yet I did not pay much attention to dreamson shipboard.The close of the year found us beartingabout as we had been for several days in the Irish Channel.Synopsisof the travels and labours of Wilford Woodruff in 1844I travelled in the United States in many of the principalplaces and minor towns and cities in all visiting between 50and a hundred journeyed through some part of Canada and crossedthe Atlantic making in all a distance of ten thousand andfifty miles.I held fifty three meetings and attendedten Conferences. 
 Councils with the First Presidency & TwelveI met with the quorum of the Twelve in twelve Councilsand with Joseph Hyrum the quorum of Apostles and other brethren in transacting the affairs of the Kingdom in thirteen Councils.In The EndowmentsI attended with Joseph Hyrum and the Twelvein receiving our endowments twenty one meetings.Baptized for the DeadI was proxy in the ordinance of baptism for thedead for nineteen persons.Baptized Confirmed & OrdainedI baptized for the remission of sins 6 persons andconfirmed 42 and I ordained 1 Patriarch 3 High Priests25 Elders 9 Priests 3 Teachers and 2 Deacons.Married Blessed &cI married two couple blessed six children and administeredto 24 sick persons.Sermons Reported etc.I reported 11 sermons of the Prophet Joseph and 17 of the Twelveand others all of which I recorded in my Journal and wrote 65 lettersand received 17 and obtained a number of subscribers to our papers. 
 The New Year at SeaThe New Year found me and my family and companionsDan Jones and wife and Elders Hiram Clark Milton Holmesand Leonard Hardy still on the Packet ship John R Skiddybeating about in the Irish Channel against head wind as wehad been for five days making but little progress.On the 3rd of Jan. we landed in Liverpool glad to put our feet again on the land after being 27days at Sea. On landing we took a cab and drove to 36Chapel Street to find Elder Hedlock but no one being in wespent the night at the Pig & Whistle but the next day I had aninterview with Elders Hedlock and Ward and spent a little timein talking over affairs.The5th was Sunday and we held meetingsin the Music Hall at which myself and companions EldersDan Jones, Clark Hardy and Holmes addressed the Saints. 
 Farmington June 25 1845Dear Son & Daughter Wilford & Phebe WoodruffDays weeks & months have elapsed since your Parents commen-enced looking for a communication from their Children the other side the atlantic, but they looked in vain, they however had the satisfaction at length (th o, a mysterious one,) of hearing secondhanded by the way of sister Betsy that they were in the land of the living & in the enjoyment of health which we were truly glad to learn, yet we were much pugzzled in our minds as to what it could all mean for we knew that Son Wilford had ever paid specialattention to addressing his Parents by way of writing & particularly so when at England, but we could not understand why a Letter should not come as direct here as to simsbury & yet we could not feel that he would now pay less attention to his Parents than formerly under their present peculiarcirscumstances, but, we had finally concluded to write you without waiting longer to hear from you—when about three days since your father brought in a Letter saying, he believed it was from Webster, I took it very anxiously & said, are you sure it is from Nauvoo—he thought so. I commenced reading it & had poerused some lines before I found that it was actually from England this was under date of April 18th we were rejoiced to learn as we did there from that you were enjoying good health through the mercy & favor of God & also that you had the heartfelt joy of learning that your little one you left behind is also alive & well together with other friends, your Letter was all interesting but yet w[e] [c]ould not feel that this was the first, written by you to us since your arrival at England your father said he was sure this must the second & I thought truly the exspression that you had not heard a word from us denoted that you had previously written, as the understanding between us was that I should write after hearing from you—But I will Inform you somewhat of our situation the winter past, we have both enjoyed comfortable health for the most part, your father has laboured in the old Saw Mill thro the winter when he has not at Wards, or the Doctors old Mill, he ^has^ taken charge of both which has

 Salt Lake, February the 26th 1894.Dear sir!Excuse me if I allow me to take the liberty to take up with the presenta few minuts of your valuable time.I am in distress, both of my arms have been paralyzed in consequence of lead poisoning, am unable to do any hard work, have not been capable to obtain any suitable employment, which would enable me to make a living, in spite of my most ernest efforts, and I am forced to ask for help. Therefore I allow me to recommend myself to your kind consideration for assistance.RespectfullyFrank Kruger 
 furnished him with employ thro the winter & spring to the present time except a small period in winter & then we both felt that it was quite as profitable for him, or would be to recruit a while as to continue laboring — we have enjoyedourselves as well since we have been at this place as perhaps at any period of our lives, we have a convenient & pleasant house — especially now as it is coming warm weather. I could not have supposed it possible, that I could have madeit home so readily as I did, concidering my attachment to an establishedhome, but I will faurther say, that we have lived as comfortable & as a well as we ever did, tho your father as not purchased as much fresh meatthro the winter as formerly, but he has not cared as much about it, he has paid his rent monthly & in this has gone beyond the young Men who have lived in the house with us & he has not as yet I believe taken up all his earnings has not considered ^it^ so at any rate, We recd a Letter from Azmon some two or three months since stating that they were all in comfortable health that he intended to have written us before at the time Thompson returned last fall his object was to invite his Father to come & live with them or by — & this he did in a very handsome & feeling manner he thought he could provide work a plenty for him if he wished it, that he was about setting up a shingle Mill, &c that tho he did not wish to influence either of us or urgeus to come contrary to our minds yet that after all it was his opinion that it would be better for us to go there as ^truly^ should we even want to go to Nauvoo to live with our children there, we should only be so far on our wayWe have not yet written him in reply, but must before long he said that when we had made up our minds on the subject, wished us to writeour minds I expect were not long wanting in this respect at least mine was not, your father said at the time, he did not know but we had better go there as he she should not probably be able to live here a great while being so dependant on others for such work as he would be able to do, but Itold him, I expected providence would provide a way for us to be with our children & the saints at Nauvoo — but, that I thought we might as wellgive up our principles at once as to think of going to Richland to live however kindly disposed Azmon might be towards us — I have justgot Azmonds Letter to see what he wanted us to say to you, he writes thus,"I was very sorry I could not meet Br Wilford at your house last Nov, but I could not.

Wilfred Woodruff,President of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints.Dear Sir:Regretting my inability to see you when I called yester-day, I take the liberty of addressing you this note which will explain the pur-pose of my visit. The San Francisco Examiner, which I have the honor to repre-sent, will publish about February 1st next, a special-edition to be known as the Midwinter Fair edition, which will be devoted to the in-terests of the Western statesand territories. This paperwill be the best newspaper ever published in America. 
 THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER.To the Latter-day Saints in Zion and throughout the world:Beloved Brethren and Sisters—Alittle over two years ago we were im-pressed to call upon the Latter-day Saints to set apart a day for fastingand solemn prayer unto the Lord.Our position at that time was such that it seemed as though no earthlypower could deliver us from the evilwhich environed us and which threat-ened our overthrow. Turn whichway we would, every avenue seemedclosed against us. Human help was be-yond our reach. Our eyes and heartsunder those circumstances, turned to the Lord as the only power to whichwe could appeal for succor. Do wesay too much when we testify that theLord did on that occasion condescend to hear and answer the supplicationof His people.Their humiliation before Him wasnot without its fruits. If the objectswhich were suggested in our circularletter at that time to be prayed for beexamined, the results will show howwonderfully the Lord has granted the prayers of His people?In view of this, and the great mercyshown unto us by our Father in heaven in permitting us, at our recentGeneral Conference, to lay the topstone of the Salt Lake Temple withshouts of Hosanna to God and the Lamb, it has suggested itself to us that it would be most appropriate for theLatter-day Saints to gather in theirvarious places of worship, on Sundaythe first day of May, 1892, and in fast-ing and prayer, offer up to the MostHigh their heartfelt and solemnthanksgivings for His goodness andmercy, which He has shown unto themand the deliverance that He haswrought out in their behalf.Surely, no people have greater causefor thanksgiving and praise than have the Latter-day Saints throughout thesemountains. And as we cannot have occasion for thanksgiving because of deliverance wrought our for us, with-out our brethren and sisters in otherlands sharing in our joy, it is properthat they, too, should select a day, asmay be suitable and convenient tothem, in like manner to fast and prayand offer up their gratitude and thanksto the Great Creator for the blessingsHe has bestowed upon His people.We have decided to select Sundayfor this purpose, because it can meetwith a more general observance onthe part of all the people than would be possible upon any other day.Every man, woman and child be-longing to our Church should joinin this glad service, for, althoughwe have many obstaclcs to con-tend with, and the adversary of oursouls has not made truce, nor laiddown his arms, yet the Lord hasspoiled many nf his schemes, and des-troyed his snares, and has provided forus a way of escape from his power.In our prayers we should still sup-plicate the Almighty Father to con-tinue to bless and deliver His Zion, andto prepare the way for the ushering inof the full reign of righteousness andtruth, when He whose right it is toreign shall hold undisputed sway overall the earth.The following resolution was unani-mously adopted by the immense as-semblage of people at the laying of the top-stone of the Temple:Believing that the instruction of President Woodruff, respecting theearly completion of the Salt LakeTemple, is the word of the Lord to us,I propose that this assemblage pledgethemselves, collectively and individu-ally, to furnish, as fast as it may beneeded, all the money that may be re-quired to complete the Temple at the earliest time possible, so that the dedi-cation may take place on April 6th,1893.Plans have been suggested for thecollection of the funds needed to complete the Temple in accordance withthis resolution: but we have decidedthat no better occasion could offer forthis purpose than the time when theSaints shall be assembled to ob-serve this day of prayer and thanks-giving. Subscriptions can then betaken by the various Bishops and otherpresiding officers from all who arepresent at the meetings; and if all arenot prepared to give that which they desire to subscribe at the time, theycan make their arrangements to payby installments.It is very desirable that this laborshould be completed so that thesacred building can be dedicated to theLord at the General Conference, April6th, 1893. Steps have already beentaken to have the work done, with thefull expectation that the funds whichwere voted for when this reso-lution was adopted will be forthcomingin time to meet all the payments. We feel assured there will be no disap-pointment in this, if the Bishops andother presiding authorities do their duty.There is no labor in which the Lat-ter-day Saints feel more deeply inter-ested than in the building and com-pleting of Temples.This Temple at Salt Lake City haslong been in process of erection. By the6th of April next, forty years will haveelapsed since the laying of the founda-tion stones. It seems proper, then, thatthe expiration of that period should wit-ness its dedication. We trust that noexertions will be spared to accomplishthis end, and that all will respond lib-erally to the call which will be madeupon them.Praying the Lord to bestow upon allthe Latter-day Saints upon this occa-sion the spirit of prayer and thanks-giving, we remain,Your Brethren,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEO. Q. CANNON,JOSEPH F. SMITH,First Presidency of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

 united together in the Everlasting Covenant. I had often thought howmuch I should like to see the Prophet Joseph meet with a Conference of Saints in England but it was not grantedto the British nation to have the Prophet in their midst norto him nor us to see him meet in England the thousands whohad entered into the New Covenant which God through his missionhad mad[e] unto Israel.This was one of the most interestingConference I ever attended abroad and this day was fullfilleda prophecy which I gave in the House of the Lord in Kirtlandin 1837 that I should attend a Conference with Elder Milton Holmesin the British Isles.On the 3rd day after our conference Itook the railway cars from Manchester to Bradford where Iarrived at noon and in the afternoon, Elijah F Sheets arrivedfrom Leeds.

 We had a beautiful green vale to pass through before arriving at Idle which is on the top of a hill. The fields of grasswere as green as in May though it was but February which gavethe landscape around us a picturesque and verdant charm. Wewere walking on the road which our departed brother had walked overmany scores of times to preach the Gospel of Jesus and I feltsorrowful and filled with meditation.Arriving at Idle containing a population of seven thousand inhabitants and a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints numbering 37 members we called upon Elder Thomas Cordingly and family who had the care of ElderBarnes through his sickness and death. They pointed outto me the house and room where he passed ^t^his^e^ last hours of his mortal life.After partaking of some refreshments wewalked to the Churchyard and reverently gazed upon the peaceful silentgrave of our beloved brother. My feelings were sensitive and sad. As I stood upon his grave I realised that I was standingover the body of one of the Elders of Israel of the "horns of Joseph,"one of the members of " Zion's Camp" who travelled more than one thousand miles in 1834 for the redemption of his persecutedand afflicted brethren ready to lay down his life for their sakesand whose fidelity was a strong trait of character.While standing upon his grave I offeredup my vocal prayer to Israel's God that I might die the deathof the righteous when called away and that my last end mightbe as safe as our beloved and departed brother's and that his sacreddust might be called forth in the morn of the First Resurrection.

 Elder Willford Woodruff addressed the saints; eulagized thereon the extent of their improvements since he last visited them. Thesevallies of the mountains are almost the only place on the earth wherepeace reigns. Our object in all that we do should be to build upthe kingdom of God with our substance and not place our hearts uponit to idolize; if we ^desire to^ gather gold let it be the golden grain from ourfields, and then let us take good care of it, that our wives and childrenmay have plenty of bread when famine shall spread dismay amongall nations. Cultivate the earth, take care of your flocks and herds,let the holy spirit of God dwell in you, and then you will becontended and happy, and have no disposition to go to the mines to seek it there.

 Meditating upon his life I retired from the grave of Elder Barnes in companywith my brethren who had come with me to pay our reverant respectand remembrance of our departed brother and on our return to thefamily who attended him in his last moments I made enquiriesand obtained the following informationThe Cause Sickness & Death of Lorenzo BarnesOne day in the latter part of September 1843Elder Barnes walked very fast for about thirteen miles toreach the railway station in time to take the cars. Somepart of the way he ran and got into a high state of perspirationand only had time step into the train just as it was startingHe rode on the railroad for about twenty miles during whichtime he became entirely chilled which thro ^gave^ him a severe coldthat settled upon his lungs and brought on quick consumptionfrom which he never recovered. He attended conference and preachedseveral times afterwards but was very feble. The last timehe preached was from the passage—"There remaineth thereforea rest for the people of God." After he was confined to hisbed he was asked if he would have a physician but answered"No." If he died he would die a natural death. If he livedhe should live unto the Lord if he died he should die unto theLord. He manifested a great desire to live if it should bethe will of God that he might return to Nauvoo. He wasdeprived of his reason during some portion of the time and hiswhole conversation on such intervals would be about Nauvoohow he should yet there and his friends. He spoke of hismother frequently. The night before his death he had hisreason and he then bore a strong and faithful testimony of thetruth of the fulness of the Gospel as taught by the Latterday Saints 
 I also learned that Elder Barnes suffered by going withpoor boots and wet feet from place to place. He was slow to make hiswants known to the brethren and some were slow to administer to themuntil he got sick. Every attention however was paid to him after hewas confined to his bed but then it was too late.I enquired if there were any writings left by him such as Journals &c but could find nothing excepting severalfragments of a correspondence in poetry between himself and his intendedwife which showed the strong fidelity of his heart so characteristicof the man throughout every action of his life. These fragments Icopied from his M.S. into my daily Journal.I preached to a good congregation at Idle that eveningand the next day in company with Elders Sheets and Ure and AbrahamLord the presiding Elder of the Idle Branch I returned to Bradford.The brethren placarded the town with the followingnotice:Conference: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints will hold their Conference in the Philadelphia Chapel North WingBradford on Sunday Feb 23rd 1844; to commence at ten o'clock in themorning two in the afternoon and six in the evening; when there willbe present on the occassion two Americans, one of whom belongs tothe quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Also there will be preaching on the fulness of the everlasting gospel as revealed by an angel of the Lord inthese last days on the following ^evenings^ Monday Tuesday and Wednesdayin the said chapel to commence at eight o'clock each evening. N. B.People of all Persuasions are invited to attend.This Conference was duly held according to notice of which I here give the epitome. 
 Bradford Quarterly Conferenceheld in the Philadelphia Chapel Bradford YorkshireFeb 23 1845Present: Wilford Woodruff of the Quorum of the Twelve 1 High Priest1 Seventy 9 Elders 9 Priests 6 Teachers and 4 DeaconsElijah F. Sheets the President of the conferencewas called to the chair and Priest Beecroft chosen clerk.The meeting being duly opened the Conferencewas represented consisting of three Branches—Bradford Leedsand Idle numbering in the whole 168 members.There was a good number of the Saintsgathered together and an excellent band of music in front of thepulpit accompanied the singers. In the morning Elder Woodruffaddressed the meeting.The chapel in the afternoon was crowdedwith the Saints and citizens. Sacrament was administeredand I again addressed the congregation but was somewhat interuptedby a man intoxicated who had been cut off the church.In the evening we again had a crowdedhouse and the music and singing which commenced our servicewas inspiring. It fell to my lot once more to address thecongregation during the evening and I took for my text theXIV of Rev 6 7 & 8 verses. In my discourse I gave an account ofthe rise and progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints the leading mind of Joseph Smith how he was called of Godby the administration of angels and traced the subject through tothe sealing of his testimony with his blood.I spoke for the space of one hour withthe power of God and the congregation was as still as death anda most intense interest prevailed. During the Conference 
 I confirmed 4 persons blessed 3 children and laid hands upon twelve persons for the healing of their infirmaties.Two days afterwards I returned to Liverpool stopingon the way several hours at Manchester which I spent with Elder Holmes.March the 1st was my birthday and I was thirty eight years of age and in Liverpool presiding over the British Mission and with memy wife.An Attempt to Rob the Church of the Copyright ofThe Book of Doctrine and CovenantsOn my birthday I received a letter from a friendcontaining the copy of a letter dated Pittsburgh Jan 30, 1845 written byJohn Greenhow to his father in Kendal stating that he was getting theDoctrine and Covenants stereotyped in Pittsburg and that he was going tobring the plates to England to print the work here and get the copyright securedso that the Church could not print them it.This was indeed a bold move of the apostates toundertake to undertake to print the works of the Church and such abook as the Doctrine and Covenants which is the second standard work of theChurch and I viewed it as nothing less than the providence of Godwhich ^put^ the knowledge of this design to rob the Church of the copyrightinto my hands. I spent the day in examining the law of England upon the securing of copyright.I spent the forepart of the following day athome and the afternoon with Elders Hedlock and Ward upon whom at thistime I laid my hands and ordained as my counsellors and they thenlaid their hands upon me and blessed me. Afterwards we partookof the sacrament together and then we called upon God our Father tobless us and frustrate the designs of our enemies and overthrow thedesigns ^plans^ which they had laid to rob the Church and injure the cause 
 of God.I wrote President Young giving him account of theaffairs of the mission and informed him of the deep laid schemeof those at Pittsburg, America, John Greenhow Samuel Benettand others to rob the Church of the copyright of the Book ofDoctrine and Covenants. I also wrote to the Secretary atStationers Hall to secure the Copyright of the work myself forthe Church and wrote to brother Curedon to send me a copy of the Doctrine and Covenants.Preston Quarterly Conference was held on Sunday the 9th of March at which myself and Elder Wardattended. Elder John Banks was called to the chair. Duringthe day Elder Leonard Hardy was chosen to preside over theConference and there were eleven Branches represented with 505members.Next day I took a walk through the city andvisited the old Cockpit where Elders Kimball and Hyde hadpreached so much at the first opening of the British mission andwhere also Dr Willard Richards afterwards also preached.We walked up and down the river wheremany hundred of the Saints had been baptized and I also viewed^from where^ the Scotch made an attack upon the English at Preston when the gallant enthusiastic followers ^army^ of the Young Pretender made their illfatedand mad attempt to unseat the first George from the Englishthrone and give it to their bonnie Charle ^[Washed] it the house of the Stuarts^. Some of the Scotchentered the town as far as the Cockpit but most of them wasslain in the valley. I saw their burial place. There is now a grove growing over their bodies. This was in the year 1745just one hundred years before this date.We returned to the town and after dinnerI took the parting hand of Elders Banks and Hardy and theSaints of Preston and returned to Liverpool. 
 Lord Nelson's Monument Liverpool.In company with my wife and Sisters Clark and HaywoodI visited Nelson's Monument the design of which was made by MathewCharles Wyatt of London and was executed in bronze by RichardWestmacott also of London and the pedestal of Hendal Marble byMessrs Hetherington and Webster of Liverpool. The subscriptionto build it commenced on the 15th of Nov 1805 and ^was^ completed the sameyear amounting to £9000 and the first stone was laid July 15th 1812.The principal figure is Admiral Nelsonresting one foot on a conqured enemy and the other on a cannon his eyestedfast and upraised to Victory from whom he is receiving a fourthnaval crown upon his swoard held in his left hand indicating the loss ofhis right which is concealed by the flag which the genius of Victoryis lowering over him. Under the folds of this flag Death liesin ambush indicating that he received the reward of Victory and the stroke of Death at the same time. There is an enraged Britishsailor represented symbolizing the zeal of the navy to revenge the loss of itsmost illustrious chief, and in the back ground is Britannia leaning onher sphere and shield with lauarral in her hand but she ^is^ regardless of themrepresenting the country's pride and anguish over the triumph so darlypurchased.Around the upper moulding of the pedestal areinscribed Nelson's ever memorable words—"England expects every manto do his duty". At the base of the pedestal are four figures inchains as captives emblematical of the four great victories he achieved andthe space between these figures on the sides of the pedestal is filled by fourgrand bass reliefs executed in bronze ^also^ representing those gloriousvictories—namely, St Vincent 14 Feb. 1797; Nile 1st Aug. 1798;Copenhagen 2nd of April 1801; Trafalgar 21st of Oct. 1805. Thefigures are all of the proportion of seven feet. Lord Nelson was 
 born Sep. 29, 1758.The whole range of the buildings called The Exchangecost £110,848; Flaging £36,000; Town Hall £156,000.After visiting this monument we went through severalof the principal ^streets^ and viewed them and then returned home.The day following which was the 13thI took the steamer Commodore for Glasgow in company withElders Hedlock Ward and Banks and arrived at the mouth ofthe river Clyde at 6 o'clock next morning.We passed Gourock, Greennock, Port GlasgowDumbarton at the mouth of the river Leven at which stands the rock so noted in Scotish history and called Dumbarton Castleon which is stationed a regiment of soldiers to protect the riverClyde.We had a fair view of Bell's monumenterrected in memory of John Bell who was the first to run a steamerup the river Clyde to Glasgow which is confined to its banksby a stone wall for sixteen miles.The Highlands were covered with snowand we arrived in Glasgow in the midst of a severe snowstorm.In the evening we held a Council with the officers of the Branch and two days afterwards which wasthe 16th we heldThe Glasgow Conferenceat the Odd Fellow's Hall GlasgowThe meeting was called to order by ElderPeter McCue was called to the chair and aAfter singing andprayer 15 Branches of the Church wasere represented containing1065 members 35 Elders 51 Priests 37 Teachers 24 Deacons.Wm Gibson was clerk of the Conference.During the day the vast assembly 
 of the Saints was addressed by Elders Hedlock Ward Banks and myself. Ifelt much interested in this my first visit and Conference among the Scotish SaintsNext day I called ^took the^ rail to Coats Bridge and thence wentto Whifflett and held a Council with the officers of that Branch and the followingmorning I took a walk to visit Dunbyvan Iron Works. From thence we visited ^walked^^to Ashley and called upon the brethren there and then visited^ the extensive Calder Banks Mallable Iron WorksI next visited the Ardrie Museumcollected and kept by Mr James Myrdock antiquarian. After takingsome refreshments with him he showed us each appartment of the Museumand among the many curiosities I had a view of coins from about 1000years before Christ down to the present day. Among the rest werecoins bearing the names and profile of Pallios 1000 B.C. Antonius,Vespersion Caesar, Servius, Christianna, Comodus, Posthumus,Artaxus, Tragin, Domician, Antonius, Gordian, Auridian, Hiradien,Claudius Caesar, and Pius.There was quite a collection of natural Historyand three and half tons of precious books as a liberary. I sawalso a ^metal pot^ bearing this inscription: "One Hundred and twenty years after Christ. I belong to St. Lawrence." I also sawthree gold and silver Roman crosses stolen by travellers from the Vatican at Rome, 300 years old, besides a number of weapons of warand paintings of ancient date.Afterwards we called at a brothers house and Ilaid hands upon six who were sick and blessed twenty persons who pledwith me to let them have a blessing under the hands of an Apostle.  I preached in the evening to a crowded house and afterwards walked to brother Carruthers and spent the night.I dreamt a rattlesnake bit me on the ancle but Ipulled him off squezed him to death and much poison ran out ofhim. The interpretation was that when we arrived at EdinboroughI should be opposed by [blank] for appointingJohn Banks to preside over that Branch and Conference of theChurch. 
 Returning to Glasgow and joining Elders Hedlock andWard we took the rail to Castle Carery and thence by coach to Sterlingand as we came in sight of it among the mountains we had a fineview of the famed Sterling Castle which brought to mind the heroicWallace & the royal Bruce in their renowned wars to free Scotland fromthe English yoke. Sterling Castle was taken by Wallace inone of his most famous acts.Arriving at Sterling we called uponElder Daniel Sutherland in John Street and took supper andthen called upon John Gillies 76 years of age. He was the thirdman in the formation of the 92 Ilanders was in the army for21 years and embraced the Gospel in the 73 year of his ageI had an interesting conversation with him during the eveningand we spent the night at his house.Sterling Castle.Next morning with brothers Hedlock Wardand Gillies we visited Sterling castle and went through every appartmentof it. As we passed up the avenue leading to the castlewe closely examined the palace of Mary Queen of Scots and the King'sstables and went into them!In going through the old castle we sawthe armoury and old flags and many things of antiquity We went into the Chaple of John Knox and closely examined the oakpulpit in which he preached and where he baptized Prince HenryI brought away a small piece of the pulpit and stood upon theexatct spot where the fierce Scotish reformer Knox stood and preached his first sermon. Here I also saw the place inthe old church where stood the Twelve Apostles in stone figureswhich Knox destroyed before commencing his sermon and fiercedenunciation against popery and image worship. We also hada view of the habitation of the Earl of Lecester in 1639 andCemens Hospital and the place where James the VI was crownedWe had a pleasant view of Sterling Castle and the surrounding country from its heights. 
 While at Sterling I laid my hands upon the veteran JohnGillies and blessed him and ordained him an Elder and on the third dayfrom our arrival we took steamboat for Edinborough where we arrived atseven oclock and after taking some refreshments at Henry McEwan's thePresiding Elder we went to the meetingThis was the first time I had ever been in Edinboroughand the Edinborough Conference of the Church was in a divided state formany aspiring spirits were there and had been manifested for a lengthof time. I prayed God to give us wisdom to set this Conferencein order.Edinborough Castle.Next day we viewed the renowned city of Edinboroughand visited its castle and went through each appartment of it. From theCastle we had a splendid view of the city of Edinborugh and surroundingcountry for many miles. The rock itself which forms the site ofthe castle is three hundred and eighty ^3^ feet above the level of the sea andis accessable only on the eastern side the other sides being nearly perpendicular.The castle is of great antiquity and has been heldas a fortress from the earliest times. In 1093 it was besieged by Donald^Bane^ brother to King Malcolm; taken by the English in 1296, retaken anddemolished by Randolph 1313, rebuilt by Edward the III of England,surprised by Wm. Douglas 1341, and by Albany in 1482; takenby the Regent Murray from Mary Queen of Scots, his half sister, in 1573;by Cromwell in 1650 and by William the III of Englandin 1689.The Scotish Regalia are kept in the castle.They were placed there in 1707 and discovered in an oken chest in the crown room in 1818. This is King David's crown, first King of Scotland.I also inspected the celebrated piece of artilarycalled Mons Meg cast at Mons in Flanders. It was used in theseige of Norham and afterwards burst in firing a salute to the Dukeof York on his visit to the castle in 1682. It was forged in1486 out of large bars of iron. Its weight was seven and half tonsand it carried 268 pound shot, the bore was twenty inches and 
 its length fifteen feet.After visiting the Armoury and going througheach appartment of the castle and taking the splendid views of the surrounding country we left and visited other portions of thecity and among the rest saw The old house where JohnKnox the Scotish Reformer was born May 2nd 1505 anddied Nov 24, 1572.Visit to the Palace of HolyroodWe next visited the palace of Holyrood. It occupies thesite of an Abbey which was founded by David the I. in 1128and which was one of the richest religious establishments in Scotland.In the chapel ^of the palace^ were deposited the remains of David II; James II; PrinceArthur third son of James IV; James V; Magdalene his queen;Arthur Second son of James V, and Henry Darnley. Theruins of what is now called the Chapel Royal is worthy of notice.The Picture Gallery of Holyrood whichis 156 feet long by 27 1/2 wide and 20 feet in height containsthe potriats of the Scotish monarchs.In the palace are preserved several relicsof the unfortunate Queen Mary of Scotts. I saw her workboxvisited her bed chamber and saw the bed and furniture and thechair occupied by her when married and also visited her dressingroom both of which was hung with the most splendid ancient tapestry.I saw the hiding palace of Lord Darnleyand his associates when they murdered David Rizzio Mary's musicianand the place where the victim fell and the stain of his bloodwhich yet remains. I also saw the armour worn by Lord Darnley at the time of the murder and I put on Darnley's stealhead dress which was heavy. 
 We visited each appartment of this palace of Kings one ofwhich was the s[t]ate room of George the IV where was his throne and portraitin his highland dress by David Wilkey and among the curiosities of thischief dwelling place of Scotland's royality I saw the bones of the kings inthe vault pilled up together. Cromwell took away their coffins and lefttheir bones scattered upon the ground. Here was the end of humangreatness symbolized in a nations royal burrial place in the Palace ofits kings.We called upon one of the brethren after our visit toHolyrood and having taken dinner started out again to view otherportions of the city. Sir Walter Scotts Monument is a splendidspecimen of art.On the following day we held conference inthe city.The Edinborough Conferenceof theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsSunday March 23, 1845Present: One of the Twelve Apostles 3 High Priests 8 Elders 16 Priestsand four Teachers.

In the evening I preached 
 to an attentive congregation.A company of young men who called themselvesthe Nauvoo Legion escorted us out to see the city next morning and theyled us to the very top of the high cliff known as Arthur's Seat whichwas the highest peak of rocks anywhere in this region and a good partof the way up was almost perpendicular. I was informed thatElder Orson Pratt while he was establishing the Branch in Edinboroughwhich he found about as difficult as we did the establishing of thework in London, would frequently go to the top of this rock as aplace of retreat and meditation.From this rock we had a full view ofthe whole city of Edinborough and the surrounding country whichpresented to us a sublime prospect. I was quite unwell witha severe cold and and felt wearied in reaching the top of this rockor Arthours Seat which was also the case with the rest of the brethrenas far as fatigue was concerned.When we had sufficiently viewed thecountry around we returned took dinner and then visited severalof the Saints and in the evening we held a council meetingof the officers.The day after we parted with the Saints, in Edinborough took the rail to Glasgow where we spent 3 hourswith the brethren then continued by rail to Grenock andthence by steamboat for Liverpool. Elder Hedlock andmyself were together; brother Ward had been left in Edinboroughby accident.We had a disagreable night on board andI arrived in Liverpool sick and weary and for several day continuedunwell and mostly unfit for business.On my return I received several ofnumbers of the Times and Seasons and Neighbour andthe New York Prophet also a letter from Elder GeorgeA Smith.

Elder Woodruff presidedsupported by his counsellors Reuben Hedlock and Thos Ward.After the Conference was duly opened thePresident called upon the delegates to represent the various conferencesof the British Mission which occupied the forenoon. It wasmuch the largest representation ever given in England up to thisdate notwithstanding our emigrations.The afternoon was occupied by the Delegatesin representing the condition of their Conferences and the eveningwas spent in the same manner and the Hall was filled witha large assembly.At the close of the evening I occupieda few moments as delegate from America in representingmy Conference consisting of the United States containing

 Having spent the intermediate time to the 15th in andaround Manchester visiting the Churches and the Saints at their homes myselfand wife returned to Liverpool. Here I found letters at the office for metwo of which was from President Young and P. P. Pratt. These letters werefull of public interest and brother Brigham's spoke of the progress ofthe Temple and affairs of Nauvoo.The Maynooth GrantOn the 21st I attended a meeting appointed by the ministerof the Church of England for the purpose of opposing the MaynoothGrant which was then under discussion in the British ParliamentThe whole country was in an excitement upon the matter and alarmwas created throughout the Protestant Churches of England. The meetingwas held in the Music Hall where the Saints held their services andthe celebrated Rev Hugh McNeile was chairman. The speakersconsidered that Parliament was betraying the country and strikinga death blow at the three hundred years of reformation. Many addresseswere made and resolutions formed and the meeting broke up athalf past ten.I spent the 23rd at the Office examining theand aranging the trunk and relics of our departed friend and brotherLorenzo D. Barnes. I carefully filed all his corresepondence and packedin his trunk together with his own compositions Journals PatriarchalBlessings &c also a dozen or more of choice coin of ancient date andcharacters which he probably collected for the Nauvoo Museumwith one weight the standard for a soverign and his finger ring allof which I carefully put in a package and sealed it with wax andstamped it with a large seal.Upon the outsideof this package I wrote the contents and directed it to thePresident of the Church in Nauvoo. Besides this I packedhis carpet bag a splendid Buffalo robe worked with Indian beadsovercoat dress coat various other clothing 2 cases of razors two 
 pocketbooks containing deeds of land and other papers a crown piece in a smallpocket book for the Museum at Nauvoo and a variety of other things all of whichI carefully packed to be sent to Nauvoo.A Dream.After retiring to rest this night I fell asleep and dreamt that Ihad just returned to Nauvoo from my English mission and was in companywith a number of the Twelve and other brethren. We met with Josephthe Prophet and I shook hands with him and asked him if he and hisfamily were well. He said they were. I thought the endowmenthad been given and he was counselling us about taking a missionabroad. While talking he sat in a chair and leaned upon his breastHe said he was going to take a mission to India and pointed out theman to go with him but I cannot now call him by name. GeorgeA. Smith asked liberty of Joseph to spend more time with me thatwe might be prepared to take a mission together which was grantedOrson Pratt had his mission appointed but I do not know where;Lyman Wight was spoken of but I do not recollect what was said.We had an interesting time together and all seamed happy tosee the Prophet again.ToombStone of Lorenzo D BarnesI sent to Elder E. F. Sheets the following Epitah for thetoombstone:"In memory of Lorenzo D. Barnes who died on the20th of December 1842 aged 30 years. He was a native of theUnited States an Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints a member of the High Priest Quorum and also ofZions Camp in A.D. 1834 and the first Gospel Messengerfrom Nauvoo who has found a grave in a foreign land. 
 Sleep on Lorenzo but ere long from thisThe conquered toomb shall yeild her captive preyThen with thy Quorum shat thou reign in blissAs King and Priest for an eternal day.The same evening I rode to Newton in companywith Bro James Ferguson and here I stayed with that Branch ofSaints for several days.During my stay at Newton I with severalfriends went to see the Muspratt vitrol works carried on intheir various branches. It is one of the most lucrative businessesin the world but very disagreeable and unhealthy. The fires arefed with brimstone and the smoke of the whole works is carriedoff through a brick chimney 138 feet in circumferance and 396in height and often the air is so impregnated in the dirrectionthat the smoke goes even at a great distance that one canonly with difficulty breathe in it.After leaving these works I visited eachappartment of the Newton Engine factory where a large numberof engines are made for the railroad. We had several of thebrethren at work there who could carry on the business in all its branches.From the Newton Engine Factory Iwalked several miles through a very pleasant scenery surroundedwith green fields hedges trees and gardens and visited the Church. Onthe side of the building was the figure of a pig in stone witha stone hung around its neck. The tradition is that the materialsfor the Church was drawn to another place quite a distancefrom where the Church now stands and the pig came along andtook a stone in his mouth and carried it along squeeling andlaid it down where the Church now stands. The peopletook it as an omen that they should build the Church thereand they did.I returned from my walk to Bro Nuttall's 
 laid hands upon his sick child had prayers with the Saints and departedfor Liverpool.In the beginning of May I visited the Churchesat Preston and Blackburn and with brother Speakman on the 5thI walked from the latter place to Whalley and visited its old Abbeywhich was the largest I had ever been into. It covered several acresof ground & was nearly in total ruins except a small portion of itwhich is inhabited by a few families. The Abbey is 800 yearsold and was built A.D. 1,000.Stoneyhurst—The Jesuits CollegeNext day Brother Speakman and myself walked toStoneyhurst and went through every appartment of the JesuitsCollege which was the only college of the kind in EnglandWe inspected each department of the rare and splendid paintingsand of the library which was very extensive containing manyvery ancient writings and parchment manuscripts. Therewas the prayer book of Mary Queen of England and a copyof St. Paul's Epistles one thousand years old. We wentthrough their museum studies lodgings chapels &c containingmany rare and curious things. There were many paintingsand figures of Christ and some of the images of the Saviouron the cross in fine marble cost £700. We went intothe chapel of the boys educated there and also into the mainchapel one of the windows of which with the paintings of theTwelve Apostles on it cost two thousand pounds andthe candlesticks crosses and all the furnature were very choiceand costly.We visited each part of the gardans which wer devidedby walks bordered by the ewe tree which formed the whole into departments. Thisewe tree border was about 4 feet thick 12 feet high and from 40 to 200 feet longvarying in the departments and these borders were as straight and smooth as aplastered wall. 
 After going through this noted College and its gardenswe walked to Waddington and visited the Almshouses built anddedicated by Sir Robert Parker in 1,700. to the poor widows ofthe parish. There were twenty five dwellings and a smallgarden to each. These houses were occupied by aged widowsthe youngest of whom was sixty years of age and the oldest87. They appeared quite comfortable. We stoped at Waddington for the nightThence next day to Clithero then toChatburn and we walked through the street that the ApostleHeber C. Kimball walked through with his hat off andblessed the place. I felt the Spirit of God rest upon mewhile walking over the same road.A Day at FishingI went fishing the following daywith Father Richard Smithies in the river Ribble. He was70 years of age and was considered the greatest fisherman in that countryHe fished with the fly and it being the first time I had everwitnessed it I was delighted with this ingenious art of fishing andthe dexterity of the fisherman. The fishing rod was about14 feet long very slender and his long fine line made of hair andcatgut was wound round a small brass wheel with a little crank to itand fastened to the but end of the pole. The line then runs throughhalf a dozen brass rings or ilot holes fastened at regular distancesalong the rod to the small end of it. On the line arefive or six artificial flies about two feet apart fastened bycatgut almost as fine as a hair. Twenty or thirty feet of theline is unwound from the reel at the but of the rod and thrownupon the water and the fly hooks swim down the stream andthe trout thaking them as natural flies are hooked assoon as they bite. If they are large trout and run, theyof themselves unwind as much line as they want from thereel and when the fish are thus worried in the water until theystruggle no longer the fisherman draws them to the bankby the line or to himself if he stands in the water and 
 then with a small hand-net on a pole of 5 or 6 feet puts it under the trout & verydeliberatly takes it out of the water. The fishermen have flies varyingfor almost every month imitating the natural flies which swim upon thewater at the time they fish. These flies are made of feathers of birdsof different colours and the trout will often take them before the naturalfly.Father Smithies caught 7 trout and 2 chevenI was much gratified with the days fishing and after our returnSister Parkinson cooked the trout which made a good meal.Clithero Quarterly ConferenceHeld Sunday the 11th of May 1845Elder Speakman was called to preside. The Churches wererepresented some a[l]terations made and officers ordained in the morningIn the afternoon sacrament was administered and the power ofGod rested so abundantly upon the congregation that many weremelted into tears.This is the Conference brother Kimball speaksof in his Journal. I do not wonder that he wept when he leftthem for I was myself so overwhelmed with the spirit and powerof God and simplicity of the people that I could scarcely speakThey were like little children and as pure minded and inocent as angels. Many of them bore their testimony to the work of God.I returned next day to Preston and there metElders Holmes and Hardy and preached at night from the CIIPsalm and on the day after I reached Liverpool.I stayed at home but two days andthen started to attend the Carlisle Conference. I took the steamerfor Carlisle at 4 p.m. on the 15th and as the boat was newly 
 painted from stem to stern and one could not touch ^or sit^ anywhere without carryingaway the paint my last resort was to pay 2 shillings for the use of abunk among the Sailors. I had no sooner gone below than I wasenveloped in the most horrid stench I ever smelt arising from thecargo consisting of goano. I laid down but was as sick as deathand vomitted at intervals for five hours and my stomach being emptyI strained at such a degree that blood ran out of my nose almosta stream. I suffered much through the night and the sailorssmoked their pipes and filled the place with tobaco smoke whichthough nacious to me was better than the stench of the cargo. Ithought it the most horrid night I ever spent at sea.We arrived at Port Carlisle at 9 o'clock inthe morning. I then crossed the ferry and took the canal boat toCarlisle.With brothers Kent and Allen the nextday I went through the town of Carlisle. It was anciently walledin with a high strong wall most of which was taken down inbuilding the city. We walked upon some portion of thewalls which still stood and visited the old St. Marys Church andAbbey about eleven hundred years of age. Portions of the Churchwas the ancient building itself and the remainder had been repairedWe also visited the Carlisle Castle which gave us a fair view ofthe surrounding country and among other things of note with whichwe made ourselves acquainted was a very valuable painting byEdward Rancier which we saw at Mr Charles Thurnum'sStationer's shop. It represented a blacksmith in the act ofshoeing a bay horse with a donkey by his side and a dog sittingon the ground with the tool box anvil tools &c scattered aroundIt was such a life picture that it seemed more than a merepainting. Five thousand pounds had frequently been offeredfor it and refused. They sold the engravings for 5 poundseach and it was supposed that no living artist exceptRancier could paint such a picture. 
 Carlisle ConferenceheldIn the Recabites Lodge Room Castle St. CarlisleSunday May the 18thThis conference had not met before for 4 years andas it was somewhat a special meeting now Elder Woodruff was called tothe chair and Joseph Maughen clerk.The representation showed the conference to consistof the Branches of Carlisle Brampton Alston New Castle Sunderland andDunfries and containing 165 members.The necessary business in putting the Churchesin order was attended to sacrament partaken of and in the eveningthe president of the meeting preached to a crowded house upon the riseand progress of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saintswhich closed the conference.I parted from the Saints of Carlisle andreturned to Liverpool by the same steamer in which I came. It hadon board 400 sheep and some horses and cattle which nearly covered the entiredeck yet the sailors found space large enough to fight on. Abouta dozen of them got at it which left many bloody noses and sore headsWe had a very good passage however.On the 24th of May which was the seventh day of the week and on this the Sabbath day of ancient Israelat 6 o'clock in the morning the last stone was laid on the Templeof the Lord at Nauvoo with shouts of grace unto it. Glory toGod in the Highest who finished his work on the seventh dayand rested. So may the Saints rest! Thus I wrote inmy Journal uponThe Laying of the Last Stone of the Nauvoo Temple. 
 On the 6th of June I started by rail to Londonupon the important Church business of securing the copyright of theBook of Doctrine and Covenants. I left my family in LiverpoolCopyright of the Book of Doctrine & CovenantsSecuredby Wilford Woodruff at Stationers Hall EnglandJune the 7th 1845As refered to elsewhere in my autobiography I had received acopy of a letter from John Greenhow to his father in Englandstating that he was stereotyping the Book of Doctrine and Covenantsup the Chuch at an expence of $300 and that he would be inEngland about the 1st of May when he should strike off afew copies of the book and deprive us of the privilege of printingit. This was to be kept a profound secret but through themercy of God the knowledge fell into my hands and I asthe lawful agent of the Church immediately employed a printerand printed three thousand copies. And on this 7th ofJune I secured the copyright of the Book of Doctrine and Covenantsin my own name at Stationers Hall London and carriedone copy according to law to the British Museum andgot my receipt for it.I spent several weeks in London and whilethere the case of Elder Albon was before the Church. He was theminister of the Indipendant Connection whom we baptized atthe commencement of the work in London on my former missionto England. He was brought to trial for resisting the orderand counsel of the Church and at a meeting on the 19th ofJune when his case was brought up for the last time forsettlement he defended himself with a heart full of envy andaccusation but acknowledged what was brought against him 
 and said that he should continue his course baptizing on [blank] andordaining in his own way. A vote was taken and he was cutoff from the Church a second time.While in London on this occassion I also revisitedmany of the noted places and things of the city and subburbs and sawsome alterations and additions but the most famous of the fresh thingswhich I saw and which I had never visited before wasThe Unrivalled Exhibition of Madame Tussaudand SonsBazar Baker Street Portman SquareI have never in my travels seen anything which couldbegin to compare with this exhibition. On entering I purchassed abook of the contents of each room. Here were life representationsof the kings and queens of England for centuries with their courts at variousperiods, also the kings and emperors of other nations of Europe witha grand marshalling of celebrated poets orators and renowned menof the earth with the due proportion of unenviable notorious charactersAmong the rest stood our own Washington in his dress of state andByron Shakspeare Voltaire Luther Calvin Knox Wesley anda host of like celebrities. And what makes the exhibition sointeresting is the fact that we find there not only the best possiblerepresentations of the persons of the grand array of famous charactersbut also the very dresses &c which they wore in life even to thecoronation robes of royalty with their diamonds stars precious stonesand all the gorgeous paraphernalia of everything famous in thepresent and past. Here is Napoleon the 1st represented underalmost every circumstance of his life and the Sleeping Beautyof France with her jewels and necklace of brilliants with herbosom heaving with the soft regular breathing of sleep looking as naturalas life as does also the other figures. Indeed to such an extent 
 is this life like illusion sustained everwhere in this famous Bazaar thatvisitors often find the novelty of taking these wax figures for livingpersons. I myself was in one case particularly taken in withthe apparant life reality of a respectable old gentleman ^setting^ by myside.

I sat in this carriage in whichthe great Napoleon had sat so many anxious hours and from whichhe gave command in his final battle—Waterloo.

I met withthe Saints that evening in Birmingham.I remained in Birmingham several daysand then went into the Potteries Staffordshire from thence I went toManchester and on the 8th of July returned to Liverpool.On the 18th of the same month my wife Phebegave birth to a fine son to whom I gave the name of Joseph onthe 8th day of his age when I blessed him in the arms of his mother.I continued my Presidential labours in and aroundLiverpool being most of the time in the office until August the22nd when I took the train to Manchester and next day continued 
 to Sheffield where we held conference the next ^following^ day ^&^ returned to Liverpool threedays afterwards were ^Here^ I remained but two days and then attended the Preston Conferenceheld August the 31st and returned again to Liverpool on the 1st of September.On the 6th of this month I forwarded the trunk of ElderLorenzo Barnes to President Young by Elder Houston who went on board of theOregon with a number of others of the Saints.On the 13th with my wife and 2 children I leftLiverpool to attendThe Manchester Quarterly Conferenceheld Sep 14thThere were represented twenty four Branches at this timecomposing the Manchester Conference with a total of one thousand sevenhundred and sixty nine members including 44 Elders 99 Priests 57 Teachersand 27 Deacons. One hundred and fifteen had been baptized duringthe quarter. Most of the Branches were represented in good standingA recommendation was presented to Elder Holmes by the unanimous voteof the Conference and Elder James D. Ross appointed to supply hisplace for the time being as President of the Manchester Conference.We returned to Liverpool on the 16th and receievedletters from my wife's father and brother containing the ^news of the^ death of her motheron the 21st of July aged 70 years 3 months and 13 days. My wife didnot return until two days afterwards. I did not inform her of the deathof her mother intending to let her recover herself from the fatigue of herjourney &c but she found the letters before I informed her and was very muchaffected by the sudden blow.Lemington Conferencewas held Oct the 1st 5th.Myself and Elder Hedlock from Liverpool attended. A good impressionwas made through^out^ the conference upon the minds of a large audienceof respectable citizens notwithstanding that mobs had recently beenraised there who had broken the banisters around the stairs of our 
 meeting place with the benches tables &c.Lemington is one of the first aristocratic towns inEngland which the Nobility and gentry visit as one of their select placesand in consequence of its sulphur springs. The streets and buildingsof the town are rich and splendid in appearance.A Visit to Warwich CastleIn company of about a dozen Saints I visitedthe Warwichk castle and tower. It is considered the most splendidcastle in England and is furnished with all the magnificence which artand the wealth of Earldom could bestow upon it.The main body of the castle was 333 ftlong divided into its various rooms. The walls were hung with richgorgeous tapestry the rooms furnished with the costliest furnitureand the richest damask-covered chairs tables and stands inlaidwith pearl shell and precious stones. Some of these articles cost£15,000 each and would take three years for the artizen to make.This castle contained a great variety ofPaintings and portraits of Kings Queens Lords Orators Reformersand nobles. One among the gallery of portraits was the founder of the Jesuits.From the windows of the castle we lookedout upon stately ceders of Lebanon oak firs and other shrubs andsaw the pleasure grounds of forty acres and a park five miles incircumferance. This castle was 800 years old and the Tower500 years old and 150 feet high. We went to the top of it and had amagnificient view of all the surrounding country.In a small room at the entrance of thecastle we had a view of the armoury of the celebrated GuyHis helmet breastplate and shield weighs 120 pounds and his sword 20 lbs. His copper porage pot holds 120 gallons andsix grown persons of us sat in it at the same time. 
 In the evening I took the train in company with ElderHedlock and rode to Birmingham. On our arrival we found Elder Crookwaiting for us. We accompanied him to the Hall of the Latter-daySaints where we found between 4 and 5 hundred of the saints sittingat a general tea table. As we entered the door the clapping ofhands and stomping of feet that welcomed us made the room trembleand it was with difficulty that I could get to the stand as all wished toshake hands with me as I passed along.After taking a repast with this warm heartedband of brethren and sisters I addressed them for about the space ofan hour clothed with the Spirit and power of God. I was followed byElder Hedlock and we spent a good time together.Next day I left Birmingham for LiverpoolOn the 14th and 15th of the month in Liverpool I satwith the board of Directors of the British and American Joint StockCompany until near midnight of the second day. It was a hard day'swork and a critical one. Each article of the deed for settlementpreparing for regestration was read over several times changed andaltered as the Board of Directors thought fit.It had been with much labour care andexpence to get the Joint Stock Company settled so as to begin todo business and during the day I had many trying things toencounter. My spirit was greived and insulted as it had been manytimes since I came to Liverpool from a source that I oughtto have expected better things.We got the Nauvoo Times and Neighborand New York Messenger informing us of the commencing of mobingonce more in Hancock County. The mob had burned 42 housesof the Saints in Lima; and a day or two later the Liverpoolpapers teemed with rumours that mobs were raging againstthe Saints in Hancock Co. had burned severed hundred of theirhouses and that a proposition had been made by the Twelveto the citizens of Hancock County for the Mormons to leave ^that they would leave the State as soon as they could dispose of their property^ 
 Proclamation of the Twelve Apostles[13 lines blank]On the 24th I met with Elders Hedlock and Wardand laid before them my feelings concerning our situation inLiverpool both temporally and spiritually. There had notbeen a good understanding between us for some time but I toldthese brethren what I wished to be done and seemingly ourmeeting was profitable and at the close of our consultation webowed our knees together before God.Towards the latter end of the follow[ing] month I received intelligence from President Young thatthe State of Illinois would not protect the citizens of Nauvooand that the only terms of peace granted at all was upon conditionof our people leaving the State. The Presidency of the Church andthe community themselves had been under the necessity of agreeingto leave the State of Illinois the next Spring. I wrote in return to President Young expressing my feelings severely uponthis extermination of the Saints and asked his counsel whetherI should tarry in England or return to America. I also senthim a duplicate of the entering of the copyright of the 
 Books of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants.I also notified the Presiding Elders of the British mission of a Special General Conference to be held at Manchesteron the 14th day of December 1845.I then left Liverpool and attended the GlasgowConference held sunday October ^Novem^ the 30th and returned again to Liverpoolon the 3rd of December and on the 13th with Mrs WoodruffI took train to Manchester.Special General Conferenceof theBritish Missionheld atThe Hall of Science Manchester Dec. 14, 1845.The conferences of the British Mission were representedcontaining a total of eleven thousand and thirty two memberswith one of the quorum of the Twelve 8 High Priests 392 Elders590 Priests 311 Teachers and 188 Deacons and 1573 baptized duringthe last eight months. The statistics of the StaffordshireConference was not included in this total.Thus had the work of God in the BritishIsles in a few years grown into a mighty mission.This Special Conference was continuedthrough two days and much important business was taken upand arrangements made in view of my return to the United Statesand ^and^ the emigration expulsion of the Saints and the general affairs ofthe mission discoursed upon.I spent the day following the Conferencewith the Saints an Manchester and bid them farewell andnext day returned to Liverpool.

I gave out of this 12 poundsto Elder ClarkOn the evening of the 10th I madea feast for a few of the brethren before my departure 
 and had for my guests Elders Hedlock Ward Clark Wilson and Downes.Next day was Sunday and the last but oneof my stay in England on this mission. I communed with the Saintsand delivered in the evening my farewell address.The following week was a very busy onein preparing for our own emigration and the sending off of a smallcompany of the Saints.On the 16th I went on board of the ShipLiverpool with my family and about 40 others of the Saints. EldersHedlock Fielding McChacie and myself ^I and^ went out with the ship tenmiles and I then parted with my family and the company of Saintson board and returned with the above ^several^ brethren in a small boat toLiverpool for I could not go for some days but had to leave mywife and children to cross the Atlantic without me and tarrymyself for some days to settle my business and the affairs of themission.As the 21st was the last day of my timeon shore I was determined to make some settlement of my affairsbefore going on board of the ship and this I had found hard toaccomplish. Elders Ward and Hedlock had so much business oftheir own to do that they had done but little to help me in thesettlement of mine and what they should have done had beenput off by them to the last minute. This made it very hard for me. I had to pull along alone and none to help and ElderWard especially had manifested great indifference and neglect towardsme. However I struggled through it by the help of God and also overthrew a design to partly rob me of the little means I hadThis design I had every reason to believe was concockted by MrJames the Printer and a professed friend standing near me in office and interest.But I succeeded this day in effecting a finalsettlement and the statement showed that I left the printing department of the Church with property in excess of debts

 the people it was the last meeting I should hold with them for a season, it created much excitement. I had appointments out for a week, which I got Bro. Cordon to fill. I went before the Lord in prayer and asked him where I should go, the Spirit said, go to the south. According to the directions of the Spirit, on the 3rd March I went to Herefordshire, and called uponJohn Benbow at Castlefroom; here I found a people prepared for the Gospel. I preached twice at his house. On the 6th I baptized 6 persons including John Benbow and wife. I here found a society called "United Brethren," numbering about six hundred members, and about 50 preachers, Thos. Kington was the presiding Elder; they came from all quarters to hear me preach and believed my testimony and I preached and baptized daily; the Ministers of the Church of England sent three church clerks to see what I was doing and I baptized them. One constable came to arrest me for preaching, and I baptized him. In about 30 days days I baptized 160, forty eight of which ^whom^ were preachers of the United Brethren including their presiding Elder, Thomas Kington.I established forty two preaching places licensed according to law.On the 9th April I had an appointment at HawCross, as I was going into the meeting, letters were put into my hands from Elder Brigham Young and others informing me of his arrival with five of the Twelve,and requested me to come to Preston, and attend a general conference,— a vast assembly had gathered atto attend my meeting, the house, yard and street wasere crowded, a mob had also gathered; I preached to the people, five came forward and wished to be baptized 
 the mob surrounded the pool, armed with stones, I dismissed the meeting and went away, but the congregation and mob remained on the ground till midnight, and as there was no prospect of their dispersing and the candidates were anxious to be baptized, I went down in to the water and baptized five in the mist of a shower of stones,the water was all in a foam for a rod around me,none that I baptized were hit, and I was only hit twice, once on my hip and once on my head, the one ^blow^ on my head raised a large bump, it which went away whileI was confirming: S^s^ubsequently I baptized many of the mob.Subsequently I left next morning for Preston and attended the conference with the Twelve, and returned to Hereforshireaccompanied by Elder Brigham Young, on the 22nd April, and was soon joined by Elder Willard Richards. Elder Young remained with me twenty seven days, preaching,baptizing, confirming and counciling; numbers were added daily to the church: he then returned to Manchester.I spent about seven months in Herefordshire, Glo^uce^stershire and Worcestershire, we baptized over eighteen hundred including all of the United Brethren save one: we baptized over two hundred preachers of various denominations in that part of the vinyard[line through remainder of page] 
 A synod of church ministers became so alarmed for their flocks in that part of the vineyard, they petitioned parliament to adopt some measures to stop our preaching, they got ^received^ for an answer, that if they were as well acquainted with the Bible as their hunting grounds, and were as much interested in the welfare of the souls of men, as the chasing of the stags and foxes, they would not loose so many of their congregations.Aug. 18th, I visited London in company with Elders H.C. Kimball and G. A. Smith, I labored with them in establish-ing a church, spending over 5 months in that populous city.We visited nearly every part of the city, and all the notable places that we could have access to.I attended all the general conferences in England,and set sail with my brethren of the Twelve on the ship, Rochester April 20, 1841— arrived in New York May 20,.I went to Scarborough, Maine, got ^after^ my wife, and also ^also^ my son, Wilford, whom I had not before seen, he was born March 22, 1840. My daughter Sarah Emma had died July 17, 1840.I returned to New York and started for Nauvoo, via the Lakes, was wrecked on Lake Michigan in the steamer Chesapeake, but arrived in Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6 1841, when I had the happy privilege of meeting with the Prophets Joseph and Hyrum, and my brethren of the Twelve.I bought a log house of brother Tracy, on Lot No 1,Block 106, on Hotchkiss and Durffee Streets, Prest Joseph Smith afterward,s gave me the Lot.I spent ^the^ winter of 1841–2, attending meetings councils and laboring with my hands, I attended the Nauvoo House provision Store until the 3rd Feby. 1842,when I take took charge of the ^business department of the^ printing office inconnection with Elder John Taylor.On the 5th of March, [blank] ^my Daughter, Phebe, Amelia, was born.Sept 24th The Printing office took fire in the upper story in the midst of a large amount of paper, and itcame near burning up. was with difficulty extinguished. 
 X' July 5, 1848, (while on a mission to the Eastern States)I drove my carriage, containing myself and family into the door yard ofbro. James Williams in Iowa, to camp for the night; I tied my mules to alarge oak tree several rods from the carriage; as we were about to lay downin the carriage for the night, I was strongly impressed to go and move mymules from the oak tree, and also to move my carriage; I followed thedictates of the Spirit, and removed my mules to a small hickory grove,also moved my carriage several rods, and retired to rest.In a short time a heavy rain storm came on, which brokethe tree near the ground, and laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood,as it was, the top struck the hind end of the carriage; the tree was2 feet in diameter; thus, by obeying the whisperings of the spirit, myselfand family were preserved.

 (*2nd, Page 6th paper apart)On the 5 day of Oct 1846 while with the Camp of Israelbuilding up Winter Quarter on the west side of the MissouriRiver then Indian Country I passsed passed through one of the mostpainful scenes of my life and serious misfortune of any of my lifeI took my ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the bluffs to cut some shingletimber to cover my cabin I was acompanied by two other men andwhile falling the third tree ^which was an oak over two feet in diameter^ I steped backed of it some 8 feet and also oneside about the same distance where I thought I was entirely out of dangerbut when the tree fell (being over two feet in diameter) ther being a crookin the body of it, it struck a knowl on the ground and the whole body of the treeshot end ways back of the stump and bounded & the but of the tree struckme in the breast and knocked me several in the air against a standingOak and the falling tree followed me in its bend and caught meagainst the standing tree and I came down between ^the two trees^ them onestanding & the other falling but before reaching the ground I wasliberated from between them and struck the ground upon my feet.It badly bruised my left thigh the whole leangth of it and my hipalso my left arm it also broak my breast bone into also 3 ribson my left side it also bruised my lungs, vitals, and left side ina shocking manor. After the accident I sat upon a log untillMr John Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horse. Notwith-standing I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ride2 1/2 miles over a very rough road and had to dismout twice inconsequence of miry places, my breast and vitals was so badly tornto peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an arrowI continued on horsback untill I arived at Turky Creek on theNorth side of Winter Quarters I then became exhausted & was takenoff and carried in a chair to my waggon not having a ^my^ cabin builtI was met in the street by president Brigham Young H. C Kimball, WRichards & others who assisted in carrying me to my family. Before lyingme upon my bed the presidency laid hands upon me rebuked my suffering& distress in the name of the Lord and said I should live andnot die. I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon and asthe Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live andnot die. I employed no physician on this occasion but was administered 
 to by the Elders of Israel and nursed by my wife I lay uponmy bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to nittogether which commenced on the 9th day I began to walk about in20 days from the time I was hurt and in 30 days from the time I washurt I again commenced hard labour. And It has alwaysappeared miraculous to me that with all the injuries and broken bonesthat I have had, I have not a lame limb about me but havebeen enabled ever since to endure the hardest manual labor,exposure, hardships and injuries have even walked 40, 50 & on one occasion60 miles in a day. However if I over labor or take a severe cold Ifeel it more sensibly in my breast and left side than I didbefore my last injury.  Thus I have occupied considerable space inreferring to those peculiar circumstances which here attending me ^thus far^ during lifeand to sum the matter up it stands about thus. I have broakenboth legs (one twice in two) both arms, both ancles, my breast bone,3 ribs, have been drowned, froze, & scalded. have been in twowater wheels under a full head of water, bitten by a mad dogand passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes. Yet themercies of God have been over me, and my life has thus farbeen preseved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to renderthe gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my HeavenlyFather praying that the remainder of my days, may be spentin his service & the building up of his Kingdom(Page 9th * History) Having embraced the fullness of the Everlasting Gospel ofJesus Christ and seeing in it great beauty, power, glory & salvationI had a great ^great^ desire to teach it to my ^the gospel fellow men, and thisdesire increased upon me and rested with great wait upon mymind but ^which^ I did not reveal this to any man ^person^. But one Sundayevening I retired into the woods alone by myself and called uponthe Lord in earnest prayer to open my way to go and preachthe gospel of Salvation to the children of men ^inhabitants of the Earth^. The Spirit of theLord rested upon me & bore witness unto me that my prayer washeard & should be answered upon my head. I arose from myknees happy & walked some forty rods through a thick wood intoan open road, as I entered the road there stood before meJudge Elias Higby an High Priest with whom I had been 
 closely associated having ^and^ lived in the same house for a numberof months but had never to my recollection said any thing to meabout preaching or ordination. But now as I approached himhe said Brother Wilford the Spirit of the Lord tells me that youshould be ordained & go and preach the gospel ^on a mission^. I said very wellif it is the will of the Lord I am ready.At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights Clay County Missourion the 5th day of Nov 1834 I was ordained to the office of a priest by thedirections of the High Council under the hands of Brother Simeon CarterStephen Winchester & Heman Hyde were ordained priests at the same time.I called upon Bishop Edward Partridge and asked him what mymission should be in what part of the country I should go to preachthe gospel. He replyed that I should ^Bishop Partridge said he would^ like to have some of the Brethren ^me^ go intothe Southern States through Arkansas Tennesee Kentucky &c if I could findany body who had faith enough to go ^with me^ for it would be a hard missionand a hard ^dangerous^ county to travel in at present in consequence of the Missouripersecutions. I told him I was as ready to go South as any where else if hewished it. As Arkansas lay South of Missouri I asked him if Ishould go through Jackson County as it lay direct in our path ^route^ he saidit would be at the risk of ones life & I have not got faith enough toundertake it if you have you can try it, I asked him if I wentthrough Jackson County if I should start without purse or scrip as ingeneral terms that seemed ^according^ to be the law ^of God^. He said that he had not gotfaith enough to start on a mission through Jackson County without moneyand if I dare it I must do it on my own faith. As the commandmentsrequired the Elders to go out without purs or scrip I felt strenous to keepthe commandments so I ^started without money^ resolved that to go without purse or scrip I wished to have some companion go with my ^up^ on my mission I didnot wish to launch forth into the open world alone. I called uponElder Harry Brown (who had accompanied me from Richland New York to Clay CoMissouri) and asked him if he would not accompany me it met hiswishes and Bishop Partridge gave him his mission with me. Andwe immediately ^prepared^ ourselves to start upon our journey And on the 13th day of Jan1835 I recieved the following recommend in connexion with my priests license((Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, Jan 13 1835 This certifies that Wilford Woodruffhas faithfully discharged evry duty required of him in the Camp of the Saintson the 13 day Jan 1835 I received an honorable discharge from Lyman Wight fromthe duties of Zions Camp and

 Salt Lake City: March 10, 1888.Prest Woodruff and Brethren of the Presidency.Dear Brethren:The difficulties which now beset the inauguration of the business I represent vary very considera-bly from the physical difficulties which have been met and overcome, and for help have come them I now earnestly appealto you. I readily recognize, and I feel keenly, the difference in the circumstances of the true friends of the people before and after the commencement of the "Grand Steal". Heretoforethe establishment of an industrial enterprise for the benefit of our people has been much more easily reached than it canpossibly be at the present time, because, with the will thepeople's best friends had the means to assist with thelubricating element of money as well as influence and friendship.Now money is out of the question but influence and friendshipand the power to use them remain.The element which has brought about this important changehas dammed up the source and turned the channels and cur-rents of fertilizing means from where they could be used for prac-tical benefits, into courses barren of good results, and have thesepartially paralysed the hand of material assistance, and now to keep as much as possible absolute control out of the hands ofiminical and paralysing power seems to be the great desideratum;to do this I appeal to you for your help and counsel. 
 There is no longer question with regard to the profitableness of the busi-ness I represent; the profits, to say the least of them, will be veryconsiderable from the beginning and the business properly managedwill assume magnificent proportions, and in a few years those whocontrol it will be in the front ranks of our finiancial world. Wisemanipulation, prudent counsel, and competent assistance rightnow will in all probability secure this control. He who feels interestedfor the welfare of this people would feel very much chagrined, to havelevied upon them, when employed profitably & remuneratively in this business,a monthly tribute for the support of the "loyal league" or to see themsuperseded by Chinamen, or worse the lowlived tramps and apostateswho are enlisted in the Devil's forces, or to have this magnificentfinancial power wielded for the crushing out of the last vestige of freedom and liberty left to us. God has not only prepared andpreserved but he has given to us this country; He has blessed the soil, increased the water, made the elements conducive to fertility,withheld the frost, advanced the seasons, and made this portion of hiscreation ^beautiful and enviable, and^, at our solicitation and to gratify our pleasure, and to make ourhomes pleasant and desirable He has given us the wisdom and the energy to develop the resources of our mountain land. Shall we easily and without consideration and effort allow any portion of the control of these choice blessings to pass out of our possession?The business I represent grapples with the outspending of oneand a half millions a year; it means the employment of overa thousand hands, and the manipulation of the vast wealththat will inevitably accumulate around this nucleus. Shallour people control this and have the power to employ God's people

It is probably neither desirable nor possi-ble to entirely exclude outside capital but to keep it in the minority is the object to be attained, and to hold the reins of power now isthe time for consideration and forethought and to plan to retain thatwhich will be a great blessing to keep and it appears to me would be a misfortune, if not actually a sin, on our part, to lose.Your kind sympathy with the enterprise, your desire for itssuccess, your counsel concerning the course to pursue, and general fostering interest for ^in^ its development, will be invalua-ble factors in its prosperity and securing its control, and are most earnestly and respectfully solicited.Very respectfully Your brotherArthur Stayner.

 Salt Lake City, Utah;June 15th 1889.Presidents Woodruff, Cannon & Smith:Dear Brethren:Permit me to respectfully lay before you the following reflec-tions upon the result of my interview yesterday:  It is now nearlynine years since I first conceived the idea of building up the Sugarindustry in Utah.  Faithfully, ploddingly and patiently I have centralizedmy efforts upon that one object and have allowed nothing to stand inthe way of its accomplishment.  No sacrifice has been too great, no jeopardytoo venturesome, no reasonable consideration too precious to reach the desiredend.  Everything I possessed or could control, savings, earnings, credit,comfort, pleasure, home itself have been placed upon the altar andimmolated like Palissy's furniture to reach the blessing proposed.  IfI had failed and wasted my time and labor on an unprofitable under-taking fruitless of profitable result I would be willing to accept the reward ofa fool should have, but with all the benefits, social, political and financialwhich belong to the business I have labored in plainly in sight, I may beforgiven if my heart is heavy with disappointment at the result of the interviewyesterday.  Let the intense interest I feel in this matter plead excuse for mein asking respectfully this question; Are there not some means of reaching a subscrip-tion of $3000 -- being $1000 each & paying 10% thereof, to manifest for this enterprisea recognition by the Presidency of this.

Wilford WoodruffDear Brother:Very respectfully I submit the following:I have the opportunity of purchasing certain landson the Provo Bench, (the point which I have selected as themost suitable to establish the first plantation and factoryfor sugar) surrounding, or contiguous to, two sections of University lands, costing something less than $15000$—an average of $1700 per acre; also of purchasing for $10,000the water right of the Provo Woollen Mills, sufficient to irrigate 5000 acres. By purchasing this land I cansecure the two sections of University land. An Easternparty is trying to secure these very lands in orderto introduce a colony of strangers upon that very sectionof country.With a little help from you I can securethis location. The brethren who have promisedmoney on the Sugar industry will [keep] their promises 
 if they can see that you are willing to sustain theenterprise, And sufficient money will be forthcomingto carry the business successfully on if I can get thefirst step taken aright.You have assisted banking, merchandising, and wagon setting firms with your potential influence, and the principle of production modestly asks for your sanctionand support. Respectfully I urge that the Sugar industryis second to none in importance, in profit, in practicability,in power and in influence. In 6 years after commencementit will empty 1000 hands, and its output of productionbe ($1000,000$) a million dollars annually. It will employ10,000 acres of land and 10 factories. If we are to stayhere, is this not a matter of importance to secure? Willit not be a cement under our feet,? will it not fastenthe hearts and interests of people here, establish firmly theirhomes and if we secure the control will not the peopleemployed be friends and not enemies?A small subscription from you with the moral supportof the name of some of the leading brethren on the Directorywill secure these things.It is now too late to plant for this season, but thereis yet time to secure the land and water in questionand the prospective benefits of the magnificent industry.

S. I await your reply per Brohand Bro SudburyA Stayner3 pm WednesdyNov 320 [18]89 
 I assure you in the most solemn manner that thebusiness will be a success, unless Providence passesa special act against it. If we do not do it some-body else will just as the Provo bench and universitylands will be secured by strangers if we do not secure itright now.Your sanction and approval and influence witha few thousand dollars will do this. I find that thosewho promised support hang on your action to a great extent,and much difficulty will arise, and consequent delayif your favorable action is delayed, but if you grantit every thing is planned and ready for immediateaction. We can plow up the land ready for next year,build the houses and stables, plant lucern fields, makethe water ditches and secure the success of the undertaking,all with about $30,000$ which I know I can get as fast as I want it. I am offered one quarter section of the land and three thousand dollars worth of teams or stockjust as soon as I get started. 
 With these interests at stake and consequent anxiety I feel that you will excuse my apparent importunity, which may have appeared unseemly. The first year's profits of $40,000 have passed away, it is too late now to think of them,but mby moving now what I have stated can be secured.The party intending or trying to purchase the Provo Benchhas gone to Colorado & will return next week, he says withthe money, therefore I respectfully ask your early and favorable action hereon.Very respectfullyYour brother in the GospelArthur Stayner 
 great people? The President of the Church subscribes $1000to build a mill in Idaho, benefitting a few score of settlers there,cannot he also subscribe $1000, and each of his Counsellors subscribe$1000, paying 10% thereof, to build up this great industry forthe whole people in Utah? It is too much, I amaware, to ask of you personally, not being capitalists, but ina matter of ^such^ general benefit and importance is it unrea-sonable that out of means under your control so smallan amount as $300 might be obtained to give the toneof recognition and confidence to so worthy an undertaking?I have secured many good friends to the industrywho are ready to show their confidence by their payments,but it is me that some of the men who have become rich hereand claim to be financiers have not as yet yieldedtheir tangible sympathy and interest to the enterprise. They claim, by virtue of their success no matter by what methods produced, the right to stand aloof and look supercili-ously down, from their supposed point of vantage, upon thelabours and propositions of other men and they claim theright of judging other men's capabilities by standardsof their own raising, and I have proved that they arenot above the abject meanness of wresting from a temporarilyexhausted workesr the benefit of his labour and using the develop-ment which is the result of his exertion without due and proper

I readily recognize, and I feel keenly, the difference inthe circumstances of the true friends of the people before andafter the commencement of the "Grand Steal". Heretoforethe establishment of an industrial enterprise for the benefit ofour people has been much more easily reached than it canpossibly be at the present time, because, with the will thepeople's best friends had the means to assist with thelubricating element of money as well as influence and friendship.Now money is out of the question but influence and friendshipand the power to use them remain.The elemebt which has brough about this important changehas dammed up the sourse and turned the channels and cur-rents of fertilizing means from where they could be used for prac-tical benefits, into courses barren of good results, and have thuspartially paralysed the hand of material assistance, and now tokeep as much as possible absolute control out of the hads ofinimical and paralysing power secues to be the great desideratiun;to do this I appeal to you for your help and counsel.

One of these branches is the producing and man-ufacturing, the other one is the trading and speculative.A very little experience and reflection will enable one to de-termine the relative qualifications requisite for the represen-tatives of the two branc[h]es. While each should possess energyand vim, and be thoroughly imbued with the spirit ofhis work, the one may be of slower thought and tempera-ment than the other but must possess that dogged per-severance and invincible pertinacity of purpose that knowsno surrender; he must also possess to a marked degreethe virtue of patience which will enable him to watch theslow developing of experiment and which, if he does notreach success at one trial, will inspire him to look forward 
 payment therefor, and they presume to set up their indepen-dent ladders on the platforms he has raised in order to pluckthe fruit which he has planted, when it ripens. They presumeto interpret my temporarily exhausted condition into ^lack of^ capacitybecause they do not comprehend the self devotion whichinspires one to spend his last dollar and jeopardise hisevery interest to produce other than the most selfishresults. There is no more justice in this course than in theattitude of the United States in robbing this people of theirproperty, and I appeal to the highest authority God has onthe Earth for protection against the possibility of anything like such an outrage.The words of one of the brethren addressed to Bro Morris and myself a few weeks ago are ringing in my ears becausethey so truly re-echo the sentiments of my heart, "Is itpossible that we cannot do anything for the benefitof the people without the Bank corner"? My sympathywith this sentiment has rendered me somewhat indifferentabout courting their influence. While I do not desireto antagonize them I am not willing to bow, just becausethey have got money, to men who have no higher concep-tion of a business than the sordid consideration of howmuch money there is in it for themselves.It is a generally received axiom that to appreciate the 
 beauty and sublinity of poetry is the very next akin to beingthe poet who produces them, so it may well be said that toappreciate the labours of self sacrifice is to be the possessorof the self devotion necessary to its accomplishment. Uponhearts unable to appreciate, the devoted labours of a lifetimefall as down upon adamant, and the recognition of sucha life, be it rewarded or unrequited, depends upon thehonor and sensitiveness of the community who are thebeneficiaries of the work.I appeal to you, brethren, for further, and I trust morefavorable, consideration for I lay this matter at yourfeet as the servants of God nearest to Him, and I[illegible] ^hesitate^ to take it up again unless blessed and imbuedwith your respect and influence.Very respectfully submittedby your brother in the GospelArthur StaynerP.S.

 of these two powerful elements it diffuses benefits to themany while its kindred branch benefits only the few. Anillustration of this principle is seen by analyzing andcomparing Z.C.M.I., one of the noblest & praiseworthy institutionsof the trading branch, with some of the manufacturing estab-lishments in our community.ZCMI with a capital of one million dollars sells3¼ million of goods a year; of this amount there is kepthere for circulation $200,000 wfor wages, $100,000 for dividendand probably $50,000 more for reserve fund, in all say$350,000, the remainder, nearly three millions, is shovelledout of the Territory just as fast and as completely as it canpossibly be done; this money goes to pay operatives 2000or 3000 miles away for doing things, many of which someof our unemployed people, if properly organized, could,& would be glad to, do; and with this capital this Institutionemploys only one hand to each $8000, pays out wagesequal to only 20% and earns including reserve fund15%, while the shoeshop and tannery occupyingonly one eighth as much capital, saves for circulationone half as much money, pays out for wages anamount equal to 50% of its capital and employs twohands to the $1000 or sixteen times as many handsas ZCMI does to the same amount of capital; yet 
 There is no longer question with regard to the profitableness of the busi-ness I represent; the profit, to say the least of them, will be veryconsiderable from the beginning and the business properly managedwill assure magnificent proportions, and in a few years those whocontrol it will bei n the front ranks of our financial world. []manipulation, prudent counsel, and competent assistance rightnow will in all probability secure this control. He who feels interestedfor the welfare of this people would feel very much chagrined, to havelevied upon them, when employed profitably & remuneratively in this business,a monthly tribute for the support of the "loyal league" or to see themsuperseded by Chinamen, or worse the [loralived] tramps and apostateswho are enlisted in the Devil's forces, or to have this magnificentfinancial power wielded for the crushing out of the last vestige offreedom and liberty left to us. God has not only prepared andpreserved but he has given to us this country; He has blessed thesoil, increased the water, made the elements conducive to fertility,withheld the frost, advanced the seasons, and made this portion of hiscreation ^beautiful and enviable, and^, at our solicitation and to gratify our pleasure and to make ourhomes pleasant and desirable He has given us the wisdom and theenergy to develop the resources of our mountain alnd. Shall weeasily and without consideration and effort allow any portion of thecontrol of these choice blessings to pass out of our possession.?The business I represent grapples with the outspending of oneand a half millions a year; it means the employment if overa thousand hands, and the manipulation of the vast wealththat will inevitably accumulate around this nucleus.

 this shoeshop is capable of supplying this people onlyone pair of shoes each every sixteen months, thus showingample room for four or five more factories of like capacity.Thus it can be seen that ZCMI, with its one manufacturingoffspring occupying only one eighth of its capital, is doingnearly as much good to the community as it is doingwith the other seven eighths in the mercantile department,and it is a matter worthy of notice and germain to myargument that this one issue together with a small branchfor making overalls and jumpers is the only manufacturingdevelopment ^of Z.C.M.I^ in twenty years of its existence, and it canbe safely averred that it would not now exist but for theintelligent perseverance of Wm H. Lowe. I mention thisand call particular attention to it to show that theclass of men necessary to manage successfully amercantile institution like ZCMI, cannot be expectedto evolve from the crude elements the productions upon which depend the employment of labour and thetrue prosperity and tangible wealth of the people.A striking illustration of the principle I wish to substantiateis found in the incorporation of the Utah Commercial Banklast week. Capital to the amount of $200,000 was subscribedat short notice for this undertaking, but what benefit willit be to the people? That $200,000 will employ not to exceed 
 friends' to do this work or shall our unfriends control it and infusean element into it that will build up the oppositey kingdom.?The kindly assistance of your consideration, counsel, and influence will secure this control; by your active advice and friendship forthis enterprise, the Cooperative stores and brethren who havemoney and lack only a little inspiritng influence to give themthe fortitude to embark some of their means in so worthy andprofitably and enterprise, a preponderance at least of mormoncapital can be secured. It is probably neither desirable nor possi-ble to entirely exclude outside capital but to keep it in the minorityis the object to be attained, and to hold the reins of power now isthe time for consideration and forethought and to plan to retain thatwhich will be a great blessing to keep and it appears to mewould be a misfortune, if not actually a sin on our part, to lose.Your kind sympathy with the enterprise, your desire for itssuccess, your counsel concerning the course to pursue, andgeneral fostering interest for^in^ its development, will be invalua-ble factors in its prosperity and securing its control, and aremost earnestly and respectfully solicited.Very respectfullyYour brotherArthur Stayner. 
 five or six persons or one hand to $35000 or $40000, whichmeans that the shoe shop industry will employ 70 to 80times as many hands as this Bank will to the same amountof Capital, and is it not a reasonable surmise that whilethe spirit of Banking and kindred speculations prevails therewill be plenty of money to advance the interests of the few,yetbut it looks as though the Devil may have the many. Thatbanks are, as animated safes, necessary and convenient insti-tutions is conceded but from what source do they maketheir money? They produce nothing, they manufacturenothing, but they simply take their profits from other people'searnings, by lending A's money to B and keeping the interestthat B pays for the use of it.It is indispensable that such institutions as ZcmI andsome other kindred financial concerns should exist, andthat they are represented and manipulated by men of nobleprobity and marked intelligence is a source of congratulationto the community, but that they exist in so notable a prepon-derance over the producing and manufacturing branch of thefinancial power is a palpable evidence of faultyutilization of the principles of political and domestic economy.There can exist no reasonable doubt in the mind of anystatesman, having the true interests of his people in view,that there is great superiority in the beneficent policy of

 legislating and planning for the benefit of the many, whilepreserving and protecting the rights of the few.A clearcut and palpable evidence substantiatingthe proposition I have laid down with regard to the differenceof talent and qualification necessary for the two separate branchesis found in the statement made by one of the committeemento whom had been entrusted investigation into the meritsof the sugar industry, when he said "I cannot grasp thedetails of a producing or manufacturing business but ifyou will make your sugar I will buy it & sell it." Thisexpression showing the absence of interest in or comprehensionof anything pertaining to the producing interests seemedto voice the sentiments of the whole committee and gavetone to their report which recommended a disastrousdelay, whereas a few drops of the vivifying elixir, withoutwhich production & manufacture would ever be a failure,would have inspired a searching inquiry, elicited attract-ive information, and engendered an interest that wouldhave culminated in a thorough investigation and givenus the fruition of the enterprise some time earlier.How true it is that the safe conservatisue that declinesto move lest it fail is the dry-rot of life.It certainly should be readily conceded that one ofthe most valuable aids to the solid and tangible pros-

They are making a smalleroutput this year than I used to make with my old milling and open process, and only little more than one half of what they got last year for the whole season's average.Consequently as the beet manufacture is so much of a success, and the results elicited at our late Fair are sosatisfactory with regard to the saccharine in our beets,it is not worth while to argue for the Sorghume althoughit can be plainly shown that the conditions, climate,market, and protection by freight are so much more 
 perity of a community is the motive that inspires one notonly to run some risk but to be willing to make somesacrifice for the development of the crude resources of thecountry, and the evolution of industries in which greatprospective good lies dormant. In the introductionof all new producing and manufacturing enterprises,no matter how skilfully managed nor what prestigethey may bear upon their front, there is a feature ofadventure or apparent risk which calls for nerve andgood judgment and staying qualities born of determinedmotive. Between the inception and the consummationof any enterprise designed for the transformation of thecrude elements into the practical and material necessariesand comforts of life, there exists a hiatus, in the bridgingof which many a valuable and well-intentioned designdies the death of inanition, so many there are who usejust enough fuel to make the water hot but withholdthe last few bushels of coal necessary to raise the steamto a working pressure. The "one more day" for whichColumbus contended with his ignorant and mutinouscrew was the most valuable of all his days, for itprevented the loss of his entire undertaking and gaveto the world the fulfilment of the Almighty's purpose, andwithout that one day all his previous years of toil were a

In the presence of so many implied doubts on the part of my friends, it would appear self-willed and, perhaps, foolishly head-strong, on my part, to persist in an undertaking of so great conse-quence and magnitude, as the one concerning which I have writtenyou. May I not intrude upon your time to lay before you, in brief, some of the palpable reasons which have induced me to undertake so great a labor?I commenced, nearly eight years ago, to search for some business of production that would relieve the over-burdened ranks of the Farmers, and occupy their attention in some direction wherein they would cease to compete against each other in the production of Wheat. I saw that ranks of the farmers were over-burdened with the number of persons who did not legitimately belong there. Many thousands of Tradesmen of various kinds had come here to live. They could not find the employment which had hbeen their means of support up to the time of leaving the Old Countries; and, rather than accept

Their lack of skill obliged them to raise the crop most easily produced,—Wheat;and their necessities compelled them to be the first in the marketwith what they had to sell. Thus, the legitimate farmer was power-less in maintaining reasonable and paying prices for his product.And, so long as there was an excess of supply over demand, prices ruled low and no one was well paid. Hence the necessity of opening up some other branch of the industry upon which the farming labor might be employed; in addition to this reason, there also appeareda still greater one: that a large number of our people are unem-ployed; that is, failed in securing continuous employment; and whilemany were not profitably employed, many others were not employed at all, and many of our young men, who, failing to find work at home, are forced to look for employment in Mining Camps and other places away from the care of parents.In looking about, then, for a channel into which to direct the labors of the farming community and others unemployed, I noticed that we paid out annually a very vast sum for the article of Sugar,

HARDY, Eng[ineer]. & Sup[erintenden]t.Office of the SALT LAKE and FORT DOUGLAS RAILWAY,EAGLE GATE.Salt Lake City, Utah,and thought that if we could succeed in producing here the sugar that we used, the prolblem was solved, for the time at least.About this time, word reached me that the government was makingsome experiments, looking into the manufacture of sugar from sorghumand I conceived the idea that it would be a good thing to test,simultaneously, the capability of the climate and the soil of Utah, to produce crystalizable sugar; and I concluded that if the exper-iments of the government, in other places, proved successful, it wouldbe well for us to know wheither or not it were possible for us to obtain the benefits of the success; knowing that it is frequently quite as great an advanteage to know what you can not do, as to know what you can do.With this object in view, eight years ago, I commenced theseexperiments. Perhaps, if had consulted my friends and sought their advice at that time, I might have been with-held from running the risks and performing the difficulties and arduous tasks which I set myself; but, I did not do so, ans, consequently, no one else but myself is to blame, or is responsible for the truoubles and anxietieswhich I have passed through. And I blame no one; but I am thankfulto say that the conception of the idea has not been barren of re-sult. I now know, not only what I can not do, but I know what I can do; and, as I have before had an opportunity of telling you, I have

 facture, therefore I respectfully urge an immediaterequest.I further respectfully urge that I make no appli-cation for financial aid, and unless you are perfectlywilling to take this matter under your tutelaryguardianship upon receiving Bro Howe's report, all I will ask of you is the permission to use his report inconfirmation of my representations of the possible and probablebenefits and profits of the undertaking.I have conversed with Bro Howe and upon yourrequest he is perfectly willing to make the visit.So far as the adverse report of Wiley Government Chemist, mentioned by Bro Young, is concerned, I unhesi-tatingly assert that it is the work of an enemy to theindustry of making sugar from sorghum, and the mostcomplete refutation of the animus of the report, andthe stultification of him who made it will be foundin what Bro Howe will see and the report he makesto you upon it. Wiley reports only his absurd failures and criminal nonsuccesses in the most unblushing man-ner and in the most dishonest intent stops short ofthe splendid success made by his successor at Fort ScottProf. Swenson. What Mr Swenson is doing at

HARDY, Eng[ineer]. & Sup[erintenden]t.Office of the SALT LAKE and FORT DOUGLAS RAILWAY,EAGLE GATE.Salt Lake City, Utah,demonstrated, practically, and by actual production, that the climate and soil of Utah are propitious to the production of crystalizablesugar.By the old crushing mill process, it is true, with the present price of sugar, the business would be but meagrely profitable; but since the introduction and development of the principle of Diffu-sion and its magnificent success as applied to sorghum juices, real-ly doubt^l^ing the out-put, there no longer remains the least doubt, not only on the practicability, but on the profitableness of the enterprize; and I now see, and am throughly convinced, that it is possible for us to save the out-lay of a million dollars a year,and to save it at a profit of 25%.You say, in your letter: "If the manufacture os^f^ sugar can be made a profitable pursuit, there is nothing, that we foresee, in the future circumstances of the people, that would prompt us to counsel you not to undertake this business."This relieves the only dubiety I had in my mind; and I am just as well assured of the practic^a^le results that will follow wellordered efforts, as a miller is assured of obtaining so many poundsof flour from a bushel of wheat, under mill treatment.I have, for the last eight years, made this matter a study, and have not been saitsfied to test alone in the laboratory and in the 
 Topeka and Fort Scott gives the direct lie to Wiley's state-ments and clearly shows the unreliability of the manand his report.I am deeply grieved that the interests of this under-taking should have been retarded even one day by any-thing so dishonest unworthy and unreliable as ChemistWiley's report. On the 2nd March 1887 Hon J. FloydKing in a speech before the House of Representatives upon theSugar manufacture from Sorghun, openly accused MrWiley as follows."I charge—First—that this man Wiley has wantonly andextravagantly spent the money appropriated""second—that he is, in my judgment, in the employ ofFrench & German beetroot sugar manufacturers andsugar machine builders, and London refiners, whose soleobject is to stagnate all efforts of the Government to aid indeveloping our cane sugar industry by the introduction ofthe diffusion process""That he is working in European sugar interests and againstour own his every official and unofficial act since 1882 shows"

HARDY, Eng[ineer]. & Sup[erintenden]t.Office of the SALT LAKE and FORT DOUGLAS RAILWAY,EAGLE GATE.Salt Lake City, Utah,frying-pan, but I have demonstrated by experiments on so large a scale as to practically preclude the possibility of a doubt, whether what is done with the carefulness of the chemist with his phials and his chemicals in his glass tubes and with his spirit lamp, can be accomplished when put practically to the test on a large scale.Now, Brother Woodruff, can you expect anything else from a man who has done this much with these motives, than that he should con-tinue doing, and that he should be willing, knowing as much as I do about this matter, to risk his all,—his future, upon the issue of this venture? In my eyes, it is no longer a venture, but a certainty.There is, it is true, some occasion for alarm in the fact that I am bereft of the tangible support of the Leaders of the people. I cannot even reach them in conversation to explain in details, and to place before them, in the thorough manner that is so desirable, the prospects of success and the means of over-coming difficulties.And the serious question presents itself, whether or not I can find,in the hearts of the Latter day saints, in the absence of the in-spired teachings of their leaders, a sufficient interest for the establishment of the principle of self-se^u^stenance, to induce themto embark their means in a project which must appear to them so vast and difficult of solution. 
 My anxiety for you to be ^correctly^ informed upon thesematters must be my excuse for the length of this communication.Very respectfully submittedYour Brother in the GospelArthur Stayner.P.S. Will you kindly give me an interview ifthis letter needs any further explanationA Stayner

HARDY, Eng[ineer]. & Sup[erintenden]t.Office of the SALT LAKE and FORT DOUGLAS RAILWAY,EAGLE GATE.Salt Lake City, Utah,For a man to be ci^o^nvinced, and then to lack the courage to "sink or swim" upon the rightfulness of his convictions, is to be unworthy of the name of a Latter day saint. For the very basic principle of the existence of this body of God's people, is the courage to bear the responsibility of their convictions: and while I do not lay claim to any especial worthiness, I am thoroughly convinced that the smallest being in God's Church, can reach His ear, and, if hismotives are worthy and divested of absolute selfishness, can lay claim to His assistance: and I trust and believe that even as Peter found the hand of Jesus ready to ^save him, when his lack of faith overcame his power to^ sustain himself^self^ on the sur-face of the water, even so I may find the hand of the same Provi-dence that sees the sparrow fall, ready to help me in the hour ofneed.

 Jany 20th [189]3Prests: Wilford WodruffGeorge. Q. CannonJoseph. F. Smith.Dear Brethren:We are very short of elders: many, whose time has nearlyexpired, wish very much to be home at the Dedication. A number have applied to be released in time to put in their spring crops, or their yearswork is lost. Some must be released in con-sequence of ill health. All this, makes it nec-cessary for me to remain in touch with thisoffice, but I must have a warmer climate than England.The devil has had a greattime in Denmark, near Copenhagen. L. C.Miller, P. C. Gurtsen Jr. and H. C. Hansen, elder[s]from home, and many of the Aarhus branch have received great demonstrations through thevisitation of Angels and God Himself (?) through a Mrs. Jensen, whom this great being called first a poor woman; but after the elders hadstood guard over her for 11 days and nights, [c]asting the devil out of her many times, was 
 2called a pure woman. She gave them con-stant revelation: how many times the must administer to her: the particular part of her body which the enemy got into: and from what I canlearn he invaded every crack and crevice fromhead to heels. The elders found a pleasant nook near the house and dedicated the spot to prayer,and here they received many precious revelations. Mrs.Jensen had them The elders administer to her, that she might ^believe that they believed in her &^ have all [cleave] in her words. Thenclaimed that the phrophets Joseph, Brigham & John were those giving revelation: the accumula-tion kept on until there was 12 of each kin[d]they fought over the poor woman all three days and nights. At the expiration of the allotted time, Mrs.Jensen became a pure woman (!) She was then prepared to give the saints, pure counsel. I laid the matter before the Lord, but did not feel to go there myself, so wrote to Prest. Christiansen to take consewith his brethren, and straighten things out. I said if the Lord had revelations for the people, it wouldcome from the proper source: these spiritual manif[es]-tations were evil, and the adversary would li[ke]to prevent the honest in heart, in that vicinty f[rom] 
 receiving the testimony of the Lord's servants.I send Bro. George E. Young, son of Lorenzo D., home: he has been here aboutthree months: he will tell you his sin, com-mitted with a woman. I leave it to you, as to the wisdom of telling this your aged father George said and said to me, this will hasten fathers deathwhen he knows it. I have no one here butAlfred Solomon, that I can leave in charge of the mission: I have called him to take temporary charge, while I am away, and if you deem himsuitable, write me, and I will hasten home.Albert has the spirit of this work, and he should have the the experience of a travelling elder. Jos. Quinn is in the office now outside of Willy, there is no more to get the Star out. Bro. Solomon could not [illegible]the work. Willy has been ailing, but is now all rig[ht]Such matters as these, makes me feel to keep in w[ork]with the office. You know Bro. Solomon as w[ell]as I do: he is the most experienced we have.shall try him for two or three weeks, until youranswer comes. So far as I know he amply abl[e]to tide over until after dedication, but yous are the best judges. I an sorry the mission is now 
 down: elders are hard to get I know and, perhaps I have not kept you thoroughly posted as to our wants: I have tried to do so, and I haveto be forgiven for any negligence witnessed in m[e]by the Lord, or any brethren. Emigration businessis at a low ebb. The White Star & Cunarder lines:have things all their own way. Second cabin for returning [delay saints] nearly twice first cabin on Guions steamers, which latter have ceasedto run, and may never again [remove] traffic under the same favorable aspect for our emigration. We are at sea about emigration waterI dare not leave the mission until you say Bro.Solomons appointment will be satisfactory, or you [send]some one else to act intergnum. Would that I did feel at liberty to go: I would sail on [page torn] [Teutonic] 25th inst.Many elders are praying to be released, & is my opinion, their prayers should be answered formally: but in consideration of high prices charged on the above named lines of steamers, the expense to the church will be enormous.I think the bret[h]ern who want to go home, & should be released, and insist on going on these, put into under this promise on prices, ought to pay the difference in pric beween Guions good cabin 
 and the present second cabin rates, or waitfor a few weeks until Guions start their steamers. True Guions may go to [page torn]but if the elders wait for their chanceand the Guion Co. fails, they can [3 illegible words]by the church, which will stand good for theirpassage under those circumstances.Please answer this letter soon [page torn]can, that I may feel at liberty tocome home.God bless you [page torn]are the brethren.
