 counsel you as you please dont turn round and oppose them.    I want every man before he enters into a  covenant to know what he is going to do; but we want to know  if this people is going to support the Priesthood. In the name  of Israel's God if you say you will, do so.    We want men appointed to take charge of  the business that did lay on the shoulders of Joseph. Let  me say to you that this Kingdom will spread more than ever  The Twelve have the power now the Seventies the Elders and  all of you can have power to go and build up the Kingdom  in the name of Israel's God.    Nauvoo will not hold all the people who   will come into the Kingdom. We want to build the Temple  so as to get our endowment and if we do our best and Satan  will not let us build it we will go into the wilderness and  we will receive the endowment for we will receive an  endowment anyhow.    Will you abide our counsel? I again  say my soul for any man's if they will abide our counsel  that they will go right into heaven. We have all the signs  and tokens to give to the porter at the door and he will let us  in.    I ask you as quorums do you want Bro  Rigdon to stand forward as your leader your guide your  spokesman. President Rigdon wants me to bring up  the other question first and that is does the Church want and  is it their ownly desire to sustain the Twelve as the First Presidency  of this people?    Here are the Apostles the Bible the Book of  Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants they are written on the  tablet of my heart. If the Church want the Twelve to   stand as the head—the First Presidency of the Church and at  the head of this kingdom in all the world stand next to Joseph

 walk up unto their calling and hold the keys of this kingdom every man  every woman every quorum is now put in order and you are now the  sole controllers of it.    All who are in favour of this in all the congregation of  the Saints manifest it by holding up the right hand. There was   a universal vote. If there are any of the contrary mind—every   man and every woman who does not want the Twelve to preside  lift up your hands in like manner. No hands up. This  supersedes the other question and trying it by quorums.    We feel as though we could take brother  Rigdon in our bosom along with us. We want such men as  brother Rigdon. He has been sent away by brother Joseph to  build up a Kingdom. Let him keep the instructions and  calling; let him raise up a mighty kingdom in Pittsburg  and we will lift up his hands to Almighty God. I think  we may have a printing office and a gathering there. If  the devil still trys to kill us he will have enough to do.    The next is President Marks. Our feeling  is to let him stand as President of the Stake as heretofore  We can build the Temple &c.    You did not know who you had amongst  you. Joseph so loved this people that he gave his life for  them. Hyrum loved his brother and this people unto death  Joseph and Hyrum hasve given their lives for the Church.  But very few knew Joseph's character. He loved you unto   death. You did not know it until after his death. He has  now sealed his testimony with his blood.    If the Twelve had been here we would  not have seen him given up. He should not have been given   up. He was in your midst but you did not know him  He has been taken away for the people are not worthy of  him.    The world is wide. I can preach in England

 Ireland Scotland France Germany &c; I can preach in all the world and  the devils cannot find us. I will sware to you I will not   be given up.    There is much to be done. You have   men among you who sleep with one eye open. The foundation  is laid by our Prophet and we will build thereon. No other  foundation can be laid but that which is laid and we will  have our endowment if the Lord will.    As the authorities do not want us to do  military duty dont do it. If it is necessary my kneck  is ready for the knife. As for myself I am determined  to build up the Kingdom of God and by the bye there will  be a gleaning of grapes and it may be said "to your tents  O Israel."    We can build on the foundation which  was laid by the Prophet. Joseph has finished his work  and all the Devils in hell and all the mobers on earth could  not take his life until he had accomplished his work. God  said I will put a veil over his eyes and lead him up  to the slaughter like a sheep to be killed for the people  are not worthy of him though God loves this people.    Let no man suppose that the Kingdom  is rent from you that it is not organized. If all the quorums of  the Church were slain except the High Priest they would rise up  with the keys of the Kingdom and have the power of the Priesthood  upon them and build up the Kingdom and the devil cannot  help himself.    You can go to a healthy country buy the land  and dont let a cursed scoundrel get in your midst. Let there be  good men good women and whenever a man comes with a wheelbarrow  full of goods dont let him land dont let him a house or buy   of him.    Suppose we had ten thousand such places and

 increasing in greatness perfectly free from these poor devils we should feel  better than we do now. Let us all be humble and get our endowments  all be humble industrious and prudent what sort of a kingdom would it  be? The foundation is laid for more than we can think or talk  about to day.    Is it the will of this congregation that they will  be theth^ tithed^ until the Temple is finished as they have heretofore been?  If so signify it by the uplifted hand—[The vote was unanimous]—    The men will act who never acted before  and they will have the power and authority to do it. Is it the  minds of the congregation to loose the hands of the Twelve and  enable us to go and preach to all the world? We want to know  the feelings of the people. Is it your will to support the Twelve  in all the world in their missions.—[The congregation susttained  this question by a unanimous vote]— Will you leave it to  the Twelve to dictate about the finances of the Church and will  it be the mind of this people that the Twelve teach what will  be the duties of the Bishops in hand ling the affairs of the  Church. Iwant this because Twelve men can do it just as  well as calling this immense congregation together at any other  time —[A unanimous vote]—    We shall have a Patriarch and the  right is in the family of Joseph Smith—his brothers his sons  or some ones of his relations. Here is Uncle John he has  been ordained a Patriarch. Brother Samuel would have  taken the office had he been alive. It would have been  his right. The right is in Uncle John or one of his brothers  —[read Doctrine and Covenants sec III Par 17]— I know that it would  have belonged to Samuel but as it is if you leave it to the  Twelve they will wait until they know who is the man  Will you leave it to the Twelve and they dictate in the  matter —[unanimous vote]— I know it will be let alone for the  present. 
 I feel to bring up brother Rigdon. We are of  one mind with him and he with us. Will this congregation uphold  him in the place he occupies by the prayer of faith and let him  be one with us and we with him --[unanimous]-- The Twelve will   dictate and see to other matters. There will be a committee  for the Temple and now let men stand to their posts and  be faithful".    The Conference adjourned to Oct. the 6th with  the Benediction from Elder Parley P. Pratt.    The next day I attended a council and we  appointed two Trustees in Trust for the Church--namely George Miller  and N. K. Whitney.    Nauvoo at this juncture of our Church  history was seeing gloomy times. The Prophet and Patriarch was  gone from us and there was but little ambition in the people  for a time to do anything though they were very busy working  on the Temple.

Brigham Young President of the Council  Willard Richards Clerk.    Sunday the 18th a vast congregation of the Saints  assembled at the grove to hear a discourse from President Young  upon the excitement then prevailing in Nauvoo in consequence  of some trying to draw away parties after them.    Discourse of President Brigham Young    (Synopsis from my Journal)    I have many things to speak of. It was  my mind in the first place that we should have suitable time  to meditate upon all matters and weigh them even every subject  wherin we felt interested. When the question was asked me if 
 they should continue to baptize for the dead I said I had no counsel to  give upon that subject at present but should think it not best to attend  to it at that time    I have learned some things I did not know  when I came home. I discover a disposition in the sheep to  scatter abroad now the Shepherd is taken away. I do not say  that it will never be right for this people to go from here or scatter  abroad but let them wait until the time comes and until they  get counsel to do so.    The report has gone through the city   that the Twelve have secret understanding with those men  who are going away and taking companies with them that  they shall take all they can and that although the Twelve will  blow it up yet privately they wish it to go on but if it was  the last words I had to say before going into the eternal world  I would sware by the Holy Trinity that it is utterly false and  and not one word of truth in it. There is no man who has any  right to lead away one soul out of this city by the consent of the  Twelve except Lyman Wight and George Miller who have had  the privilege of taking the Pine Company where they pleased  but not another soul has the consent of the Twelve to go  with them.    There is no man who has any liberty  to lead away people into the wilderness from this Church or  to lead them anywhere else by the consent of the Twelve or the  Church except the case above named and I tell you in the  name of Jesus Christ that if Lyman Wight and George Miller  take a course contrary to our counsel and will not act in  concert with us they will be damned and go to distruction  If men will not stop striving to be great and exalted and  lead away parties from us and striving to weaken our  hands they will fall and not rise again and I will destroy  their influence in this Church with the help of God and 
 my brethren. I wish you to distinctly understand that the counsel of  the Twelve is for every family that does not belong to the Pine Company   to stay here in Nauvoo build up the Temple and get their endowment.  Dont scatter. United we stand divided we fall.    It has been whispered about that all who go  into the wilderness with Wight and Miller will get their endowment  but they cannot give an endowment in the wilderness. If we  do not carry out the plan laid down by Joseph and the pattern  he has given for us to work by we cannot get any further  endowment. I want it to sink deep into your hearts that  you may remember it. I repeat it. Let me reason with you  If you stir up the flame of dissent will you get an endowment? No.  You get a party to run here and another there and divide our strength  and weaken our hands and we shall be left and our enemies will flock  around us and destroy us. In that case you will not get your  endowment but will sink and not rise—go to hell and not to the bosom  of Abraham.    Do the people leave here because they are  affraid? Do you fear those who have power to kill the body  If you leave this place for fear of mob before God tell you to go  you will have no place of rest but you will flee from place to  place and go like the Jews until God raises up some other  people to redeem you for if the Devil scares you from this  place he will scare you from all other places.    Let no man go from this place but the  Pine Company brethren but stay here sow plant & build. Put in your  plowshares into the praries. One plowshare will do more to  drive off the mob than two guns. Let us stay here  where the bones of Joseph and Hyrum Samuel Don Carlos  and Father Smith are. Joseph has said if I am slain  in battle or fall in any way I want my body laid in  Nauvoo. I had rather have the dead body of the Prophet  than some men who are alive and I should rather have  the clothes of the Prophet stuffed with straw for President 
 of the United States than any man whose name is now before  the nation for a candidate for he would not do as much harm   We want to build the Temple in this place. If we have to build   it as the Jews built the walls of the Temple in Jerusalem  with a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. How  easily some men are scared. I have never been frightened  yet and I know other men who have not.    Do you suppose the mouth of God   is closed to be opened no more unto us. If this was so I  would not give the ashes of a rie straw for the Salvation  of the Church. If God has ceased to speak by the  Holy Ghost or revelation there is no salvation; but this is not  the case.    There seems to be a disposition manifested  by many to leave Nauvoo and go into the wilderness or  somewhere else. But what if we should go into the  wilderness and we should ask God to give us an  endowment and he should ask us if we were driven   from Nauvoo and who drove us. The Devil  drove us would be the answer. "Well" he might   say "did you not know that I had power over the  devil" Yes; but one said "I would not give a Jack  knife for all Nauvoo and another said I would not  give a pair of mules for the best farm in Hancock County  & I was affraid.    Would the Lord give an endowment to   a people who was frightened away from their duty  These who are wishing to lead away parties contrary to counsel  I would not wish them damned worse than to have a company  after their own likeing for they will soon quaral among  themselves.    If we should go into the wilderness  and ask the Lord to give us an endowment he might ask  us saying "Did I not give you rock in Nauvoo to 
 build the Temple with?"    "Yes."    "Did I not through my Providence furnish men to quary  and cut the stone and prepare it for the building"    "Yes."    "Did I not give you means to build the Temple there?    "Yes."    "Very well, had you died in Nauvoo on the walls  of the Temple or in your fields I would have taken you to   myself and raised up men to officiate for you and you would  have enjoyed the highest glory. Did you make a  sacrifice by tithing?    "No"    "Well I dont wonder you did not believe I had power over the   devil."    Such may go away. But I want to have  the faithful stay here and settle this city. We shall require the  truth of all your property as the tithing for the building of the Temples  for the poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and living by  the Church hereafter so that I can give my whole time to the  business of the Church. I have always supported myself heretofore  in all my travels and labours.    While in England in one year we circulated 60,000  tracts upon our doctrine. This ought to be done in all the world and  it can be where the Elders are faithful to their calling.    Joseph the Testator has been preserved till  now but he has now sealed his testimony with his blood and his testament  should be put in force. While the Testator lived it was all in his own  hands but now he is dead.    There is no remission of sins without the sheding  of blood. You will soon wake up and know things as they are  There has been a great debt paid. There will be no need of more  blood of the Saints being shed at present. By and by you will 
 understand and see that all is right    Wo! Wo! Wo! unto all who have shed the blood of the   Saints and the Lord's Anointed. It must needs be that offences  come but wo unto them by whom they come.    To those who want to go away from this  place I would say wait until the time comes. I will give you  the key. North and South America is Zion and as soon as  the Temple is done and you get your endowment you can go and   build up stakes but dont be in haste. Wait until the Lord  says, Go.    If you have the Spirit of God you can discern  right from wrong. When all is right in the Priesthood and a man  rises up and speaks in the Spirit of God and just right all will  say Amen; but when a man rises up and talks as smooth as   oil if he is not right there will be many queries about it. It will  not edify the body. I give this as a key.    You may go all over North and South America  ^and build up stakes^ when the time comes. The whole continant of America must be  organized into Districts and Presiding Elders appointed over  each district. The time has come when all things must  be set in order. I have had these things upon my mind all  long time. The time has come now for bickering to cease  There must be a strict order of things and we are no longer bound  to harbor blacklegs counterfeiters & bogus makers. We know  all about them. They have been in our midst long enough. I  advise all the Saints to have no dealing with such men. Let  them alone. The time has come that they should be whiped  out of our midst. Let those men alone—let the ungodly  dealers alone. And as to the Doctors who are in our midst  who are our enemies I would say let them alone also for I have  no doubt that three to one who have died in this place had a  doctor.    And I would say wo unto you lawyers 
 for your whole study is to put down truth and put a lie in its stead. I want  the lawyers to know that we have common sense. They want to make  you believe that when you spell baker you mean cider or wiskey  Now let the Doctors and Lawyers alone and leave off bitterness and  evil speaking and you will build the Temple and get an endowment  All you lawyers go away and let us alone and when we get full of the  devil and want you we will send for you. We may then have a  more convenient season.    I want to say to the Saints do not harbour  blacklegs counterfeiters & bogus makers. Wipe them away. It is time  to carry out the design of our Prophet. Do cease to employ doctors  lawyers and merchants who will use your purse and then mob  you. Store your grain in Nauvoo for you will want it  there to eat while you are building the Temple.    I want to say to the hands upon the Temple  be united and to the Committee I would say dont turn away any  person because he is an Englishman Scotchman Irishman or any other  nation but employ every man you can and build the Temple and  your homes.    I would rather pay out every cent to build up  this place and get an endowment even if I was driven the next minute  without anything to take with me.    As to the doctors let them go. I can prove  that a doctor in this place doctored a woman who was in the family way  and he did not know it until she was delivered and both the woman  and child died and if you employ them you will all die; but the  time has come when you neead no longer support them.    There is a distinction between the law of  the land and the law of the Church. You have the privilege of  keeping all shops that does not come in contact with the law of the  the State County or City so I will evade the law says the dealer  and give away wiskey and sell a little tobaco or something else  and charge enough for both but the law of the Church will reach 
 such men if they are members for they will be cut off.    I had a dream which I will here relate.   I saw a fruit tree and I went into the tree to search for fruit. I  soon descovered that some of the main branches on the top growing  from the main body was dead. It seamed necessary to cut  off the dead branches in order to save the tree. So I told  some person to help me cut them off and he steped on to a large  green limb. They were affraid it would break so I put my   shoulder under it and held it up while he cut off the dead  branches. It cracked the green limb but it did not break  After we cut off the dead branches the wounds healed up and  the tree grew finely.    Now let us cut off the dead branches  of the Church that good fruit may grow and the voice will  soon be heard go and build Zion and the great Temple of   the Lord.    A word unto the Seventies. They will  be organized into their different quorums and a presidency of  of seven men will be chosen out of the first Seventy to preside  over each quorum.    Now as you have been warned let   every man warn his neighbour and we will give every man  his appointment as soon as convenient.    May the Lord bless you in the name  of Jesus Christ Amen.    In the afternoon the assembly was again  addressed in a simlar strain by Heber C. Kimball and  President Young but I was at home writing and hence  did not take notes; and in the evening in company with  Mrs Woodruff I rode out to bro John Benbows and spent the  night. We came to the conclusion to leave our only son  Wilford with brother and Sister Benbow while I took 
 my mission to England accompanied by my wife    Returning the next day I met in Council with the Twelve  We conversed concerning the route we should take and it was thought that  the northern route would be the healthiest. Among other things some  dreams were rehearsed. The following was told by myself:    "I met with Joseph Smith in the congregation  of the Saints. He had his old Hebrew and German Bible and preached  to the Saints but he seamed to be too thronged by the people and he  rose up lifted up a curtain and passed into another room where the  people could not disturb him and there he was going to teach  the people.    The following is from the hand of Brigham  Young:    Certificate [Figure]    "I hereby certify that Elder Wilford Woodruff has received  a mission by order of the quorum of the Twelve to England to  preside over the Churches in that land and I feel to bless him  in the name of the Lord with all belonging to or dwelling  beneath his roof at this time consisting of his wife and  children and sister Mary who is assisting them  to get on their journey.    Brigham Young    On the 23rd I visited Emma Smith the  widow of the Prophet. She let me have a piece of oak  for a staff out of the coffin of the martyred Joseph. She  also let me have a pair of white cotton gloves and  Mrs. Woodruff a  pocket ^cotton^ handkerchief both of which were woren ^worn^ by the Prophet while  living    We called upon Sister Mary Smith widow  of Hyrum the Patriarch and she gave us some hair from 
 the heads of Joseph, Hyrum Samuel and Don Carlos Smith all  brothers and the same parents. I also obtained some hair of the  quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints. My intention in obtaining the hair was that  I might put a portion of each in the knob of my staff as a relick  of those noble men—the master Spirits of the nineteenth century.    I next visited Mother Lucy Smith the  parent of Joseph—the Lord's Anointed—and of Hyrum Samuel  and Don Carlos, and the wife of Joseph the First Patriarch of  the last dispensation all of whom directly or indirectly fell martyrs  for the cause of God. The old Mother and Prophetess felt  most heart broken at the loss of her children and from the wicked  and cruel treatment she had received from the hands of the  world. She beged a blessing at my hand. I laid my  hands upon her head and by the Spirit of God proclaimed  the following    Blessing  of  Mother Lucy Smith  under the hands of Wilford Woodruff  on the 23 of August 1844    Beloved Mother in Israel    According to your request I lay  my hands upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth  and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the keys of the kingdom  of God to bestow a blessing upon you for though art worthy of  all blessings    As I laid my hands upon thy husband  Joseph the Senior, the Patriarch of the Church by his request  to bless him as he lay upon his bed like Jacob of old ready  to gather up his feet and sleep with his fathers and I about 
 to take my departure for foreign nations over the sea which was the last time I  we met on earth in like manner do I esteam it a blessing and privellge to  lay my hands upon your head in your decline of life to leave with you  my parting blessing.    I am again called to bid farewell to my native  land and visit foreign climes to bear record of the words of God. We may  never meet again on earth * but I thank my God that I have this  privilege of blessing thee for thou art the Greatest Mother in  Israel. The sons which thou hast borne and cherished are the  most noble spirits that ever graced humanity or tabernacled in the  flesh. Their work shall be had in honourable remembrance  throughout all generations. Though counted among transgressors  they like the Messiah have shed their blood for the sins of  the people and freely offered their lives and sealed their testimony  ^with their blood.^    Thou hast lived to see the fall of thy   sons by the rage of Gentile hands but like an eternal rock in  the midst of the ocean thou has stood and God has given thee  the desire of thy heart in seeing the Keys of his Kingdom  held in the hands of thy posterity so planted on the earth  that they shall never be taken from it until He reigns whose  right it is to reign.    Let thy heart be comforted in the midst  of thy sorrow for thou shalt be had in honourable remembrance  forever in the congregations of the righteous. Thou shalt be  remembered in thy wants during the remainder of thy days and  when thou art called to depart thou canst lie down in peace  having seen the salvation of God in laying an everlasting  foundation for the deliverance of Israel through the instrumentality  of thy sons.    I seal upon your head all the blessings   of the fulness of the gospel of the "First Born" and all  those blessings which have been sealed upon your head  heretofore. If we meet no more on earth we shall meet    *We never did. Though Moth Smith lived 15 years after that 
 in the morn of the first resurrection when you shall receive thrones  and Powers and dominion and Dingdom with thy husband in his  exaltation in the lineage of his fathers.    I seal these blessings upon your head  in the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy  Priesthood: Amen.    Set Apart For My Mission  (Nauvoo August 24 1844)    The following blessing was confered upon my head and  I was set apart by the Twelve for my mission to England to take  charge of all the Churches in Europe Elder John Taylor was   mouthpiece for the quorum.    Brother Woodruff, We lay our hands  upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ and by the  authority of the Holy Priesthood to seal upon your head a  blessing and set you apart unto the important mission which  is appointed unto you of the Lord by the voice of the Twelve  to go over the Sea to England to take charge of the churches  throughout that land; and we ask God the Eternal Father  in the name of Jesus Christ to bless you with health  and strength open^open^ the door before you and your family  that you may have food and rament and money and all things  necessary to make you comfortable and that the power of God may  rest upon you in a greater degree than in any mission  before. We seal upon your head these blessings. You shalt  be preserved to finish your mission and return home with your  family and meet in the Temple of the Lord and rejoice therein  and shout Hosanna. You shall have power and wisdom to  accomplish the design of your missions and shall have the desire  ^of your heart^ given you in all things in righteousness before God." 
 The next day was Sunday and I was called upon to  address the congregation of Saints assembled in Nauvoo as I was about to leave  for my mission to England. The following is a few of the items I presented  to the people in my discourse.    "There is a Spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty  giveth it understanding. It is through this principle that this congregation is  assembled together at this place. You had understanding of the things of God  ^by^and His Spirit..  ^by the Spirit of God.^    I have now one important declaration to make to you  and that is that inasmuch as you will be united in heart and mind and  in action in suppoting your counsellors—the Priesthood of God—the  authorities of the Church and follow the counsel given you as you  have endeavoured to follow the counsel of the Prophet while he was living   you will be safe and blessed and will prosper but if you are divided and  reject the counsel of God you will fall. Union and faithfulness is your  salvation. It is true you have been led by one of the best men that  ever graced humanity or tabernacled in the flesh but he is gone; he  has sealed [h]is testimony with his blood. He loved this people unto death.    I would now call upon this people to be  united in building up on the foundation which the Prophet Joseph has  laid You have been called to suffer much in the cause in which  you are engaged but if judgement begins at the house of God Babylon will  not escape and if there is a fire in a green tree a dry tree will not  escape. There is no people ^more^ prepared for the shock that is coming  on the earth than ^the^ Latter-day Saints. The object we have is to  secure blessings beyond the veil in the first resurrection. This  is what we are preparing for.    Again I would say let not the Saints be  troubled because they have lost their Prophet. I would ask because  the Prophet has sealed his testimony with his blood does that destroy  the Gospel or take away the Power of God. Is truth annihalated  or has the Priesthood found a burying place? I tell you nay  His testimony is now in force. Therefore my counsel is to 
 follow the example of those who have gone before and be faithful unto  death. If you will be united and go to with your whole mights  in building that Temple you have power to accomplish it and  get an endowment"    I earnestly exhorted them to faithfulness and  requested their prayers in my  behalf and asked forgiveness of any  thing which I might have done wrong and bid the congregation  farewell.    Joseph Gave the Keys of the Kingdom to the Twelve    I was followed by President Brigham Young  Also Elders P. P. Pratt and Orson Hyde spoke and testified that  Joseph the Prophet had ordained anointed and appointed the Twelve  to lead the Church and had given them the keys of the kingdom for  that purpose. W. W. Phelps and R Cahoon bore testimony  that Joseph said upnto the Twelve "Upon your shoulders the  kingdom of God must rest in all the world. Now round up  your shoulders and bear it."    Many important things were spoken by the  brethren at this time which I had not the leasure to write.    Next day I went to the river with Mrs  Woodruff to be baptized for some of our ^dead^ friends. I was administered  to under the hands of Elder G. A. Smith as proxy for five of my  family. I also baptized my wife for five of her friends. Willard  Richards confirmed us.    On the Temple at Midnight    After preparing for my departure bidding farewell  to the Saints and blessing many until midnight of the 27th  in company with Brother and Sister Smoot and Hannah  Ells my wife and I walked to the Temple of the Lord in  Nauvoo. As we approached we lifted up our eyes to  view the sacred scene which the silver moon illuminated  with the brightness of her glory After gazing a few 
 moments upon her walls and her capitols which were standing upon the ground  completed we all as of one accord ascended the ladders on to the top of the walls:  Several of the police and friends followed our example among whom was General  CC Richard  and Elder Godard.    We repared to the South west corner of the Temple and there  we bowed our knees upon the top corner stone which was prepared to receive its  capitol and theirre with uplifted hands towards heaven I called upon the God  of Abraham Isaac and Jacob; offering the gratitude of our hearts for preserving  our lives and giving us power to so far build the Temple; praying that it  might be finished and the Saints receive their endowments to plant the work of  God in all the earth; asking the Father for a just reckoning for the shedding  of the blood of the Lord's Anointed; praying Him to enable us to fulfil our mission  and return to the bosom of the Church; invoking a double portion of the Spirit of  Joseph to rest upon Brigham and the Twelve to bear off the Kingdom in all the   world and for the power of the Priesthood to rest upon all the quorums and Elders  of Israel and dedicating myself family and all belonging to me in the name  of Jesus Christ unto the Lord God.    After prayers we descended and returned to our homes  with joy and peace in our hearts.    Letter of Appointment    Nauvoo August 26th 1844  To All Elders and Saints in Europe Greeting:    We send our beloved brother Wilford Woodruff  to England to take charge of all business transactions pertaining to the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both spiritual and temporal  We wish you to give dilligent heed to his counsel in all things and as we  have not the opportunity of informing you of what has transpired this  season, by letter, our beloved brother will make known unto you all things.    We wish the brethren to be faithful and dilligent  in keeping all the commandments of God and in hearkening to the counsels  of those who are sent to counsel them. Let no man or set of men think 
 they have power or authority or the keys of the kingdom above the Apostle  Wilford Woodruff whom we send unto you to instruct you in the things  pertaining to life and salvation.    Though our Prophet be slain for the word of God  and the testimony of Jesus yet the keys of the Kingdom remain in the  Church and the heavens are not closed neither is the mouth of the Almighty  sealed up that he cannot speak. The God of Israel will communicate to  his disciples all things necessary for the building up of his Kingdom upon  the earth until Israel is gathered: yea even all the blood of Abraham scattered  over all the earth Zion established Jerusalem rebuilt and the whole earth  be filled with the glory and knowledge of God.    We wish all the Saints in England to  continue their gathering as usual to the land of America and they  may have the privilege of appointing a Committee to visit the land   of America to prepare a location for a settlement of the brethren from  Europe according to their desire under the direction and counsel of Elder  Wilford Woodruff.    And further we would say unto the Saints  in all the world that may be visited by Elder Wilford Woodruff that  inasmuch as they will hearken unto his counsel they shall be blessed;  inasmuch as they shall render him any assistance in his mission  they will be doing the will of God and shall not lose their reward. And  we desire that all Saints may use their efforts to sustain him in this  important mission which he is called to fulfil by their faith prayers  and brotherly love according to the grace of God for he is quallified to  teach in all things pertaining to the Church and Kingdom of God  established in these last days.    Therefore dear brethren we would say unto you  in conclusion be humble and faithful and hearken dilligently unto the counsel  of this our beloved brother in the Lord Elder Wilford Woodruff and  the blessing of God will attend you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.    Brigham Young President of the Twelve  Willard Richards Clerk 
 Leaves Nauvoo for England    On the 28th I parted with the quorum of the Twelve ^at the Temple^ and started on  my mission Our company consisted of myself wife and two children Hiram  Clark and wife and Cap. Dan Jones and wife and three brethren who came  with their teams to convey us to Chicago where we arrived on the 7th of  the next month, September; and on the next day we went on board the propell [page torn]  Oswego to journey up the lakes on our way east.    We arrived with a fair breeze at the Manatow  Islands at 12 o clock at noon and spent three hours there. With Mrs Woodruff  I walked over the same beach that we walked over together after being wrecked  on the Chesapeak in Sep 1841. It brought the scene fresh to our minds  We wrote on some smooth stones concerning our wreck and our mission  to England, our names dates &c; and at three o clock we left the Island  and continued our journey.    Cry of Fire At Midnight    After leaving Detroit on the morning of the 17th  we sailed well through the day and evening until midnight when a  strong wind arose the lake became rough and the boat rocked badly  and in the midst of it when we we were opposite the Cleveland lighthouse  a cry of Fire Fire Fire rang through the boat by the watch on deck  We immediately leaped from our births in our night clothes and each  one caught a bucket as best he could and I caught a bucket about half  full of water and ran barefoot as I was to the stern of the boat looking  for the fire while some was running up stairs. I leaped into the engine  room and saw the fire in one corner of the stern of the boat. I ran over the  pile of coal and dashed my water into the fire which was not larger than  a half bushel measure at the same time a bucket of water flung by Capt  Davis struck the fire and it was extinguished.    There is nothing more terrible and alarming than the  cry of fire at sea or on any water out of the reach of land. It is far more 
 terrible than a storm or wreck for when fire gets the control all hope is lost  and persons will plunge into the raging deep to escape its fury. On my  return to the cabin I found one woman in convulsions with alarm and Mrs  Woodruff holding her and she did not get over it until the next day.    On the 19th under a fair wind we crossed  Lake Erie entered the mouth of Welland Canal to go round the Falls into   Lake Ontario on the Canadian side. The Canal was 28 miles  long and had 38 locks.    On the 23rd in the Lake Ontario a gale  arose at midnight and during the next day we had a very rough  time and fire again broke out in the midst of it.    Journying on by boat and rail I arrived  at my father's house at Farmington on the 30th. My wife and  children left me on the road several days before to visit her parents  and family.    I had quite an interesting time in visiting  my family and friends in Farmington and neighbouring places  and during my stay there I ordained my uncle Ozem Woodruff  unto the office of High Priest.    My native place & family I left again on the 5th of October and  arrived in Boston two days later. Here I found the eastern churches  were passing through a critical state and I wrote to President Young  giving him an account thereof. Elder G J. Adams at this time was   holding discussion with O Bachellon at the Malrlbury Chapel. It  was a money getting scheme.    On the 12th I declaired in great power  and plainness to the Church in Boston against iniquity in all its forms  informing the Saints that any man from the head to the foot would  be brought to justice if he broke the commandments of God and advised  all to be cautious and for none to throw themselves to ruin because  others do wrong.    I had a convers[at]ion with Bro Whitmore  and he related to me the following dream 
 He had prayed to God to let him see Joseph in a dream and he  fell asleep and dreamt that he saw the heavens opened and beheld some of  the things of eternity. He saw a personage rise out of the earth and  an Elder informed him that it was Joseph Smith. Joseph did not speak  to him but droped some slips of paper on the ground from whence  he arose. Brother Whitmore picked up one of them and read upon  it the words— "Emma is not worthy of me." He wished  to read the others but the person with him picked them up and put   them in his pocket and did not let him read them.    After my meeting that evening Elder Adams  and Brannan prefered a charge against Elder Hardy for slander  and the case was to be tried on the following Tuesday.    On the Sunday I met a large congregation  Sister Vose that day gave me 11 dollars and another sister five to  help me on my mission and in the afternoon's meeting a collection  was taken up for the same object making in all about 50 dollars  with the $15 given me at Sister Vose's. At night I attended another  discussion between Adams & Bachellon.    I visited Lowel where there I found Elder  William Smith; and the Branch at that place was in a sad  condition of disatisfaction and in Boston on that evening the trial  was to come off against Elder John Hardy to try to cut him off for  slandering Adams Brannan and William Smith.    I was at Gilsum N. H.  on the 21st where I  arrived with two brethren having rode from Peterboro to Elder Chilon  Mack's son of Solomon Mack. Here I preached in the evening  and spent the night with Solomon Mack aged 72 brother of Lucy  Smith mother of the Prophet Joseph. I spent the evening in  conversation about the Smith's family.    The next day was the last one set by the Millerites  for the Comming of Christ. I rode to the old home stead of Mother  Smith where she was born on the side of a hill and the Brook Ashuilet [Ashuelot River]  It was truly a rural place. We rode through Walpole had a good 
 view of Westminster in Vermont called upon several brethren and in  company with Elders Charles A Adams and Alfred Cordon preached in  the evening at the schoolhouse at Drewsville.    Next day I was a[t] Peterborough and thence on  the following to Boston where at the Post Office I found a letter from   my wife stating that both her and the children were very sick.    I directly started on the next day to my wife  and arrived at Scarborough on the same day and found my wife & children  Here for the next month I was as it were blockaded with sickness  and surrounded with darkness and it seaemed as if the dDestroyer was  was trying to hedge up my way to hinder me on my mission for  not only my wife and children but a number of her family was afflicted  nigh unto death.    We left our little daughter Phebe Amelia  with my wife's father and mother and on the 21st of November  I started with my wife and youngest child Susan Cornelia for New  York to set sail for England.    A Peculiar Dream [FIGURE]    While at my father-in-laws I dreamt a peculiar  dream. Much of it was unutterable and cannot be written. Indeed  I cannot comprehend it myself. Among other things I thought  I was called to hold with the Twelve the Keys of the Kingdom in all  the world and I travelled with them over much of the earth  and finally travelled through many countries alone and when  I got through I saw many things which I cannot write and  in the end Joseph Smith the Prophet assissted me to come into  the place where he was and pointed out my work and portion  ^and^ of labour. I immediately entered into the duties  assigned me.    I also had on the same night another  dream. I was in the presence of the Prophet Joseph 
 and was conversing with him about his death. I told him I felt bad about  it and that had I known he would have been taken away so soon I should  have conversed more with him while living and asked him more questions  He said it was not his fault I did not. Speaking of my work and duties  he said I had better get a dozen to help me.    I    I stoped at Boston on my way and met with the  Church and cut off eight from the Church who had joined Sydney Rigdon's  faction. This left the Boston Church firm.    On the Sunday Nov 24th after leaving Boston  I was with the Saints in New Bedford with whom I held meetings  that day during which three were baptized.    The Monday I spent taking a view of the  city which for beauty and elegance and location is hardly to be  surpassed. It is a ^the most^ noted city for fitting out of walemen.  The whole city has been built up through the wale trade. The  docks were lined with casks of wale and sperm oil. We went  aboard of a number of wale ships which were fitting out which  would carry from fifteen hundred to three thousand barrels of  oil. A sister gave me three pair of specimen of shels brought  from the wale country.    I arrived in New York on the  29 where I received a letter from my father and mother in law  stating that Samuel Deming had turned him off from the  mill which he had rented and occupied all his lifetime to old  age and after he had spent the last summer in repairing the mills  and when they were ready to start and the Winter coming  on he turned him off without notice.    At New York I also received a letter  from President Young in answer to the one I wrote him from  Chicago and several days after its receipt I wrote a long  letter to President Young ^him^ informing him of the recklessness of  William Smith and George J. Adams during that season. 
 I was at the time on a visit to Philadelphia spending  a few days with Jedediah M. Grant and the Saints there. I returned  to New York on the fourth of December being accompanied 40  miles on the way by Elder J. M. Grant.    The 5th was my last day on shore which  I spent with my wife's brother Ilus F. Carter packing up my trunks  and preparing to leave.    We were on board the splendid new  packet ship John R. Skiddy Capt Wm Skiddy with sails  hoisted going out of Sandy Hook about 11 o'clock Dec the 8th  when the pilot left us and we steared on our course.    The company of the brethren and families  consisted of myself wife and child Elder Dan Jones and wife  and Elders Milton Holmes and Leonard Hardy on  mission to England to build up and sustain the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in that land.    We had a heavy gale on the 11th and  we were driving under head winds and bare poles during the  day and in the evening about 9 o'clock the gale increased and  it seemed as though the yards would be torn from the mast  We kneeled before the Lord and prayed unitedly that he would  cause the gale to cease and the wind to change that we might  go forward and not backward. In a little time the wind  suddenly ceased and finally changed to the South-west which  gave us fair wind.    Christmas day on the ocean which  was the first one I ever spent at Sea. We had preserve pudding  for dinner and short cake. We enjoyed ourselves had a light  breeze and one sail in sight.    We entered the Irish Channel on the   28th and here we were beating about under foul winds  for some days. 
 [FIGURE]    A Dream  on the Night of the 30th Dec 1844    I dreamt that I was in Council with the martyred Prophet  and Patriarch and also with the quorum of the Twelve Apostles in  America. I thought we had all to be ordained for some purpose  I was called upon by President Young and another person to assist  in administering the ordinances. In the midst of the Council Sidney  Rigdon came in and was objected to by Hyrum Smith. I  awoke and again fell asleep and dreamt of being in Council  with the Twelve and others. I made an address to them  John E. Page arose to address the meeting but was stoped  by some female and was followed by Elder Willard Snow.    I have recorded this dream at the time in  my daily Journal yet I did not pay much attention to dreams  on shipboard.    The close of the year found us bearting  about as we had been for several days in the Irish Channel.    Synopsis  of the travels and labours of Wilford Woodruff in 1844    I travelled in the United States in many of the principal  places and minor towns and cities in all visiting between 50  and a hundred journeyed through some part of Canada and crossed  the Atlantic making in all a distance of ten thousand and  fifty miles.    I held fifty three meetings and attended  ten Conferences. 
 Councils with the First Presidency & Twelve    I met with the quorum of the Twelve in twelve Councils  and with Joseph Hyrum the quorum of Apostles and   other brethren in transacting the affairs of the Kingdom in   thirteen Councils.    In The Endowments    I attended with Joseph Hyrum and the Twelve  in receiving our endowments twenty one meetings.    Baptized for the Dead    I was proxy in the ordinance of baptism for the  dead for nineteen persons.    Baptized Confirmed & Ordained    I baptized for the remission of sins 6 persons and  confirmed 42 and I ordained 1 Patriarch 3 High Priests  25 Elders 9 Priests 3 Teachers and 2 Deacons.    Married Blessed &c    I married two couple blessed six children and administered  to 24 sick persons.    Sermons Reported etc.    I reported 11 sermons of the Prophet Joseph and 17 of the Twelve  and others all of which I recorded in my Journal and wrote 65 letters  and received 17 and obtained a number of subscribers to our papers. 
 The New Year at Sea    The New Year found me and my family and companions  Dan Jones and wife and Elders Hiram Clark Milton Holmes  and Leonard Hardy still on the Packet ship John R Skiddy  beating about in the Irish Channel against head wind as we  had been for five days making but little progress.    On the 3rd of Jan. we landed in   Liverpool glad to put our feet again on the land after being 27  days at Sea. On landing we took a cab and drove to 36  Chapel Street to find Elder Hedlock but no one being in we  spent the night at the Pig & Whistle but the next day I had an  interview with Elders Hedlock and Ward and spent a little time  in talking over affairs.    The5th was Sunday and we held meetings  in the Music Hall at which myself and companions Elders  Dan Jones, Clark Hardy and Holmes addressed the Saints. 
 Farmington June 25 1845    Dear Son & Daughter Wilford & Phebe Woodruff    Days weeks & months have elapsed since your Parents commen-  enced looking for a communication from their Children the other side the   atlantic, but they looked in vain, they however had the satisfaction at length   (th o, a mysterious one,) of hearing secondhanded by the way of sister Betsy that   they were in the land of the living & in the enjoyment of health which we   were truly glad to learn, yet we were much pugzzled in our minds as to what   it could all mean for we knew that Son Wilford had ever paid special  attention to addressing his Parents by way of writing & particularly so   when at England, but we could not understand why a Letter should not   come as direct here as to simsbury & yet we could not feel that he would now   pay less attention to his Parents than formerly under their present peculiar  cirscumstances, but, we had finally concluded to write you without waiting   longer to hear from you—when about three days since your father brought   in a Letter saying, he believed it was from Webster, I took it very anxiously & said,   are you sure it is from Nauvoo—he thought so. I commenced reading it & had   poerused some lines before I found that it was actually from England this   was under date of April 18th we were rejoiced to learn as we did there from that   you were enjoying good health through the mercy & favor of God & also that   you had the heartfelt joy of learning that your little one you left behind   is also alive & well together with other friends, your Letter was all interesting   but yet w[e] [c]ould not feel that this was the first, written by you to us since   your arrival at England your father said he was sure this must the second   & I thought truly the exspression that you had not heard a word from us   denoted that you had previously written, as the understanding between us was   that I should write after hearing from you—But I will Inform you somewhat   of our situation the winter past, we have both enjoyed comfortable health for the   most part, your father has laboured in the old Saw Mill thro the winter when   he has not at Wards, or the Doctors old Mill, he ^has^ taken charge of both which has

 Salt Lake, February the 26th 1894.    Dear sir!    Excuse me if I allow me to take the   liberty to take up with the present  a few minuts of your valuable time.  I am in distress, both of my arms   have been paralyzed in consequence of   lead poisoning, am unable to do any hard   work, have not been capable to obtain   any suitable employment, which would   enable me to make a living, in spite   of my most ernest efforts, and I am   forced to ask for help. Therefore I allow   me to recommend myself to your   kind consideration for assistance.    Respectfully    Frank Kruger 
 furnished him with employ thro the winter & spring to the present time except   a small period in winter & then we both felt that it was quite as profitable for   him, or would be to recruit a while as to continue laboring — we have enjoyed  ourselves as well since we have been at this place as perhaps at any period of our   lives, we have a convenient & pleasant house — especially now as it is coming   warm weather. I could not have supposed it possible, that I could have made  it home so readily as I did, concidering my attachment to an established  home, but I will faurther say, that we have lived as comfortable & as a well as   we ever did, tho your father as not purchased as much fresh meat  thro the winter as formerly, but he has not cared as much about it, he   has paid his rent monthly & in this has gone beyond the young Men who   have lived in the house with us & he has not as yet I believe taken up all his   earnings has not considered ^it^ so at any rate, We recd a Letter from Azmon   some two or three months since stating that they were all in comfortable health   that he intended to have written us before at the time Thompson returned   last fall his object was to invite his Father to come & live with them or by —   & this he did in a very handsome & feeling manner he thought he could   provide work a plenty for him if he wished it, that he was about setting up   a shingle Mill, &c that tho he did not wish to influence either of us or urge  us to come contrary to our minds yet that after all it was his opinion   that it would be better for us to go there as ^truly^ should we even want to go to   Nauvoo to live with our children there, we should only be so far on our way  We have not yet written him in reply, but must before long he said that   when we had made up our minds on the subject, wished us to write  our minds I expect were not long wanting in this respect at least   mine was not, your father said at the time, he did not know but we had   better go there as he she should not probably be able to live here a great while   being so dependant on others for such work as he would be able to do, but I  told him, I expected providence would provide a way for us to be with our   children & the saints at Nauvoo — but, that I thought we might as well  give up our principles at once as to think of going to Richland to live   however kindly disposed Azmon might be towards us — I have just  got Azmonds Letter to see what he wanted us to say to you, he writes thus,  "I was very sorry I could not meet Br Wilford at your house last Nov, but   I could not. I guess he thinks strange that I did not do so much as write   I did write, but was so long about it, that I did not send it. If you write to Br Wilford 
 We boarded several days at Mr Powells No 11 Key Street  From first to last during a quarter of a century and reaching to 20  years later than my present date the Elders boarded with this  Wm Powell and afterward his widow.    Elder Clark and myself then rented a two  rooms at Mr. Bagnalls No 38 Highfield St where we  remained several weeks and then rented a house in Nor    In the meantime we had received an interesting  letter from Elder John Taylor and another from President Young  bearing good news of the unity of the Church in America and   that Parley P. Pratt had gone to New York to take charge of  affairs in the eastern churches and publish a paper.    We also on the 16th of the mo[n]ths started  a ^company^ ship load of 100 Saints on the Palmyra for New Orleans  under the Presidency of Elder Amos Fielding and Elders Carnes   and W. Benson his Counsellors.    On Sunday the 19th in the morning  I preached in the Music Hall Liverpool and in the afternoon  as I entered the meeting Elder Ward spoke to me and wished  me to go with him to Manchester and attend evening meeting  as there had been an appointment for an American Elder  to preach. Accordingly we took the rail and arrived  just as the meeting commenced. Elder Ward introduced  me and I addressed the meeting 1 hour and twenty minutes.    Here I again met Elders Leonard Hardy  Milton Holmes and Charles Miller with whom I pleasantly  spent the Monday and returned on the following day to Liverpool.    In the 9th No of the Millennial Star  vol [blank] there is a long address of mine written to the Saints in the British Islands.    About the middle of February I received  letters from Elder John Taylor from Nauvoo and from   P P Pratt who was presiding over the eastern Churches in

Special Conference  held in  Manchester Sunday Feb 16, 1845.    There were present Wilford Woodruff President of the Mission  his Counsellors Elders Hedlock and Ward with five High Priests  30 Elders 31 Priests 21 Teachers and 4 Deacons.    We met with the officers before the public  meeting and laid before them the buisness of the day and then  a vast assembly of the Saints gathered in Conference capacity  and we laid before them the changes designed for the Manchester  Conference and it was proposed that Elder Milton Holmes preside  over the Conference and Elder J. D. Ross over the Manchester  branch both of whom accepted their appointment. Sacrament  was then administered which occupied the time till dark.    In the evening we had another mamoth  meeting. Elder Hedlock first addressed the assembly and  then he and Elder Ward had to leave for ^Liverpool^   but could scarcely get out of the crowded Hall. I then arose and   addressed the congregation and the Spirit of the Lord was with  us and love and union pervaded the congregation.    It was a scene to make the heart   glad to behold together in a foreign mission so many Saints.

Wilfred Woodruff,  President of the Church of   Jesus Christ of the Latter-  Day Saints.    Dear Sir:    Regretting my inability to   see you when I called yester-  day, I take the liberty of   addressing you this note   which will explain the pur-  pose of my visit. The San   Francisco Examiner, which   I have the honor to repre-  sent, will publish about   February 1st next, a special-  edition to be known as the   Midwinter Fair edition, which   will be devoted to the in-  terests of the Western states  and territories.

 THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER.    To the Latter-day Saints in Zion and   throughout the world:    Beloved Brethren and Sisters—A  little over two years ago we were im-  pressed to call upon the Latter-day   Saints to set apart a day for fasting  and solemn prayer unto the Lord.  Our position at that time was such   that it seemed as though no earthly  power could deliver us from the evil  which environed us and which threat-  ened our overthrow. Turn which  way we would, every avenue seemed  closed against us. Human help was be-  yond our reach. Our eyes and hearts  under those circumstances, turned to   the Lord as the only power to which  we could appeal for succor. Do we  say too much when we testify that the  Lord did on that occasion condescend   to hear and answer the supplication  of His people.    Their humiliation before Him was  not without its fruits. If the objects  which were suggested in our circular  letter at that time to be prayed for be  examined, the results will show how  wonderfully the Lord has granted the   prayers of His people?    In view of this, and the great mercy  shown unto us by our Father in   heaven in permitting us, at our recent  General Conference, to lay the top  stone of the Salt Lake Temple with  shouts of Hosanna to God and the   Lamb, it has suggested itself to us that   it would be most appropriate for the  Latter-day Saints to gather in their  various places of worship, on Sunday  the first day of May, 1892, and in fast-  ing and prayer, offer up to the Most  High their heartfelt and solemn  thanksgivings for His goodness and  mercy, which He has shown unto them  and the deliverance that He has  wrought out in their behalf.    Surely, no people have greater cause  for thanksgiving and praise than have   the Latter-day Saints throughout these  mountains. And as we cannot have   occasion for thanksgiving because of   deliverance wrought our for us, with-  out our brethren and sisters in other  lands sharing in our joy, it is proper  that they, too, should select a day, as  may be suitable and convenient to  them, in like manner to fast and pray  and offer up their gratitude and thanks  to the Great Creator for the blessings  He has bestowed upon His people.    We have decided to select Sunday  for this purpose, because it can meet  with a more general observance on  the part of all the people than would be   possible upon any other day.    Every man, woman and child be-  longing to our Church should join  in this glad service, for, although  we have many obstaclcs to con-  tend with, and the adversary of our  souls has not made truce, nor laid  down his arms, yet the Lord has  spoiled many nf his schemes, and des-  troyed his snares, and has provided for  us a way of escape from his power.    In our prayers we should still sup-  plicate the Almighty Father to con-  tinue to bless and deliver His Zion, and  to prepare the way for the ushering in  of the full reign of righteousness and  truth, when He whose right it is to  reign shall hold undisputed sway over  all the earth.    The following resolution was unani-  mously adopted by the immense as-  semblage of people at the laying of the   top-stone of the Temple:    Believing that the instruction of   President Woodruff, respecting the  early completion of the Salt Lake  Temple, is the word of the Lord to us,  I propose that this assemblage pledge  themselves, collectively and individu-  ally, to furnish, as fast as it may be  needed, all the money that may be re-  quired to complete the Temple at the   earliest time possible, so that the dedi-  cation may take place on April 6th,  1893.    Plans have been suggested for the  collection of the funds needed to com  plete the Temple in accordance with  this resolution: but we have decided  that no better occasion could offer for  this purpose than the time when the  Saints shall be assembled to ob-  serve this day of prayer and thanks-  giving. Subscriptions can then be  taken by the various Bishops and other  presiding officers from all who are  present at the meetings; and if all are  not prepared to give that which they   desire to subscribe at the time, they  can make their arrangements to pay  by installments.    It is very desirable that this labor  should be completed so that the  sacred building can be dedicated to the  Lord at the General Conference, April  6th, 1893. Steps have already been  taken to have the work done, with the  full expectation that the funds which  were voted for when this reso-  lution was adopted will be forthcoming  in time to meet all the payments. We   feel assured there will be no disap-  pointment in this, if the Bishops and  other presiding authorities do their   duty.    There is no labor in which the Lat-  ter-day Saints feel more deeply inter-  ested than in the building and com-  pleting of Temples.    This Temple at Salt Lake City has  long been in process of erection. By the  6th of April next, forty years will have  elapsed since the laying of the founda-  tion stones. It seems proper, then, that  the expiration of that period should wit-  ness its dedication. We trust that no  exertions will be spared to accomplish  this end, and that all will respond lib-  erally to the call which will be made  upon them.    Praying the Lord to bestow upon all  the Latter-day Saints upon this occa-  sion the spirit of prayer and thanks-  giving, we remain,    Your Brethren,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEO. Q. CANNON,  JOSEPH F. SMITH,    First Presidency of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

I hope Son Webster is beginning to see better days in regard to   making his family comfortable, as Eunice writes (in answer to my inquiries after giving some   account of the hardships they had been called to encounter) "now Mother" if there is a bright   side to the picture, we will have it, she then speaks of Dwights joining the Coach & carriage   association & of the prospect there was of its promoting their comfort & prosperity, she also stated  that they had recieved a number of Dollars from you, & at a time when they were about run ashore   which made the favor peculiarly acceptable, I believe E has held up with good courage & felt a good   degree of patience through the varying scenes she has been called to pass through since she left   a fathers house & home, Sister C & Betsey are now with us & B. will give you some informa-  tion by the way.

 united together in the Everlasting Covenant. I had often thought how  much I should like to see the Prophet Joseph meet with a   Conference of Saints in England but it was not granted  to the British nation to have the Prophet in their midst nor  to him nor us to see him meet in England the thousands who  had entered into the New Covenant which God through his mission  had mad[e] unto Israel.    This was one of the most interesting  Conference I ever attended abroad and this day was fullfilled  a prophecy which I gave in the House of the Lord in Kirtland  in 1837 that I should attend a Conference with Elder Milton Holmes  in the British Isles.    On the 3rd day after our conference I  took the railway cars from Manchester to Bradford where I  arrived at noon and in the afternoon, Elijah F Sheets arrived  from Leeds. He had come over from America with  Elders Stratten and Davis. We were truly glad to meet  each other on a foreign shore and to attend meetings together  in the evening with the Saints of that place. Brother  Sheets was presiding over the Bradford Conference.    The next day in company with  Elders Sheets and Ure presidents of the Bradford and Sheffield  Conferences I left ^walke[d]^ to Idle in Yorkeshire three miles from Bradford  to pay    A Visit to the Grave of Lorenzo Barnes    When we arrived about halfway we had a fair view  of Idle and the Churchyard where for a season was laid  the remains of our beloved brother until the brethren of the  household of faith to which he belonged removed the dust of  the honoured dead to his native land and laid it in the  burial place of the Saints.

 Elder W. Woodruff said "you brethren have got  good counsel, in relation to keeping yourselves pure, yourselves  and from women, also from tobacco, drink &c. Get  journals & if not ink get a pencil, and begin to   keep a jouranl; write a little every day; it will  be worth gold to you some day, you will value it  highly and it will preserve history in this church.  We in the historian's office ransack creation to get  historical matter. Attend your prayers; read the   bible and our sacred books; show them from the  Bible their never was a church without apostles.  you shew it from the Bible, Look out for pick -  pockets - they steal your watch, and your purse  and you will never realizethey have touched you.   Change your paper money at New York for  Sovereigns. Have your meetings at night & in the morning. 
 We had a beautiful green vale to pass through before   arriving at Idle which is on the top of a hill. The fields of grass  were as green as in May though it was but February which gave  the landscape around us a picturesque and verdant charm. We  were walking on the road which our departed brother had walked over  many scores of times to preach the Gospel of Jesus and I felt  sorrowful and filled with meditation.    Arriving at Idle containing a population of   seven thousand inhabitants and a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-Day Saints numbering 37 members we called upon   Elder Thomas Cordingly and family who had the care of Elder  Barnes through his sickness and death. They pointed out  to me the house and room where he passed ^t^his^e^ last hours of   his mortal life.    After partaking of some refreshments we  walked to the Churchyard and reverently gazed upon the peaceful silent  grave of our beloved brother. My feelings were sensitive and   sad. As I stood upon his grave I realised that I was standing  over the body of one of the Elders of Israel of the "horns of Joseph,"  one of the members of " Zion's Camp" who travelled more than   one thousand miles in 1834 for the redemption of his persecuted  and afflicted brethren ready to lay down his life for their sakes  and whose fidelity was a strong trait of character.    While standing upon his grave I offered  up my vocal prayer to Israel's God that I might die the death  of the righteous when called away and that my last end might  be as safe as our beloved and departed brother's and that his sacred  dust might be called forth in the morn of the First Resurrection. 
 advantages to be derived from   investment in Utah should ^cause^  the investigation and consequent   immigration needed to build   up both the territory and   the State, to ^the high plane to^ which you as   a public spirited man and   the leader of your sect   desire to have them elevated.    I submit this proposi-  tion without further remark,   to your consideration. To my   mind the advantages of the   publication suggested are   quite apparent; I trust   they will prove equally so   in your idea. Our space   rates are $200. a   column or $1000. a   page (7 columns.)    I leave tonight for   Butte, where I will be (at   The Butte Hotel) until the   end of the week. An answer to   me there, or to the Examiner Business   Office, San Francisco, will be greatly appreciated   by yours sincerely,    Ed. F. Moran 
 Elder Willford Woodruff addressed the saints; eulagized there  on the extent of their improvements since he last visited them. These  vallies of the mountains are almost the only place on the earth where  peace reigns. Our object in all that we do should be to build up  the kingdom of God with our substance and not place our hearts upon  it to idolize; if we ^desire to^ gather gold let it be the golden grain from our  fields, and then let us take good care of it, that our wives and children  may have plenty of bread when famine shall spread dismay among  all nations. Cultivate the earth, take care of your flocks and herds,  let the holy spirit of God dwell in you, and then you will be  contended and happy, and have no disposition to go to the mines to   seek it there. 
 Elder W. Woodruff counselled the  brethren to keep a journal, & get a knowledge   of kingdoms; countries &c, referred to his writing   the Sermons of the Presidency & Prophet; exhorted   to keep out the Snares bro. Taylor referred to. 
 (Pres.) Elder W. Woodruff came in and was informed of  the business done. He addressed the missionaries on journal keeping   keeping themselves pure and holy, and setting examples before  the people. reminded the brethren that they would be  remembered in the prayer circles. Etc. Etc. Etc. 
 Historian's Office,  P. O. BOX 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, 17 June 1886    Albert D. Hager, Esq.,  Sec. Chicago Historical Society    Dear Sir—Yours of May 1 was received,  but in consequence of the unsettled state of the things in  this territory, owing to the crusade upon the Mormon  people by federal officers, it was overlooked for a time.    Mr. A. B. Deming made no arrangement  with me to have any publications forwarded to   you, or to the Chicago Historical Society. Possibly  he made some arrangement with some other   party.    We have no books belonging to this office which  I could send you, that I am aware of, with the  exception of the "Mormon Women's Protest," which  has been published for distribution, and of which  I mail you a copy.    The "Deseret News" office, and the "Juvenile Instruc-  tor office, are the two offices where Latter-day-Saint  works are published in this city. They have a number  of works on hand, and would be pleased to furnish  you with lists.    Regretting that I cannot answer you more satisfactorily,  I remain, Respectfully Yours, W. Woodruff.

 Meditating upon his life I retired from the grave of Elder Barnes in company  with my brethren who had come with me to pay our reverant respect  and remembrance of our departed brother and on our return to the  family who attended him in his last moments I made enquiries  and obtained the following information    The Cause Sickness & Death of Lorenzo Barnes    One day in the latter part of September 1843  Elder Barnes walked very fast for about thirteen miles to  reach the railway station in time to take the cars. Some  part of the way he ran and got into a high state of perspiration  and only had time step into the train just as it was starting  He rode on the railroad for about twenty miles during which  time he became entirely chilled which thro ^gave^ him a severe cold  that settled upon his lungs and brought on quick consumption  from which he never recovered. He attended conference and preached  several times afterwards but was very feble. The last time  he preached was from the passage—"There remaineth therefore  a rest for the people of God." After he was confined to his  bed he was asked if he would have a physician but answered  "No." If he died he would die a natural death. If he lived  he should live unto the Lord if he died he should die unto the  Lord. He manifested a great desire to live if it should be  the will of God that he might return to Nauvoo. He was  deprived of his reason during some portion of the time and his  whole conversation on such intervals would be about Nauvoo  how he should yet there and his friends. He spoke of his  mother frequently. The night before his death he had his  reason and he then bore a strong and faithful testimony of the  truth of the fulness of the Gospel as taught by the Latterday Saints 
 I also learned that Elder Barnes suffered by going with  poor boots and wet feet from place to place. He was slow to make his  wants known to the brethren and some were slow to administer to them  until he got sick. Every attention however was paid to him after he  was confined to his bed but then it was too late.    I enquired if there were any writings left by   him such as Journals &c but could find nothing excepting several  fragments of a correspondence in poetry between himself and his intended  wife which showed the strong fidelity of his heart so characteristic  of the man throughout every action of his life. These fragments I  copied from his M.S. into my daily Journal.    I preached to a good congregation at Idle that evening  and the next day in company with Elders Sheets and Ure and Abraham  Lord the presiding Elder of the Idle Branch I returned to Bradford.    The brethren placarded the town with the following  notice:    Conference: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints will hold their Conference in the Philadelphia Chapel North Wing  Bradford on Sunday Feb 23rd 1844; to commence at ten o'clock in the  morning two in the afternoon and six in the evening; when there will  be present on the occassion two Americans, one of whom belongs to  the quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Also there will be preaching on the   fulness of the everlasting gospel as revealed by an angel of the Lord in  these last days on the following ^evenings^ Monday Tuesday and Wednesday  in the said chapel to commence at eight o'clock each evening. N. B.  People of all Persuasions are invited to attend.    This Conference was duly held according to   notice of which I here give the epitome. 
 Bradford Quarterly Conference  held in the   Philadelphia Chapel Bradford Yorkshire  Feb 23 1845    Present: Wilford Woodruff of the Quorum of the Twelve 1 High Priest  1 Seventy 9 Elders 9 Priests 6 Teachers and 4 Deacons    Elijah F. Sheets the President of the conference  was called to the chair and Priest Beecroft chosen clerk.    The meeting being duly opened the Conference  was represented consisting of three Branches—Bradford Leeds  and Idle numbering in the whole 168 members.    There was a good number of the Saints  gathered together and an excellent band of music in front of the  pulpit accompanied the singers. In the morning Elder Woodruff  addressed the meeting.    The chapel in the afternoon was crowded  with the Saints and citizens. Sacrament was administered  and I again addressed the congregation but was somewhat interupted  by a man intoxicated who had been cut off the church.    In the evening we again had a crowded  house and the music and singing which commenced our service  was inspiring. It fell to my lot once more to address the  congregation during the evening and I took for my text the  XIV of Rev 6 7 & 8 verses. In my discourse I gave an account of  the rise and progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints the leading mind of Joseph Smith how he was called of God  by the administration of angels and traced the subject through to  the sealing of his testimony with his blood.    I spoke for the space of one hour with  the power of God and the congregation was as still as death and  a most intense interest prevailed. During the Conference 
 I confirmed 4 persons blessed 3 children and laid hands upon twelve persons for   the healing of their infirmaties.    Two days afterwards I returned to Liverpool stoping  on the way several hours at Manchester which I spent with Elder Holmes.    March the 1st was my birthday and I was thirty eight   years of age and in Liverpool presiding over the British Mission and with me  my wife.    An Attempt to Rob the Church of the Copyright of  The Book of Doctrine and Covenants    On my birthday I received a letter from a friend  containing the copy of a letter dated Pittsburgh Jan 30, 1845 written by  John Greenhow to his father in Kendal stating that he was getting the  Doctrine and Covenants stereotyped in Pittsburg and that he was going to  bring the plates to England to print the work here and get the copyright secured  so that the Church could not print them it.    This was indeed a bold move of the apostates to  undertake to undertake to print the works of the Church and such a  book as the Doctrine and Covenants which is the second standard work of the  Church and I viewed it as nothing less than the providence of God  which ^put^ the knowledge of this design to rob the Church of the copyright  into my hands. I spent the day in examining the law of   England upon the securing of copyright.    I spent the forepart of the following day at  home and the afternoon with Elders Hedlock and Ward upon whom at this  time I laid my hands and ordained as my counsellors and they then  laid their hands upon me and blessed me. Afterwards we partook  of the sacrament together and then we called upon God our Father to  bless us and frustrate the designs of our enemies and overthrow the  designs ^plans^ which they had laid to rob the Church and injure the cause 
 of God.    I wrote President Young giving him account of the  affairs of the mission and informed him of the deep laid scheme  of those at Pittsburg, America, John Greenhow Samuel Benett  and others to rob the Church of the copyright of the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants. I also wrote to the Secretary at  Stationers Hall to secure the Copyright of the work myself for  the Church and wrote to brother Curedon to send me a copy   of the Doctrine and Covenants.    Preston Quarterly Conference was held   on Sunday the 9th of March at which myself and Elder Ward  attended. Elder John Banks was called to the chair. During  the day Elder Leonard Hardy was chosen to preside over the  Conference and there were eleven Branches represented with 505  members.    Next day I took a walk through the city and  visited the old Cockpit where Elders Kimball and Hyde had  preached so much at the first opening of the British mission and  where also Dr Willard Richards afterwards also preached.    We walked up and down the river where  many hundred of the Saints had been baptized and I also viewed  ^from where^ the Scotch made an attack upon the English at Preston when the   gallant enthusiastic followers ^army^ of the Young Pretender made their illfated  and mad attempt to unseat the first George from the English  throne and give it to their bonnie Charle ^[Washed] it the house of the Stuarts^. Some of the Scotch  entered the town as far as the Cockpit but most of them was  slain in the valley. I saw their burial place. There is now a   grove growing over their bodies. This was in the year 1745  just one hundred years before this date.    We returned to the town and after dinner  I took the parting hand of Elders Banks and Hardy and the  Saints of Preston and returned to Liverpool. 
 Lord Nelson's Monument Liverpool.    In company with my wife and Sisters Clark and Haywood  I visited Nelson's Monument the design of which was made by Mathew  Charles Wyatt of London and was executed in bronze by Richard  Westmacott also of London and the pedestal of Hendal Marble by  Messrs Hetherington and Webster of Liverpool. The subscription  to build it commenced on the 15th of Nov 1805 and ^was^ completed the same  year amounting to £9000 and the first stone was laid July 15th 1812.    The principal figure is Admiral Nelson  resting one foot on a conqured enemy and the other on a cannon his eye  stedfast and upraised to Victory from whom he is receiving a fourth  naval crown upon his swoard held in his left hand indicating the loss of  his right which is concealed by the flag which the genius of Victory  is lowering over him. Under the folds of this flag Death lies  in ambush indicating that he received the reward of Victory and the   stroke of Death at the same time. There is an enraged British  sailor represented symbolizing the zeal of the navy to revenge the loss of its  most illustrious chief, and in the back ground is Britannia leaning on  her sphere and shield with lauarral in her hand but she ^is^ regardless of them  representing the country's pride and anguish over the triumph so darly  purchased.    Around the upper moulding of the pedestal are  inscribed Nelson's ever memorable words—"England expects every man  to do his duty". At the base of the pedestal are four figures in  chains as captives emblematical of the four great victories he achieved and  the space between these figures on the sides of the pedestal is filled by four  grand bass reliefs executed in bronze ^also^ representing those glorious  victories—namely, St Vincent 14 Feb. 1797; Nile 1st Aug. 1798;  Copenhagen 2nd of April 1801; Trafalgar 21st of Oct. 1805. The  figures are all of the proportion of seven feet. Lord Nelson was 
 born Sep. 29, 1758.    The whole range of the buildings called The Exchange  cost £110,848; Flaging £36,000; Town Hall £156,000.  After visiting this monument we went through several  of the principal ^streets^ and viewed them and then returned home.    The day following which was the 13th  I took the steamer Commodore for Glasgow in company with  Elders Hedlock Ward and Banks and arrived at the mouth of  the river Clyde at 6 o'clock next morning.    We passed Gourock, Greennock, Port Glasgow  Dumbarton at the mouth of the river Leven at which stands the   rock so noted in Scotish history and called Dumbarton Castle  on which is stationed a regiment of soldiers to protect the river  Clyde.    We had a fair view of Bell's monument  errected in memory of John Bell who was the first to run a steamer  up the river Clyde to Glasgow which is confined to its banks  by a stone wall for sixteen miles.    The Highlands were covered with snow  and we arrived in Glasgow in the midst of a severe snowstorm.    In the evening we held a Council with   the officers of the Branch and two days afterwards which was  the 16th we held    The Glasgow Conference  at the Odd Fellow's Hall Glasgow    The meeting was called to order by Elder  Peter McCue was called to the chair and aAfter singing and  prayer 15 Branches of the Church wasere represented containing  1065 members 35 Elders 51 Priests 37 Teachers 24 Deacons.  Wm Gibson was clerk of the Conference.    During the day the vast assembly 
 of the Saints was addressed by Elders Hedlock Ward Banks and myself. I  felt much interested in this my first visit and Conference among the Scotish Saints    Next day I called ^took the^ rail to Coats Bridge and thence went  to Whifflett and held a Council with the officers of that Branch and the following  morning I took a walk to visit Dunbyvan Iron Works. From thence we visited ^walked^  ^to Ashley and called upon the brethren there and then visited^ the extensive Calder Banks Mallable Iron Works    I next visited the Ardrie Museum  collected and kept by Mr James Myrdock antiquarian. After taking  some refreshments with him he showed us each appartment of the Museum  and among the many curiosities I had a view of coins from about 1000  years before Christ down to the present day. Among the rest were  coins bearing the names and profile of Pallios 1000 B.C. Antonius,  Vespersion Caesar, Servius, Christianna, Comodus, Posthumus,  Artaxus, Tragin, Domician, Antonius, Gordian, Auridian, Hiradien,  Claudius Caesar, and Pius.    There was quite a collection of natural History  and three and half tons of precious books as a liberary. I saw  also a ^metal pot^ bearing this inscription: "One Hundred and   twenty years after Christ. I belong to St. Lawrence." I also saw  three gold and silver Roman crosses stolen by travellers from the   Vatican at Rome, 300 years old, besides a number of weapons of war  and paintings of ancient date.    Afterwards we called at a brothers house and I  laid hands upon six who were sick and blessed twenty persons who pled  with me to let them have a blessing under the hands of an Apostle.  I   preached in the evening to a crowded house and afterwards walked to   brother Carruthers and spent the night.    I dreamt a rattlesnake bit me on the ancle but I  pulled him off squezed him to death and much poison ran out of  him. The interpretation was that when we arrived at Edinborough  I should be opposed by [blank] for appointing  John Banks to preside over that Branch and Conference of the  Church. 
 Returning to Glasgow and joining Elders Hedlock and  Ward we took the rail to Castle Carery and thence by coach to Sterling  and as we came in sight of it among the mountains we had a fine  view of the famed Sterling Castle which brought to mind the heroic  Wallace & the royal Bruce in their renowned wars to free Scotland from  the English yoke. Sterling Castle was taken by Wallace in  one of his most famous acts.    Arriving at Sterling we called upon  Elder Daniel Sutherland in John Street and took supper and  then called upon John Gillies 76 years of age. He was the third  man in the formation of the 92 Ilanders was in the army for  21 years and embraced the Gospel in the 73 year of his age  I had an interesting conversation with him during the evening  and we spent the night at his house.    Sterling Castle.    Next morning with brothers Hedlock Ward  and Gillies we visited Sterling castle and went through every appartment  of it. As we passed up the avenue leading to the castle  we closely examined the palace of Mary Queen of Scots and the King's  stables and went into them!    In going through the old castle we saw  the armoury and old flags and many things of antiquity We   went into the Chaple of John Knox and closely examined the oak  pulpit in which he preached and where he baptized Prince Henry  I brought away a small piece of the pulpit and stood upon the  exatct spot where the fierce Scotish reformer Knox stood and   preached his first sermon. Here I also saw the place in  the old church where stood the Twelve Apostles in stone figures  which Knox destroyed before commencing his sermon and fierce  denunciation against popery and image worship. We also had  a view of the habitation of the Earl of Lecester in 1639 and  Cemens Hospital and the place where James the VI was crowned  We had a pleasant view of Sterling Castle and the surrounding   country from its heights. 
 While at Sterling I laid my hands upon the veteran John  Gillies and blessed him and ordained him an Elder and on the third day  from our arrival we took steamboat for Edinborough where we arrived at  seven oclock and after taking some refreshments at Henry McEwan's the  Presiding Elder we went to the meeting    This was the first time I had ever been in Edinborough  and the Edinborough Conference of the Church was in a divided state for  many aspiring spirits were there and had been manifested for a length  of time. I prayed God to give us wisdom to set this Conference  in order.    Edinborough Castle.  Next day we viewed the renowned city of Edinborough  and visited its castle and went through each appartment of it. From the  Castle we had a splendid view of the city of Edinborugh and surrounding  country for many miles. The rock itself which forms the site of  the castle is three hundred and eighty ^3^ feet above the level of the sea and  is accessable only on the eastern side the other sides being nearly perpendicular.    The castle is of great antiquity and has been held  as a fortress from the earliest times. In 1093 it was besieged by Donald  ^Bane^ brother to King Malcolm; taken by the English in 1296, retaken and  demolished by Randolph 1313, rebuilt by Edward the III of England,  surprised by Wm. Douglas 1341, and by Albany in 1482; taken  by the Regent Murray from Mary Queen of Scots, his half sister, in 1573;  by Cromwell in 1650 and by William the III of Englandin 1689.    The Scotish Regalia are kept in the castle.  They were placed there in 1707 and discovered in an oken chest in the   crown room in 1818. This is King David's crown, first King of   Scotland.    I also inspected the celebrated piece of artilary  called Mons Meg cast at Mons in Flanders. It was used in the  seige of Norham and afterwards burst in firing a salute to the Duke  of York on his visit to the castle in 1682. It was forged in  1486 out of large bars of iron. Its weight was seven and half tons  and it carried 268 pound shot, the bore was twenty inches and 
 its length fifteen feet.    After visiting the Armoury and going through  each appartment of the castle and taking the splendid views of   the surrounding country we left and visited other portions of the  city and among the rest saw The old house where John  Knox the Scotish Reformer was born May 2nd 1505 and  died Nov 24, 1572.    Visit to the Palace of Holyrood    We next visited the palace of Holyrood. It occupies the  site of an Abbey which was founded by David the I. in 1128  and which was one of the richest religious establishments in Scotland.    In the chapel ^of the palace^ were deposited the remains of David II; James II; Prince  Arthur third son of James IV; James V; Magdalene his queen;  Arthur Second son of James V, and Henry Darnley. The  ruins of what is now called the Chapel Royal is worthy of notice.    The Picture Gallery of Holyrood which  is 156 feet long by 27 1/2 wide and 20 feet in height contains  the potriats of the Scotish monarchs.    In the palace are preserved several relics  of the unfortunate Queen Mary of Scotts. I saw her workbox  visited her bed chamber and saw the bed and furniture and the  chair occupied by her when married and also visited her dressing  room both of which was hung with the most splendid ancient tapestry.    I saw the hiding palace of Lord Darnley  and his associates when they murdered David Rizzio Mary's musician  and the place where the victim fell and the stain of his blood  which yet remains. I also saw the armour worn by Lord   Darnley at the time of the murder and I put on Darnley's steal  head dress which was heavy. 
 We visited each appartment of this palace of Kings one of  which was the s[t]ate room of George the IV where was his throne and portrait  in his highland dress by David Wilkey and among the curiosities of this  chief dwelling place of Scotland's royality I saw the bones of the kings in  the vault pilled up together. Cromwell took away their coffins and left  their bones scattered upon the ground. Here was the end of human  greatness symbolized in a nations royal burrial place in the Palace of  its kings.    We called upon one of the brethren after our visit to  Holyrood and having taken dinner started out again to view other  portions of the city. Sir Walter Scotts Monument is a splendid  specimen of art.    On the following day we held conference in  the city.    The Edinborough Conference  of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  Sunday March 23, 1845    Present: One of the Twelve Apostles 3 High Priests 8 Elders 16 Priests  and four Teachers. R. Hedlock was chosen President and Priest  Braley Clerk.    Conference having been opened with singing and prayer  eleven Branches were represented as the Edinborough Conference containing  409 members 13 Elders 22 Priests 8 Teachers 1 Deacon and 9  baptized since the last Conference.    The morning was taken up in teaching principle  in the afternoon the Church partook of the Sacrament after which Elder John  Banks was appointed President of the Edinborough Conference and also the  Edinborough Branch and Henry McEwen presiding Elder over two or three  Branches under Elder John Banks. In the evening I preached 
 to an attentive congregation.    A company of young men who called themselves  the Nauvoo Legion escorted us out to see the city next morning and they  led us to the very top of the high cliff known as Arthur's Seat which  was the highest peak of rocks anywhere in this region and a good part  of the way up was almost perpendicular. I was informed that  Elder Orson Pratt while he was establishing the Branch in Edinborough  which he found about as difficult as we did the establishing of the  work in London, would frequently go to the top of this rock as a  place of retreat and meditation.    From this rock we had a full view of  the whole city of Edinborough and the surrounding country which  presented to us a sublime prospect. I was quite unwell with  a severe cold and and felt wearied in reaching the top of this rock  or Arthours Seat which was also the case with the rest of the brethren  as far as fatigue was concerned.    When we had sufficiently viewed the  country around we returned took dinner and then visited several  of the Saints and in the evening we held a council meeting  of the officers.    The day after we parted with the Saints,   in Edinborough took the rail to Glasgow where we spent 3 hours  with the brethren then continued by rail to Grenock and  thence by steamboat for Liverpool. Elder Hedlock and  myself were together; brother Ward had been left in Edinborough  by accident.    We had a disagreable night on board and  I arrived in Liverpool sick and weary and for several day continued  unwell and mostly unfit for business.    On my return I received several of  numbers of the Times and Seasons and Neighbour and  the New York Prophet also a letter from Elder George  A Smith. 
 Liverpool Conferance  held in  The Music Hall Liverpool  Sunday the 30th of March 1845    Present: One of the Twelve 4 High Priests 18 Elders 13 Priests and  eight Teachers. Joseph A Stratton was appointed President  and James S. Cantwell clerk.    The representation of the Elders showed that  at this date the Liverpool Conference comprised 12 Branches with  676 members 30 Elders 39 Priests 21 Teachers 10 Deacons and  31 baptized since the last Quarterly Conference. Brothers Brown  and Wilson were chosen deliagates to the coming General Conference  of the British mission.    On the First of the month I wrote a large sheet full  of matter to President Brigham Young concerning the affairs  of the Church over which I was presiding and the progress of the  work in Europe.    Rumours of wars between England and the  United States were again heard through the land. The American  Government having anexed Texas to the United States there seemed  a prospect of England joining Mexico in a war. Quite an  excitement was created among the American captains in  consequence of the English Government having stoped the steampacket  which was to sail on the 4th until furthar orders.    On the 4th I took the train with Mrs  Woodruff for Manchester and was met at the station there  by Elders Stratton Holmes and Ross 
 Next day I had an interview with many  Elders as delegates from the various Conferences and among the  number were Elder Elisha H Davis from London and Elder Dan  Jones from Wales.    General Conference of the British Mission  of  The Church of Jesus Christ of L. D S.  held inat  Manchester in the Hall of Science Camfield  April the 6th 1845    This was our yearly General Conference of the various  Conferences of the Church throughout the United Kingdom of  Great Britain and which was held as in America on the anaversary  of the Rise of the Church.    A large assembly of Saints and friends  came together at an early hour. Elder Woodruff presided  supported by his counsellors Reuben Hedlock and Thos Ward.    After the Conference was duly opened the  President called upon the delegates to represent the various conferences  of the British Mission which occupied the forenoon. It was  much the largest representation ever given in England up to this  date notwithstanding our emigrations.    The afternoon was occupied by the Delegates  in representing the condition of their Conferences and the evening  was spent in the same manner and the Hall was filled with  a large assembly.    At the close of the evening I occupied  a few moments as delegate from America in representing  my Conference consisting of the United States containing 
 one Quorum of the Twelve Apostles one High Council, 300 High Priests,  1050 of the Seventies 5000 Elders and about the same number of Priests Teachers  and Deacons and about one hundred thousand members including the  officers generally in very good standing, having built several towns and  one city with a population of 15,000 souls, built two Temples and laid  the foundation of another suffered much persecution and 50 or more of  its members had sealed their testimony with their blood but still it was in  a good state of prosperity.    General Conference re-assembled next morning at 10  o'clock at Mr Haywood's Room the usual meeting place of the Church at  Manchester and the first business presented was the Joint Stock Company  A committee of ten was chosen to withdraw from the body of the  Conference and form an instrument in writing as a Constitution for the  society.    The Committee of the Joint Stock Company  accordingly withdrew and sat in Council most of the time for 24  hours and while that was going on the President and his counsellors  continued the business of the General Conference in making changes  of Elders giving appointments settling difficulties and putting  things generally in order.    The two last days of the conference was occupied  mostly with the business of the Joint Stock Company and at the close Elders  Elisha H Davis & Elijah F. Sheets were ordained into the quorum of the Seventies  and T. D. Brown to the office of Elder under the hands of Elders Woodruff  Ward and Clark.    Wilford Woodruff President  Thomas Ward Clerks  JB Meynell [Clerks] 
 Having spent the intermediate time to the 15th in and  around Manchester visiting the Churches and the Saints at their homes myself  and wife returned to Liverpool. Here I found letters at the office for me  two of which was from President Young and P. P. Pratt. These letters were  full of public interest and brother Brigham's spoke of the progress of  the Temple and affairs of Nauvoo.    The Maynooth Grant    On the 21st I attended a meeting appointed by the minister  of the Church of England for the purpose of opposing the Maynooth  Grant which was then under discussion in the British Parliament  The whole country was in an excitement upon the matter and alarm  was created throughout the Protestant Churches of England. The meeting  was held in the Music Hall where the Saints held their services and  the celebrated Rev Hugh McNeile was chairman. The speakers  considered that Parliament was betraying the country and striking  a death blow at the three hundred years of reformation. Many addresses  were made and resolutions formed and the meeting broke up at  half past ten.    I spent the 23rd at the Office examining the  and aranging the trunk and relics of our departed friend and brother  Lorenzo D. Barnes. I carefully filed all his corresepondence and packed  in his trunk together with his own compositions Journals Patriarchal  Blessings &c also a dozen or more of choice coin of ancient date and  characters which he probably collected for the Nauvoo Museum  with one weight the standard for a soverign and his finger ring all  of which I carefully put in a package and sealed it with wax and  stamped it with a large seal.    Upon the outside  of this package I wrote the contents and directed it to the  President of the Church in Nauvoo. Besides this I packed  his carpet bag a splendid Buffalo robe worked with Indian beads  overcoat dress coat various other clothing 2 cases of razors two 
 pocketbooks containing deeds of land and other papers a crown piece in a small  pocket book for the Museum at Nauvoo and a variety of other things all of which  I carefully packed to be sent to Nauvoo.    A Dream.    After retiring to rest this night I fell asleep and dreamt that I  had just returned to Nauvoo from my English mission and was in company  with a number of the Twelve and other brethren. We met with Joseph  the Prophet and I shook hands with him and asked him if he and his  family were well. He said they were. I thought the endowment  had been given and he was counselling us about taking a mission  abroad. While talking he sat in a chair and leaned upon his breast  He said he was going to take a mission to India and pointed out the  man to go with him but I cannot now call him by name. George  A. Smith asked liberty of Joseph to spend more time with me that  we might be prepared to take a mission together which was granted  Orson Pratt had his mission appointed but I do not know where;  Lyman Wight was spoken of but I do not recollect what was said.  We had an interesting time together and all seamed happy to  see the Prophet again.    ToombStone of Lorenzo D Barnes    I sent to Elder E. F. Sheets the following Epitah for the  toombstone:    "In memory of Lorenzo D. Barnes who died on the  20th of December 1842 aged 30 years. He was a native of the  United States an Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  Day Saints a member of the High Priest Quorum and also of  Zions Camp in A.D. 1834 and the first Gospel Messenger  from Nauvoo who has found a grave in a foreign land. 
 Sleep on Lorenzo but ere long from this  The conquered toomb shall yeild her captive prey  Then with thy Quorum shat thou reign in bliss  As King and Priest for an eternal day.    The same evening I rode to Newton in company  with Bro James Ferguson and here I stayed with that Branch of  Saints for several days.    During my stay at Newton I with several  friends went to see the Muspratt vitrol works carried on in  their various branches. It is one of the most lucrative businesses  in the world but very disagreeable and unhealthy. The fires are  fed with brimstone and the smoke of the whole works is carried  off through a brick chimney 138 feet in circumferance and 396  in height and often the air is so impregnated in the dirrection  that the smoke goes even at a great distance that one can  only with difficulty breathe in it.    After leaving these works I visited each  appartment of the Newton Engine factory where a large number  of engines are made for the railroad. We had several of the  brethren at work there who could carry on the business in all its branches.    From the Newton Engine Factory I  walked several miles through a very pleasant scenery surrounded  with green fields hedges trees and gardens and visited the Church. On  the side of the building was the figure of a pig in stone with  a stone hung around its neck. The tradition is that the materials  for the Church was drawn to another place quite a distance  from where the Church now stands and the pig came along and  took a stone in his mouth and carried it along squeeling and  laid it down where the Church now stands. The people  took it as an omen that they should build the Church there  and they did.    I returned from my walk to Bro Nuttall's 
 laid hands upon his sick child had prayers with the Saints and departed  for Liverpool.    In the beginning of May I visited the Churches  at Preston and Blackburn and with brother Speakman on the 5th  I walked from the latter place to Whalley and visited its old Abbey  which was the largest I had ever been into. It covered several acres  of ground & was nearly in total ruins except a small portion of it  which is inhabited by a few families. The Abbey is 800 years  old and was built A.D. 1,000.    Stoneyhurst—The Jesuits College    Next day Brother Speakman and myself walked to  Stoneyhurst and went through every appartment of the Jesuits  College which was the only college of the kind in England  We inspected each department of the rare and splendid paintings  and of the library which was very extensive containing many  very ancient writings and parchment manuscripts. There  was the prayer book of Mary Queen of England and a copy  of St. Paul's Epistles one thousand years old. We went  through their museum studies lodgings chapels &c containing  many rare and curious things. There were many paintings  and figures of Christ and some of the images of the Saviour  on the cross in fine marble cost £700. We went into  the chapel of the boys educated there and also into the main  chapel one of the windows of which with the paintings of the  Twelve Apostles on it cost two thousand pounds and  the candlesticks crosses and all the furnature were very choice  and costly.    We visited each part of the gardans which wer devided  by walks bordered by the ewe tree which formed the whole into departments. This  ewe tree border was about 4 feet thick 12 feet high and from 40 to 200 feet long  varying in the departments and these borders were as straight and smooth as a  plastered wall. 
 After going through this noted College and its gardens  we walked to Waddington and visited the Almshouses built and  dedicated by Sir Robert Parker in 1,700. to the poor widows of  the parish. There were twenty five dwellings and a small  garden to each. These houses were occupied by aged widows  the youngest of whom was sixty years of age and the oldest  87. They appeared quite comfortable. We stoped at Waddington for the night    Thence next day to Clithero then to  Chatburn and we walked through the street that the Apostle  Heber C. Kimball walked through with his hat off and  blessed the place. I felt the Spirit of God rest upon me  while walking over the same road.    A Day at Fishing    I went fishing the following day  with Father Richard Smithies in the river Ribble. He was  70 years of age and was considered the greatest fisherman in that country  He fished with the fly and it being the first time I had ever  witnessed it I was delighted with this ingenious art of fishing and  the dexterity of the fisherman. The fishing rod was about  14 feet long very slender and his long fine line made of hair and  catgut was wound round a small brass wheel with a little crank to it  and fastened to the but end of the pole. The line then runs through  half a dozen brass rings or ilot holes fastened at regular distances  along the rod to the small end of it. On the line are  five or six artificial flies about two feet apart fastened by  catgut almost as fine as a hair. Twenty or thirty feet of the  line is unwound from the reel at the but of the rod and thrown  upon the water and the fly hooks swim down the stream and  the trout thaking them as natural flies are hooked as  soon as they bite. If they are large trout and run, they  of themselves unwind as much line as they want from the  reel and when the fish are thus worried in the water until they  struggle no longer the fisherman draws them to the bank  by the line or to himself if he stands in the water and 
 then with a small hand-net on a pole of 5 or 6 feet puts it under the trout & very  deliberatly takes it out of the water. The fishermen have flies varying  for almost every month imitating the natural flies which swim upon the  water at the time they fish. These flies are made of feathers of birds  of different colours and the trout will often take them before the natural  fly.    Father Smithies caught 7 trout and 2 cheven  I was much gratified with the days fishing and after our return  Sister Parkinson cooked the trout which made a good meal.    Clithero Quarterly Conference  Held Sunday the 11th of May 1845    Elder Speakman was called to preside. The Churches were  represented some a[l]terations made and officers ordained in the morning  In the afternoon sacrament was administered and the power of  God rested so abundantly upon the congregation that many were  melted into tears.    This is the Conference brother Kimball speaks  of in his Journal. I do not wonder that he wept when he left  them for I was myself so overwhelmed with the spirit and power  of God and simplicity of the people that I could scarcely speak  They were like little children and as pure minded and inocent as   angels. Many of them bore their testimony to the work of God.    I returned next day to Preston and there met  Elders Holmes and Hardy and preached at night from the CII  Psalm and on the day after I reached Liverpool.    I stayed at home but two days and  then started to attend the Carlisle Conference. I took the steamer  for Carlisle at 4 p.m. on the 15th and as the boat was newly 
 painted from stem to stern and one could not touch ^or sit^ anywhere without carrying  away the paint my last resort was to pay 2 shillings for the use of a  bunk among the Sailors. I had no sooner gone below than I was  enveloped in the most horrid stench I ever smelt arising from the  cargo consisting of goano. I laid down but was as sick as death  and vomitted at intervals for five hours and my stomach being empty  I strained at such a degree that blood ran out of my nose almost  a stream. I suffered much through the night and the sailors  smoked their pipes and filled the place with tobaco smoke which  though nacious to me was better than the stench of the cargo. I  thought it the most horrid night I ever spent at sea.    We arrived at Port Carlisle at 9 o'clock in  the morning. I then crossed the ferry and took the canal boat to  Carlisle.    With brothers Kent and Allen the next  day I went through the town of Carlisle. It was anciently walled  in with a high strong wall most of which was taken down in  building the city. We walked upon some portion of the  walls which still stood and visited the old St. Marys Church and  Abbey about eleven hundred years of age. Portions of the Church  was the ancient building itself and the remainder had been repaired  We also visited the Carlisle Castle which gave us a fair view of  the surrounding country and among other things of note with which  we made ourselves acquainted was a very valuable painting by  Edward Rancier which we saw at Mr Charles Thurnum's  Stationer's shop. It represented a blacksmith in the act of  shoeing a bay horse with a donkey by his side and a dog sitting  on the ground with the tool box anvil tools &c scattered around  It was such a life picture that it seemed more than a mere  painting. Five thousand pounds had frequently been offered  for it and refused. They sold the engravings for 5 pounds  each and it was supposed that no living artist except  Rancier could paint such a picture. 
 Carlisle Conference  held  In the Recabites Lodge Room Castle St. Carlisle  Sunday May the 18th    This conference had not met before for 4 years and  as it was somewhat a special meeting now Elder Woodruff was called to  the chair and Joseph Maughen clerk.    The representation showed the conference to consist  of the Branches of Carlisle Brampton Alston New Castle Sunderland and  Dunfries and containing 165 members.    The necessary business in putting the Churches  in order was attended to sacrament partaken of and in the evening  the president of the meeting preached to a crowded house upon the rise  and progress of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints  which closed the conference.    I parted from the Saints of Carlisle and  returned to Liverpool by the same steamer in which I came. It had  on board 400 sheep and some horses and cattle which nearly covered the entire  deck yet the sailors found space large enough to fight on. About  a dozen of them got at it which left many bloody noses and sore heads  We had a very good passage however.    On the 24th of May which was the seventh day of the week and on this the Sabbath day of ancient Israel  at 6 o'clock in the morning the last stone was laid on the Temple  of the Lord at Nauvoo with shouts of grace unto it. Glory to  God in the Highest who finished his work on the seventh day  and rested. So may the Saints rest! Thus I wrote in  my Journal upon  The Laying of the Last Stone of the Nauvoo Temple. 
 On the 6th of June I started by rail to London  upon the important Church business of securing the copyright of the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants. I left my family in Liverpool    Copyright of the Book of Doctrine & Covenants  Secured  by Wilford Woodruff at Stationers Hall England  June the 7th 1845    As refered to elsewhere in my autobiography I had received a  copy of a letter from John Greenhow to his father in England  stating that he was stereotyping the Book of Doctrine and Covenants  up the Chuch at an expence of $300 and that he would be in  England about the 1st of May when he should strike off a  few copies of the book and deprive us of the privilege of printing  it. This was to be kept a profound secret but through the  mercy of God the knowledge fell into my hands and I as  the lawful agent of the Church immediately employed a printer  and printed three thousand copies. And on this 7th of  June I secured the copyright of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants  in my own name at Stationers Hall London and carried  one copy according to law to the British Museum and  got my receipt for it.    I spent several weeks in London and while  there the case of Elder Albon was before the Church. He was the  minister of the Indipendant Connection whom we baptized at  the commencement of the work in London on my former mission  to England. He was brought to trial for resisting the order  and counsel of the Church and at a meeting on the 19th of  June when his case was brought up for the last time for  settlement he defended himself with a heart full of envy and  accusation but acknowledged what was brought against him 
 and said that he should continue his course baptizing on [blank] and  ordaining in his own way. A vote was taken and he was cut  off from the Church a second time.    While in London on this occassion I also revisited  many of the noted places and things of the city and subburbs and saw  some alterations and additions but the most famous of the fresh things  which I saw and which I had never visited before was    The Unrivalled Exhibition of Madame Tussaud  and Sons  Bazar Baker Street Portman Square    I have never in my travels seen anything which could  begin to compare with this exhibition. On entering I purchassed a  book of the contents of each room. Here were life representations  of the kings and queens of England for centuries with their courts at various  periods, also the kings and emperors of other nations of Europe with  a grand marshalling of celebrated poets orators and renowned men  of the earth with the due proportion of unenviable notorious characters  Among the rest stood our own Washington in his dress of state and  Byron Shakspeare Voltaire Luther Calvin Knox Wesley and  a host of like celebrities. And what makes the exhibition so  interesting is the fact that we find there not only the best possible  representations of the persons of the grand array of famous characters  but also the very dresses &c which they wore in life even to the  coronation robes of royalty with their diamonds stars precious stones  and all the gorgeous paraphernalia of everything famous in the  present and past. Here is Napoleon the 1st represented under  almost every circumstance of his life and the Sleeping Beauty  of France with her jewels and necklace of brilliants with her  bosom heaving with the soft regular breathing of sleep looking as natural  as life as does also the other figures. Indeed to such an extent 
 is this life like illusion sustained everwhere in this famous Bazaar that  visitors often find the novelty of taking these wax figures for living  persons. I myself was in one case particularly taken in with  the apparant life reality of a respectable old gentleman ^setting^ by my  side. The following is an extract of some of some of the  personages and things which I saw at the Bazaar of Madame  Tussaud and Sons.    First Group  in honour of her Majesty and the Duke of Wellington    1st Queen Victoria in full court costume. 2nd Prince Albert as fField  Marshal. 3rd the Duke of Wellington in his uniform.

The robe on the right under the looking glass was used  at the opening of Parliament that on the left was the purple or imperial  robe used on his Majestys return from the Abby. These three robes

Her Majesty is dressed in her royal  robes and seated on her throne having on her head the imperial crown and in her  hands the sceptre and orb. Near her is the Archbishop of Canterbury imploring a  blessing supported by the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of London. The throne  is the identical one under which George IV received the allied sovereigns and all  the figures are dressed in strict accordance with the regulations at the coronation  In this group there are also Nelson, the Right Honorable George Canning  Dukes of Newcastle Sutherland and Devanshire, Earl Grey Marquises of Londonderry  and Normonby Bishop of London in full dress and Queen Victoria  again.    The Fourth Group    represents the most celebrated characters of the late war including the  members of the Holy Alliance.    The figure pointing to the Eagle is Buonarparte; immediately behind him  is Marshal Ney and next to the pedestal is Murat the late king of Naples  behind them stand Prince Talleyrand and Roustan the favorite Mameluke 
 of Napoleon. The figure seated is the Emperor of Austria behind him next to  the pedestal is the King of Prussia and Blucher with the Emperor Alexandraer  of Russia offering on behalf of the Allied monarchs the kingdom of France. The  intention of this group is to show ^in view^ the principal actors in a which never had  a parallel and to give effect to the view the allied monarchs are supposed  to be offering to Napoleon the kingdom of France as it was under Louis XIV  (an historical fact) which he refuses prefering to risk the chance of war  against Europe in arms rather than give up his pretentions to universal  dominion. Napoleon, grasping the sword which won him empire points  to his favorite Eagle and determined to fulfil his destiny. The  Eagle surmounting the whole was presented by Napoleon to his Imperial  Guard and was taken at Waterloo by the Prussians under Von ^Blucher^  The Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary ^is^ in the uniform of the  Austrian Guards Alexander Emperor of Russia uniform of his guards  Frederic William III of Prussia do. and Field Marshal Von  Blucher in the uniform of the Prussian guards Napoleon in the  uniform of a chasseur of the Guard with the star of the Legion  of Honour taken from  life in the year 1815.

The celebrated and identical camp-bed used by Napoleon 7 years  at St. Hellena with the original mattress and pillows on  which he died. Here he is lying in state in his chasseur uniform  covered with the identical cloak worn by him at Marengo  and prized so highly that he expressly left it by will to his  son the king of Rome. In it he laid in soldier's glory and  it served as his pall to the grave. They paid for the bed  alone £550 for the Tussaud Bazaar. Here is the  coronation robe of Napoleon and also the coronation robe of  the Empress Josephine the train of which at her coronation was  borne by four queens. A figure of Napoleon in the identical  clothes worn by him at St Hellena, waistcoast smallclothes stockings  morning gown and sword belt. The celebrated flag of Elba which  Napoleon presented to the National Guards at Elba afterwards  used by him on his return to France. It was again presented  to his guard before the battle of Waterloo and was taken by  the Prussians. This flag accompanied Napoleon in the most  interesting portion of his marvellous history. There were figures  of Josephine in her Imperia[l] costume Prince Lucien The  King of Rome Madame Mere Napoleon's mother his  sister the wife of Murat and Queen of Naples and Napoleon  crossing the Alps. In this room Napoleon is represented 
 under four phases—as a general as the E^m^peror as the Exile and lastly  in death. One of the most famous of the Napoleonic relics is  the carriage of Napoleon in which he made the campaign of  Russia and which was captured on the eve of the battle of Waterloo  and sent with the officer who took it to the Regent of England from  whom it was purchased for 2,500. It accompanied the Emperor in  many of his campaigns and was used by him as sovereign of Elba  It was constructed so as to make good accomodations for riding sleeping  writing eating storing arms &c. I sat in this carriage in which  the great Napoleon had sat so many anxious hours and from which  he gave command in his final battle—Waterloo. There was  also the identical sword worn by him during his campaign in  Egypt and a host of other relics but probably the most curious  relic is the counterpane used on the camp-bed on which Napoleon  died, marked with his blood.    Chamber of Horrors    Full figures: Count De Lonrge as in prison in the Bastile—Marot  taken immediately after his assassination by Cha[r]lotte Corday with  a knife in his bath.

I left London on the 26th of June and rode by rail to Birmingham  One year ago on the 27th the Prophet Joseph and Hyrum the Patriarch  his brother were martyred and I appointed the 27 of June as    A Day of Prayer and Fasting    throughout all the Churches in the British Isles. I met with  the Saints that evening in Birmingham.    I remained in Birmingham several days  and then went into the Potteries Staffordshire from thence I went to  Manchester and on the 8th of July returned to Liverpool.    On the 18th of the same month my wife Phebe  gave birth to a fine son to whom I gave the name of Joseph on  the 8th day of his age when I blessed him in the arms of his mother.    I continued my Presidential labours in and around  Liverpool being most of the time in the office until August the  22nd when I took the train to Manchester and next day continued 
 to Sheffield where we held conference the next ^following^ day ^&^ returned to Liverpool three  days afterwards were ^Here^ I remained but two days and then attended the Preston Conference  held August the 31st and returned again to Liverpool on the 1st of September.    On the 6th of this month I forwarded the trunk of Elder  Lorenzo Barnes to President Young by Elder Houston who went on board of the  Oregon with a number of others of the Saints.    On the 13th with my wife and 2 children I left  Liverpool to attend    The Manchester Quarterly Conference  held Sep 14th    There were represented twenty four Branches at this time  composing the Manchester Conference with a total of one thousand seven  hundred and sixty nine members including 44 Elders 99 Priests 57 Teachers  and 27 Deacons. One hundred and fifteen had been baptized during  the quarter. Most of the Branches were represented in good standing  A recommendation was presented to Elder Holmes by the unanimous vote  of the Conference and Elder James D. Ross appointed to supply his  place for the time being as President of the Manchester Conference.    We returned to Liverpool on the 16th and receieved  letters from my wife's father and brother containing the ^news of the^ death of her mother  on the 21st of July aged 70 years 3 months and 13 days. My wife did  not return until two days afterwards. I did not inform her of the death  of her mother intending to let her recover herself from the fatigue of her  journey &c but she found the letters before I informed her and was very much  affected by the sudden blow.    Lemington Conference  was held Oct the 1st 5th.    Myself and Elder Hedlock from Liverpool attended. A good impression  was made through^out^ the conference upon the minds of a large audience  of respectable citizens notwithstanding that mobs had recently been  raised there who had broken the banisters around the stairs of our 
 meeting place with the benches tables &c.    Lemington is one of the first aristocratic towns in  England which the Nobility and gentry visit as one of their select places  and in consequence of its sulphur springs. The streets and buildings  of the town are rich and splendid in appearance.    A Visit to Warwich Castle    In company of about a dozen Saints I visited  the Warwichk castle and tower. It is considered the most splendid  castle in England and is furnished with all the magnificence which art  and the wealth of Earldom could bestow upon it.    The main body of the castle was 333 ft  long divided into its various rooms. The walls were hung with rich  gorgeous tapestry the rooms furnished with the costliest furniture  and the richest damask-covered chairs tables and stands inlaid  with pearl shell and precious stones. Some of these articles cost  £15,000 each and would take three years for the artizen to make.    This castle contained a great variety of  Paintings and portraits of Kings Queens Lords Orators Reformers  and nobles. One among the gallery of portraits was the founder of   the Jesuits.    From the windows of the castle we looked  out upon stately ceders of Lebanon oak firs and other shrubs and  saw the pleasure grounds of forty acres and a park five miles in  circumferance. This castle was 800 years old and the Tower  500 years old and 150 feet high. We went to the top of it and had a  magnificient view of all the surrounding country.    In a small room at the entrance of the  castle we had a view of the armoury of the celebrated Guy  His helmet breastplate and shield weighs 120 pounds and his   sword 20 lbs. His copper porage pot holds 120 gallons and  six grown persons of us sat in it at the same time. 
 In the evening I took the train in company with Elder  Hedlock and rode to Birmingham. On our arrival we found Elder Crook  waiting for us. We accompanied him to the Hall of the Latter-day  Saints where we found between 4 and 5 hundred of the saints sitting  at a general tea table. As we entered the door the clapping of  hands and stomping of feet that welcomed us made the room tremble  and it was with difficulty that I could get to the stand as all wished to  shake hands with me as I passed along.    After taking a repast with this warm hearted  band of brethren and sisters I addressed them for about the space of  an hour clothed with the Spirit and power of God. I was followed by  Elder Hedlock and we spent a good time together.    Next day I left Birmingham for Liverpool  On the 14th and 15th of the month in Liverpool I sat  with the board of Directors of the British and American Joint Stock  Company until near midnight of the second day. It was a hard day's  work and a critical one. Each article of the deed for settlement  preparing for regestration was read over several times changed and  altered as the Board of Directors thought fit.    It had been with much labour care and  expence to get the Joint Stock Company settled so as to begin to  do business and during the day I had many trying things to  encounter. My spirit was greived and insulted as it had been many  times since I came to Liverpool from a source that I ought  to have expected better things.    We got the Nauvoo Times and Neighbor  and New York Messenger informing us of the commencing of mobing  once more in Hancock County. The mob had burned 42 houses  of the Saints in Lima; and a day or two later the Liverpool  papers teemed with rumours that mobs were raging against  the Saints in Hancock Co. had burned severed hundred of their  houses and that a proposition had been made by the Twelve  to the citizens of Hancock County for the Mormons to leave ^that they would leave the State as soon as they could dispose of their property^ 
 Proclamation of the Twelve Apostles    [13 lines blank]    On the 24th I met with Elders Hedlock and Ward  and laid before them my feelings concerning our situation in  Liverpool both temporally and spiritually. There had not  been a good understanding between us for some time but I told  these brethren what I wished to be done and seemingly our  meeting was profitable and at the close of our consultation we  bowed our knees together before God.    Towards the latter end of the follow[ing]   month I received intelligence from President Young that  the State of Illinois would not protect the citizens of Nauvoo  and that the only terms of peace granted at all was upon condition  of our people leaving the State. The Presidency of the Church and  the community themselves had been under the necessity of agreeing  to leave the State of Illinois the next Spring. I wrote in   return to President Young expressing my feelings severely upon  this extermination of the Saints and asked his counsel whether  I should tarry in England or return to America. I also sent  him a duplicate of the entering of the copyright of the 
 Books of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants.    I also notified the Presiding Elders of the British   mission of a Special General Conference to be held at Manchester  on the 14th day of December 1845.    I then left Liverpool and attended the Glasgow  Conference held sunday October ^Novem^ the 30th and returned again to Liverpool  on the 3rd of December and on the 13th with Mrs Woodruff  I took train to Manchester.    Special General Conference  of the  British Mission  held at  The Hall of Science Manchester Dec. 14, 1845.    The conferences of the British Mission were represented  containing a total of eleven thousand and thirty two members  with one of the quorum of the Twelve 8 High Priests 392 Elders  590 Priests 311 Teachers and 188 Deacons and 1573 baptized during  the last eight months. The statistics of the Staffordshire  Conference was not included in this total.    Thus had the work of God in the British  Isles in a few years grown into a mighty mission.    This Special Conference was continued  through two days and much important business was taken up  and arrangements made in view of my return to the United States  and ^and^ the emigration expulsion of the Saints and the general affairs of  the mission discoursed upon.    I spent the day following the Conference  with the Saints an Manchester and bid them farewell and  next day returned to Liverpool. 
 St John's Market Liverpool on Christmas Eve    My wife and I paid it a visit. It was a fine  sight. The best of beef mutton pork veal and prize bullocks sheep  lambs &c uncut filled their department of the Market House game  and poultry of every kind crouded its department and fruit from  almost every country and clime was heaped fancifully on its  numerous decorated stalls and the whole body of the market was  hung with evergreen. After we had viewed St John's Market  we returned home and at eleven o'clock at night we attended    High Mass In the Catholic Chapel  Scotland Road Liverpool.    This was the first time in my life that I had ever attended  High Mass in a Catholic Church.    I and my wife eat our Christmas dinner  at brother and sister Enion's with whom our daughter Susan  Cornelia had been for some time living and in the afternoon we  all attended a general tea meeting of the Saints held at the Music  Hall in Liverpool with a company of 3 or 4 hundred Saints.    A few more days past and the year  1845 had rolled round and I and my family ^in^ Liverpool continuing  my second mission to the British Isles.    My Synopsis of Labours and Travels     In Great Brittain   in 1845    I travelled in the British Isles three thousand  six hundred and eighty two miles.

 Written on the Death of Calvin  Foss by W. Woodruff. 1837    [upside-down text] Death of Calvin Foss 
 [top of page blank]    On New Years day I wrote Elder Samuel Downs  a letter and sent him as a New Year's Gift some hair from the  heads of Joseph Smith the Prophet and all the male members of  his father's ^the Smith^ family and also some of the hair of Joseph's mother and  most of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles with a piece of  the Prophet's handkerchief.    On the 3rd I left Liverpool for   Preston and preached on the Sunday.    [3 lines blank]    The glasgow Conference sent me elveven  pounds three shillings and the Manchester Conference 42   pounds and Birmingham six pounds to assist me and my  family to return to America. I gave out of this 12 pounds  to Elder Clark    On the evening of the 10th I made  a feast for a few of the brethren before my departure 
 and had for my guests Elders Hedlock Ward Clark Wilson and Downes.    Next day was Sunday and the last but one  of my stay in England on this mission. I communed with the Saints  and delivered in the evening my farewell address.    The following week was a very busy one  in preparing for our own emigration and the sending off of a small  company of the Saints.    On the 16th I went on board of the Ship  Liverpool with my family and about 40 others of the Saints. Elders  Hedlock Fielding McChacie and myself ^I and^ went out with the ship ten  miles and I then parted with my family and the company of Saints  on board and returned with the above ^several^ brethren in a small boat to  Liverpool for I could not go for some days but had to leave my  wife and children to cross the Atlantic without me and tarry  myself for some days to settle my business and the affairs of the  mission.    As the 21st was the last day of my time  on shore I was determined to make some settlement of my affairs  before going on board of the ship and this I had found hard to  accomplish. Elders Ward and Hedlock had so much business of  their own to do that they had done but little to help me in the  settlement of mine and what they should have done had been  put off by them to the last minute. This made it very hard   for me. I had to pull along alone and none to help and Elder  Ward especially had manifested great indifference and neglect towards  me. However I struggled through it by the help of God and   also overthrew a design to partly rob me of the little means I had  This design I had every reason to believe was concockted by Mr  James the Printer and a professed friend standing near me in   office and interest.    But I succeeded this day in effecting a final  settlement and the statement showed that I left the printing   department of the Church with property in excess of debts

 the people it was the last meeting I should hold   with them for a season, it created much excitement.   I had appointments out for a week, which I got Bro.   Cordon to fill. I went before the Lord in prayer and   asked him where I should go, the Spirit said, go to the   south. According to the directions of the Spirit, on the   3rd March I went to Herefordshire, and called upon  John Benbow at Castlefroom; here I found a people   prepared for the Gospel. I preached twice at his house.   On the 6th I baptized 6 persons including John Benbow   and wife. I here found a society called "United   Brethren," numbering about six hundred members,   and about 50 preachers, Thos. Kington was the presiding Elder;   they came from all quarters to hear me preach and   believed my testimony and I preached and baptized   daily; the Ministers of the Church of England sent three   church clerks to see what I was doing and I baptized   them. One constable came to arrest me for preaching, and   I baptized him. In about 30 days days I baptized 160,   forty eight of which ^whom^ were preachers of the United   Brethren including their presiding Elder, Thomas   Kington.      I established forty two preaching places licensed   according to law.      On the 9th April I had an appointment at Haw  Cross, as I was going into the meeting, letters were put   into my hands from Elder Brigham Young and others   informing me of his arrival with five of the Twelve,  and requested me to come to Preston, and attend a   general conference,— a vast assembly had gathered at  to attend my meeting, the house, yard and street   wasere crowded, a mob had also gathered; I preached   to the people, five came forward and wished to be baptized     
 the mob surrounded the pool, armed with stones, I   dismissed the meeting and went away, but the congregation   and mob remained on the ground till midnight, and   as there was no prospect of their dispersing and the candidates   were anxious to be baptized, I went down in to the water   and baptized five in the mist of a shower of stones,  the water was all in a foam for a rod around me,  none that I baptized were hit, and I was only hit   twice, once on my hip and once on my head, the one ^blow^ on   my head raised a large bump, it which went away while  I was confirming: S^s^ubsequently I baptized many of the mob.      Subsequently I left next morning for Preston and attended   the conference with the Twelve, and returned to Hereforshire  accompanied by Elder Brigham Young, on the 22nd April,   and was soon joined by Elder Willard Richards. Elder   Young remained with me twenty seven days, preaching,  baptizing, confirming and counciling; numbers were added   daily to the church: he then returned to Manchester.      I spent about seven months in Herefordshire,   Glo^uce^stershire and Worcestershire, we baptized over   eighteen hundred including all of the United Brethren   save one: we baptized over two hundred preachers   of various denominations in that part of the vinyard      [line through remainder of page] 
 A synod of church ministers became so alarmed for their   flocks in that part of the vineyard, they petitioned parliament   to adopt some measures to stop our preaching, they got ^received^ for   an answer, that if they were as well acquainted with the   Bible as their hunting grounds, and were as much interested   in the welfare of the souls of men, as the chasing of the   stags and foxes, they would not loose so many of their congregations.      Aug. 18th, I visited London in company with Elders H.  C. Kimball and G. A. Smith, I labored with them in establish-  ing a church, spending over 5 months in that populous city.      We visited nearly every part of the city, and all the   notable places that we could have access to.      I attended all the general conferences in England,  and set sail with my brethren of the Twelve on the ship, Rochester   April 20, 1841— arrived in New York May 20,.      I went to Scarborough, Maine, got ^after^ my wife, and also ^also^   my son, Wilford, whom I had not before seen, he was born   March 22, 1840. My daughter Sarah Emma had died July 17, 1840.      I returned to New York and started for Nauvoo,   via the Lakes, was wrecked on Lake Michigan in the steamer   Chesapeake, but arrived in Nauvoo in safety Oct. 6 1841, when   I had the happy privilege of meeting with the Prophets Joseph   and Hyrum, and my brethren of the Twelve.      I bought a log house of brother Tracy, on Lot No 1,  Block 106, on Hotchkiss and Durffee Streets, Prest Joseph Smith   afterward,s gave me the Lot.      I spent ^the^ winter of 1841–2, attending meetings   councils and laboring with my hands, I attended the   Nauvoo House provision Store until the 3rd Feby. 1842,  when I take took charge of the ^business department of the^ printing office in  connection with Elder John Taylor.      On the 5th of March, [blank] ^my Daughter, Phebe, Amelia, was born.      Sept 24th The Printing office took fire in the upper   story in the midst of a large amount of paper, and it  came near burning up. was with difficulty extinguished.     
 X' July 5, 1848, (while on a mission to the Eastern States)  I drove my carriage, containing myself and family into the door yard of  bro. James Williams in Iowa, to camp for the night; I tied my mules to a  large oak tree several rods from the carriage; as we were about to lay down  in the carriage for the night, I was strongly impressed to go and move my  mules from the oak tree, and also to move my carriage; I followed the  dictates of the Spirit, and removed my mules to a small hickory grove,  also moved my carriage several rods, and retired to rest.      In a short time a heavy rain storm came on, which broke  the tree near the ground, and laid it prostrate where my carriage had stood,  as it was, the top struck the hind end of the carriage; the tree was  2 feet in diameter; thus, by obeying the whisperings of the spirit, myself  and family were preserved.

On the 23rd of July 1842 President Joseph Smith sent me from  Nauvoo to St Louis to procure a stock of paper. I started went down upon  a steamer to steemboat was 6 days on the way during which time I  was severely attak with the Billious fever on the day I made my  purchase the fever was so high I was sccarcely sensible of what I was  doing as soon as I had made my purchase & got my freight on  board I took my birth and lay there untill I arived in Nauvoo  which was on the 10th Aug I was confined to my bed 40 days  and passed through the most sever[e] fit of sickness I ever endured  my life was dispaired of by many 
 (*2nd, Page 6th paper apart)    On the 5 day of Oct 1846 while with the Camp of Israel  building up Winter Quarter on the west side of the Missouri  River then Indian Country I passsed passed through one of the most  painful scenes of my life and serious misfortune of any of my life  I took my ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the bluffs to cut some shingle  timber to cover my cabin I was acompanied by two other men and  while falling the third tree ^which was an oak over two feet in diameter^ I steped backed of it some 8 feet and also one  side about the same distance where I thought I was entirely out of danger  but when the tree fell (being over two feet in diameter) ther being a crook  in the body of it, it struck a knowl on the ground and the whole body of the tree  shot end ways back of the stump and bounded & the but of the tree struck  me in the breast and knocked me several in the air against a standing  Oak and the falling tree followed me in its bend and caught me  against the standing tree and I came down between ^the two trees^ them one  standing & the other falling but before reaching the ground I was  liberated from between them and struck the ground upon my feet.  It badly bruised my left thigh the whole leangth of it and my hip  also my left arm it also broak my breast bone into also 3 ribs  on my left side it also bruised my lungs, vitals, and left side in  a shocking manor. After the accident I sat upon a log untill  Mr John Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horse. Notwith-  standing I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ride  2 1/2 miles over a very rough road and had to dismout twice in  consequence of miry places, my breast and vitals was so badly torn  to peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an arrow  I continued on horsback untill I arived at Turky Creek on the  North side of Winter Quarters I then became exhausted & was taken  off and carried in a chair to my waggon not having a ^my^ cabin built  I was met in the street by president Brigham Young H. C Kimball, W  Richards & others who assisted in carrying me to my family. Before lying  me upon my bed the presidency laid hands upon me rebuked my suffering  & distress in the name of the Lord and said I should live and  not die. I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon and as  the Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live and  not die. I employed no physician on this occasion but was administered 
 to by the Elders of Israel and nursed by my wife I lay upon  my bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to nit  together which commenced on the 9th day I began to walk about in  20 days from the time I was hurt and in 30 days from the time I was  hurt I again commenced hard labour. And It has always  appeared miraculous to me that with all the injuries and broken bones  that I have had, I have not a lame limb about me but have  been enabled ever since to endure the hardest manual labor,  exposure, hardships and injuries have even walked 40, 50 & on one occasion  60 miles in a day. However if I over labor or take a severe cold I  feel it more sensibly in my breast and left side than I did  before my last injury.  Thus I have occupied considerable space in  referring to those peculiar circumstances which here attending me ^thus far^ during life  and to sum the matter up it stands about thus. I have broaken  both legs (one twice in two) both arms, both ancles, my breast bone,  3 ribs, have been drowned, froze, & scalded. have been in two  water wheels under a full head of water, bitten by a mad dog  and passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes. Yet the  mercies of God have been over me, and my life has thus far  been preseved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to render  the gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my Heavenly  Father praying that the remainder of my days, may be spent  in his service & the building up of his Kingdom    (Page 9th * History) Having embraced the fullness of the Everlasting Gospel of  Jesus Christ and seeing in it great beauty, power, glory & salvation  I had a great ^great^ desire to teach it to my ^the gospel fellow men, and this  desire increased upon me and rested with great wait upon my  mind but ^which^ I did not reveal this to any man ^person^. But one Sunday  evening I retired into the woods alone by myself and called upon  the Lord in earnest prayer to open my way to go and preach  the gospel of Salvation to the children of men ^inhabitants of the Earth^. The Spirit of the  Lord rested upon me & bore witness unto me that my prayer was  heard & should be answered upon my head. I arose from my  knees happy & walked some forty rods through a thick wood into  an open road, as I entered the road there stood before me  Judge Elias Higby an High Priest with whom I had been 
 closely associated having ^and^ lived in the same house for a number  of months but had never to my recollection said any thing to me  about preaching or ordination. But now as I approached him  he said Brother Wilford the Spirit of the Lord tells me that you  should be ordained & go and preach the gospel ^on a mission^. I said very well  if it is the will of the Lord I am ready.    At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights Clay County Missouri  on the 5th day of Nov 1834 I was ordained to the office of a priest by the  directions of the High Council under the hands of Brother Simeon Carter  Stephen Winchester & Heman Hyde were ordained priests at the same time.    I called upon Bishop Edward Partridge and asked him what my  mission should be in what part of the country I should go to preach  the gospel. He replyed that I should ^Bishop Partridge said he would^ like to have some of the Brethren ^me^ go into  the Southern States through Arkansas Tennesee Kentucky &c if I could find  any body who had faith enough to go ^with me^ for it would be a hard mission  and a hard ^dangerous^ county to travel in at present in consequence of the Missouri  persecutions. I told him I was as ready to go South as any where else if he  wished it. As Arkansas lay South of Missouri I asked him if I  should go through Jackson County as it lay direct in our path ^route^ he said  it would be at the risk of ones life & I have not got faith enough to  undertake it if you have you can try it, I asked him if I went  through Jackson County if I should start without purse or scrip as in  general terms that seemed ^according^ to be the law ^of God^. He said that he had not got  faith enough to start on a mission through Jackson County without money  and if I dare it I must do it on my own faith. As the commandments  required the Elders to go out without purs or scrip I felt strenous to keep  the commandments so I ^started without money^ resolved that to go without purse or scrip   I wished to have some companion go with my ^up^ on my mission I did  not wish to launch forth into the open world alone. I called upon  Elder Harry Brown (who had accompanied me from Richland New York to Clay Co  Missouri) and asked him if he would not accompany me it met his  wishes and Bishop Partridge gave him his mission with me. And  we immediately ^prepared^ ourselves to start upon our journey And on the 13th day of Jan  1835 I recieved the following recommend in connexion with my priests license  ((Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, Jan 13 1835 This certifies that Wilford Woodruff  has faithfully discharged evry duty required of him in the Camp of the Saints  on the 13 day Jan 1835 I received an honorable discharge from Lyman Wight from  the duties of Zions Camp and

 from you yesterday, I have no hesitancy in expressing   my firm belief that I can get a subscription of $200,000   in sixty days and not more than one quarter to one   third of this amount would be outside capital. For   the balance of the money needed bonds can be issued   secured by the money already spent and at 5 or 6%   interest for 10 years.    I am very much grieved to see that the brethren give   no credit to one who having the courage of his convictions   spends time & money in experimenting and developing, they   seem to make no distinction between that and endeavoring   to inaugorate or establish and run a developed business    A kindly word ^from you^ showing the palpable distrinction would   do me much good.

 Salt Lake City: March 10, 1888.    Prest Woodruff and Brethren of the Presidency.    Dear Brethren:    The difficulties which now beset the   inauguration of the business I represent vary very considera-  bly from the physical difficulties which have been met and   overcome, and for help have come them I now earnestly appeal  to you. I readily recognize, and I feel keenly, the difference in   the circumstances of the true friends of the people before and   after the commencement of the "Grand Steal". Heretofore  the establishment of an industrial enterprise for the benefit of   our people has been much more easily reached than it can  possibly be at the present time, because, with the will the  people's best friends had the means to assist with the  lubricating element of money as well as influence and friendship.  Now money is out of the question but influence and friendship  and the power to use them remain.    The element which has brought about this important change  has dammed up the source and turned the channels and cur-  rents of fertilizing means from where they could be used for prac-  tical benefits, into courses barren of good results, and have these  partially paralysed the hand of material assistance, and now to   keep as much as possible absolute control out of the hands of  iminical and paralysing power seems to be the great desideratum;  to do this I appeal to you for your help and counsel. 
 There is no longer question with regard to the profitableness of the busi-  ness I represent; the profits, to say the least of them, will be very  considerable from the beginning and the business properly managed  will assume magnificent proportions, and in a few years those who  control it will be in the front ranks of our finiancial world. Wise  manipulation, prudent counsel, and competent assistance right  now will in all probability secure this control. He who feels interested  for the welfare of this people would feel very much chagrined, to have  levied upon them, when employed profitably & remuneratively in this business,  a monthly tribute for the support of the "loyal league" or to see them  superseded by Chinamen, or worse the lowlived tramps and apostates  who are enlisted in the Devil's forces, or to have this magnificent  financial power wielded for the crushing out of the last vestige of   freedom and liberty left to us. God has not only prepared and  preserved but he has given to us this country; He has blessed the   soil, increased the water, made the elements conducive to fertility,  withheld the frost, advanced the seasons, and made this portion of his  creation ^beautiful and enviable, and^, at our solicitation and to gratify our pleasure, and to make our  homes pleasant and desirable He has given us the wisdom and the   energy to develop the resources of our mountain land. Shall we   easily and without consideration and effort allow any portion of the   control of these choice blessings to pass out of our possession?    The business I represent grapples with the outspending of one  and a half millions a year; it means the employment of over  a thousand hands, and the manipulation of the vast wealth  that will inevitably accumulate around this nucleus. Shall  our people control this and have the power to employ God's people 
 Salt Lake City Mar 13 [18]90    P[r]esidents Woodruff Cannon & Smith    Dear Brethren    I have the honor of  informing you that the Sugar County bill   passed & the Governor signed it at   10 last Evening.    It was handicapped  with iron, ironpipe & rope & twine, but   it was passed by heavy majority in both   houses.

 friends to do this work or shall our unfriends control it and infuse  an element into it that will build up the opposingte Kingdom?    The kindly assistance of your consideration, counsel and influence  will secure this control; by your active advice and friendship for  this enterprise, the Cooperative stores and brethren who have  money and lack only a little inspiriting influence to give them  the fortitude to embark some of their means in so worthy and   profitable an enterprise, a preponderance at least of mormon  capital can be secured. It is probably neither desirable nor possi-  ble to entirely exclude outside capital but to keep it in the minority   is the object to be attained, and to hold the reins of power now is  the time for consideration and forethought and to plan to retain that  which will be a great blessing to keep and it appears to me   would be a misfortune, if not actually a sin, on our part, to lose.    Your kind sympathy with the enterprise, your desire for its  success, your counsel concerning the course to pursue, and   general fostering interest for ^in^ its development, will be invalua-  ble factors in its prosperity and securing its control, and are   most earnestly and respectfully solicited.    Very respectfully   Your brother  Arthur Stayner.

 Salt Lake City, Utah;  June 15th 1889.    Presidents Woodruff, Cannon & Smith:    Dear Brethren:    Permit me to respectfully lay before you the following reflec-  tions upon the result of my interview yesterday:  It is now nearly  nine years since I first conceived the idea of building up the Sugar  industry in Utah.  Faithfully, ploddingly and patiently I have centralized  my efforts upon that one object and have allowed nothing to stand in  the way of its accomplishment.  No sacrifice has been too great, no jeopardy  too venturesome, no reasonable consideration too precious to reach the desired  end.  Everything I possessed or could control, savings, earnings, credit,  comfort, pleasure, home itself have been placed upon the altar and  immolated like Palissy's furniture to reach the blessing proposed.  If  I had failed and wasted my time and labor on an unprofitable under-  taking fruitless of profitable result I would be willing to accept the reward of  a fool should have, but with all the benefits, social, political and financial  which belong to the business I have labored in plainly in sight, I may be  forgiven if my heart is heavy with disappointment at the result of the interview  yesterday.  Let the intense interest I feel in this matter plead excuse for me  in asking respectfully this question; Are there not some means of reaching a subscrip-  tion of $3000 -- being $1000 each & paying 10% thereof, to manifest for this enterprise  a recognition by the Presidency of this.

Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother:    Very respectfully I submit the following:    I have the opportunity of purchasing certain lands  on the Provo Bench, (the point which I have selected as the  most suitable to establish the first plantation and factory  for sugar) surrounding, or contiguous to, two sections of   University lands, costing something less than $15000$—  an average of $1700 per acre; also of purchasing for $10,000  the water right of the Provo Woollen Mills, sufficient to   irrigate 5000 acres. By purchasing this land I can  secure the two sections of University land. An Eastern  party is trying to secure these very lands in order  to introduce a colony of strangers upon that very section  of country.    With a little help from you I can secure  this location. The brethren who have promised  money on the Sugar industry will [keep] their promises 
 if they can see that you are willing to sustain the  enterprise, And sufficient money will be forthcoming  to carry the business successfully on if I can get the  first step taken aright.    You have assisted banking, merchandising, and   wagon setting firms with your potential influence, and   the principle of production modestly asks for your sanction  and support. Respectfully I urge that the Sugar industry  is second to none in importance, in profit, in practicability,  in power and in influence. In 6 years after commencement  it will empty 1000 hands, and its output of production  be ($1000,000$) a million dollars annually. It will employ  10,000 acres of land and 10 factories. If we are to stay  here, is this not a matter of importance to secure? Will  it not be a cement under our feet,? will it not fasten  the hearts and interests of people here, establish firmly their  homes and if we secure the control will not the people  employed be friends and not enemies?    A small subscription from you with the moral support  of the name of some of the leading brethren on the Directory  will secure these things.    It is now too late to plant for this season, but there  is yet time to secure the land and water in question  and the prospective benefits of the magnificent industry.

Cannon    Dear Brethren:    The locating committee of the Utah Sugar   Company (Morris, Armstrong, Howe, Thatcher, Hardy   & Stayner & Dinwoodey) respectfully request the   privilege of an interview with you, and if agreeable   to you whether or not tomorrow (Wednesday)   afternoon at such hour as you many name)  will be convenient to you    Very respectfully, in behalf of the Committee  Arthur Stayner.    P. S. I await your reply per Brohand Bro Sudbury    A Stayner    3 pm Wednesdy  Nov 320 [18]89 
 I assure you in the most solemn manner that the  business will be a success, unless Providence passes  a special act against it. If we do not do it some-  body else will just as the Provo bench and university  lands will be secured by strangers if we do not secure it  right now.    Your sanction and approval and influence with  a few thousand dollars will do this. I find that those  who promised support hang on your action to a great extent,  and much difficulty will arise, and consequent delay  if your favorable action is delayed, but if you grant  it every thing is planned and ready for immediate  action. We can plow up the land ready for next year,  build the houses and stables, plant lucern fields, make  the water ditches and secure the success of the undertaking,  all with about $30,000$ which I know I can get as fast   as I want it. I am offered one quarter section of   the land and three thousand dollars worth of teams or stock  just as soon as I get started. 
 With these interests at stake and consequent anxiety I   feel that you will excuse my apparent importunity, which   may have appeared unseemly. The first year's profits of   $40,000 have passed away, it is too late now to think of them,  but mby moving now what I have stated can be secured.    The party intending or trying to purchase the Provo Bench  has gone to Colorado & will return next week, he says with  the money, therefore I respectfully ask your early   and favorable action hereon.    Very respectfully  Your brother in the Gospel  Arthur Stayner 
 great people? The President of the Church subscribes $1000  to build a mill in Idaho, benefitting a few score of settlers there,  cannot he also subscribe $1000, and each of his Counsellors subscribe  $1000, paying 10% thereof, to build up this great industry for  the whole people in Utah? It is too much, I am  aware, to ask of you personally, not being capitalists, but in  a matter of ^such^ general benefit and importance is it unrea-  sonable that out of means under your control so small  an amount as $300 might be obtained to give the tone  of recognition and confidence to so worthy an undertaking?  I have secured many good friends to the industry  who are ready to show their confidence by their payments,  but it is me that some of the men who have become rich here  and claim to be financiers have not as yet yielded  their tangible sympathy and interest to the enterprise. They   claim, by virtue of their success no matter by what methods   produced, the right to stand aloof and look supercili-  ously down, from their supposed point of vantage, upon the  labours and propositions of other men and they claim the  right of judging other men's capabilities by standards  of their own raising, and I have proved that they are  not above the abject meanness of wresting from a temporarily  exhausted workesr the benefit of his labour and using the develop-  ment which is the result of his exertion without due and proper

 Salt Lake City: March 10, 1888.    Prest. Woodruff and Brethren of the Presidency.    Dear Brethren:  The diffiiculties which now beset the   inauguration of the business I represent vary very considera-  bly from the physical difficulties which have been met and  overcome, and for help to overcome them I now earnestly appeal  to you. I readily recognize, and I feel keenly, the difference in  the circumstances of the true friends of the people before and  after the commencement of the "Grand Steal". Heretofore  the establishment of an industrial enterprise for the benefit of  our people has been much more easily reached than it can  possibly be at the present time, because, with the will the  people's best friends had the means to assist with the  lubricating element of money as well as influence and friendship.  Now money is out of the question but influence and friendship  and the power to use them remain.    The elemebt which has brough about this important change  has dammed up the sourse and turned the channels and cur-  rents of fertilizing means from where they could be used for prac-  tical benefits, into courses barren of good results, and have thus  partially paralysed the hand of material assistance, and now to  keep as much as possible absolute control out of the hads of  inimical and paralysing power secues to be the great desideratiun;  to do this I appeal to you for your help and counsel.

One of these branches is the producing and man-  ufacturing, the other one is the trading and speculative.  A very little experience and reflection will enable one to de-  termine the relative qualifications requisite for the represen-  tatives of the two branc[h]es. While each should possess energy  and vim, and be thoroughly imbued with the spirit of  his work, the one may be of slower thought and tempera-  ment than the other but must possess that dogged per-  severance and invincible pertinacity of purpose that knows  no surrender; he must also possess to a marked degree  the virtue of patience which will enable him to watch the  slow developing of experiment and which, if he does not  reach success at one trial, will inspire him to look forward 
 payment therefor, and they presume to set up their indepen-  dent ladders on the platforms he has raised in order to pluck  the fruit which he has planted, when it ripens. They presume  to interpret my temporarily exhausted condition into ^lack of^ capacity  because they do not comprehend the self devotion which  inspires one to spend his last dollar and jeopardise his  every interest to produce other than the most selfish  results. There is no more justice in this course than in the  attitude of the United States in robbing this people of their  property, and I appeal to the highest authority God has on  the Earth for protection against the possibility of anything   like such an outrage.    The words of one of the brethren addressed to Bro Morris and   myself a few weeks ago are ringing in my ears because  they so truly re-echo the sentiments of my heart, "Is it  possible that we cannot do anything for the benefit  of the people without the Bank corner"? My sympathy  with this sentiment has rendered me somewhat indifferent  about courting their influence. While I do not desire  to antagonize them I am not willing to bow, just because  they have got money, to men who have no higher concep-  tion of a business than the sordid consideration of how  much money there is in it for themselves.    It is a generally received axiom that to appreciate the 
 beauty and sublinity of poetry is the very next akin to being  the poet who produces them, so it may well be said that to  appreciate the labours of self sacrifice is to be the possessor  of the self devotion necessary to its accomplishment. Upon  hearts unable to appreciate, the devoted labours of a lifetime  fall as down upon adamant, and the recognition of such  a life, be it rewarded or unrequited, depends upon the  honor and sensitiveness of the community who are the  beneficiaries of the work.    I appeal to you, brethren, for further, and I trust more  favorable, consideration for I lay this matter at your  feet as the servants of God nearest to Him, and I  [illegible] ^hesitate^ to take it up again unless blessed and imbued  with your respect and influence.    Very respectfully submitted  by your brother in the Gospel  Arthur Stayner    P.S. Permit me to add that I come before you,  as the Gospel goes to the world, without the fictitious  aid of wealth and wordly influence, but trusting  in your inspirations to receive me and your  generous sympathy to recognize my position    AStayner

 of these two powerful elements it diffuses benefits to the  many while its kindred branch benefits only the few. An  illustration of this principle is seen by analyzing and  comparing Z.C.M.I., one of the noblest & praiseworthy institutions  of the trading branch, with some of the manufacturing estab-  lishments in our community.    ZCMI with a capital of one million dollars sells  3¼ million of goods a year; of this amount there is kept  here for circulation $200,000 wfor wages, $100,000 for dividend  and probably $50,000 more for reserve fund, in all say  $350,000, the remainder, nearly three millions, is shovelled  out of the Territory just as fast and as completely as it can  possibly be done; this money goes to pay operatives 2000  or 3000 miles away for doing things, many of which some  of our unemployed people, if properly organized, could,  & would be glad to, do; and with this capital this Institution  employs only one hand to each $8000, pays out wages  equal to only 20% and earns including reserve fund  15%, while the shoeshop and tannery occupying  only one eighth as much capital, saves for circulation  one half as much money, pays out for wages an  amount equal to 50% of its capital and employs two  hands to the $1000 or sixteen times as many hands  as ZCMI does to the same amount of capital; yet 
 There is no longer question with regard to the profitableness of the busi-  ness I represent; the profit, to say the least of them, will be very  considerable from the beginning and the business properly managed  will assure magnificent proportions, and in a few years those who  control it will bei n the front ranks of our financial world. []  manipulation, prudent counsel, and competent assistance right  now will in all probability secure this control. He who feels interested  for the welfare of this people would feel very much chagrined, to have  levied upon them, when employed profitably & remuneratively in this business,  a monthly tribute for the support of the "loyal league" or to see them  superseded by Chinamen, or worse the [loralived] tramps and apostates  who are enlisted in the Devil's forces, or to have this magnificent  financial power wielded for the crushing out of the last vestige of  freedom and liberty left to us. God has not only prepared and  preserved but he has given to us this country; He has blessed the  soil, increased the water, made the elements conducive to fertility,  withheld the frost, advanced the seasons, and made this portion of his  creation ^beautiful and enviable, and^, at our solicitation and to gratify our pleasure and to make our  homes pleasant and desirable He has given us the wisdom and the  energy to develop the resources of our mountain alnd. Shall we  easily and without consideration and effort allow any portion of the  control of these choice blessings to pass out of our possession.?    The business I represent grapples with the outspending of one  and a half millions a year; it means the employment if over  a thousand hands, and the manipulation of the vast wealth  that will inevitably accumulate around this nucleus. Shall   our people control this and have the power to employ God's people

 this shoeshop is capable of supplying this people only  one pair of shoes each every sixteen months, thus showing  ample room for four or five more factories of like capacity.  Thus it can be seen that ZCMI, with its one manufacturing  offspring occupying only one eighth of its capital, is doing  nearly as much good to the community as it is doing  with the other seven eighths in the mercantile department,  and it is a matter worthy of notice and germain to my  argument that this one issue together with a small branch  for making overalls and jumpers is the only manufacturing  development ^of Z.C.M.I^ in twenty years of its existence, and it can  be safely averred that it would not now exist but for the  intelligent perseverance of Wm H. Lowe. I mention this  and call particular attention to it to show that the  class of men necessary to manage successfully a  mercantile institution like ZCMI, cannot be expected  to evolve from the crude elements the productions upon   which depend the employment of labour and the  true prosperity and tangible wealth of the people.    A striking illustration of the principle I wish to substantiate  is found in the incorporation of the Utah Commercial Bank  last week. Capital to the amount of $200,000 was subscribed  at short notice for this undertaking, but what benefit will  it be to the people? That $200,000 will employ not to exceed 
 friends' to do this work or shall our unfriends control it and infuse  an element into it that will build up the oppositey kingdom.?    The kindly assistance of your consideration, counsel, and influence   will secure this control; by your active advice and friendship for  this enterprise, the Cooperative stores and brethren who have  money and lack only a little inspiritng influence to give them  the fortitude to embark some of their means in so worthy and  profitably and enterprise, a preponderance at least of mormon  capital can be secured. It is probably neither desirable nor possi-  ble to entirely exclude outside capital but to keep it in the minority  is the object to be attained, and to hold the reins of power now is  the time for consideration and forethought and to plan to retain that  which will be a great blessing to keep and it appears to me  would be a misfortune, if not actually a sin on our part, to lose.    Your kind sympathy with the enterprise, your desire for its  success, your counsel concerning the course to pursue, and  general fostering interest for^in^ its development, will be invalua-  ble factors in its prosperity and securing its control, and are  most earnestly and respectfully solicited.    Very respectfully  Your brother    Arthur Stayner. 
 five or six persons or one hand to $35000 or $40000, which  means that the shoe shop industry will employ 70 to 80  times as many hands as this Bank will to the same amount  of Capital, and is it not a reasonable surmise that while  the spirit of Banking and kindred speculations prevails there  will be plenty of money to advance the interests of the few,  yetbut it looks as though the Devil may have the many. That  banks are, as animated safes, necessary and convenient insti-  tutions is conceded but from what source do they make  their money? They produce nothing, they manufacture  nothing, but they simply take their profits from other people's  earnings, by lending A's money to B and keeping the interest  that B pays for the use of it.    It is indispensable that such institutions as ZcmI and  some other kindred financial concerns should exist, and  that they are represented and manipulated by men of noble  probity and marked intelligence is a source of congratulation  to the community, but that they exist in so notable a prepon-  derance over the producing and manufacturing branch of the  financial power is a palpable evidence of faulty  utilization of the principles of political and domestic economy.    There can exist no reasonable doubt in the mind of any  statesman, having the true interests of his people in view,  that there is great superiority in the beneficent policy of

 legislating and planning for the benefit of the many, while  preserving and protecting the rights of the few.    A clearcut and palpable evidence substantiating  the proposition I have laid down with regard to the difference  of talent and qualification necessary for the two separate branches  is found in the statement made by one of the committeemen  to whom had been entrusted investigation into the merits  of the sugar industry, when he said "I cannot grasp the  details of a producing or manufacturing business but if  you will make your sugar I will buy it & sell it." This  expression showing the absence of interest in or comprehension  of anything pertaining to the producing interests seemed  to voice the sentiments of the whole committee and gave  tone to their report which recommended a disastrous  delay, whereas a few drops of the vivifying elixir, without  which production & manufacture would ever be a failure,  would have inspired a searching inquiry, elicited attract-  ive information, and engendered an interest that would  have culminated in a thorough investigation and given  us the fruition of the enterprise some time earlier.    How true it is that the safe conservatisue that declines  to move lest it fail is the dry-rot of life.    It certainly should be readily conceded that one of  the most valuable aids to the solid and tangible pros-

 OFFICE OF  THE UTAH SUGAR CO.,  P.O. BOX 499.  Secretary's Department.    Salt Lake City, Utah, Oct 26, 1889    Presidents Woodruff, Cannon & Smith    Dear Brethren:    The Committee appointed by the Sugar Company  have returned after having visited both West & East.    The digest of their report is briefly as follows:  The beetsugar Factory Alvarado Cal. cost $190,000 makes sugar 3 9/10 & per lb profit 25%  [The beetsugar Factory] Watsonville [Cal.]  $475,000 [makes sugar] 4 1/8 [per lb profit] 19%  [The] Sorghum [sugar Factory] Fortscott Kansas    $72,000 [makes sugar] 5 1/2 [per lb profit] nothing    We found the California Factories running on very rich  beets, the result of drouth being small crop but rich in sugar.  We found the Fort Scott Factory running on very poor cane  the result of a cold, wet, backward spring which caused replan[t]-  ing and immature cane.  They are making a smaller  output this year than I used to make with my old milling   and open process, and only little more than one half   of what they got last year for the whole season's average.    Consequently as the beet manufacture is so much of a   success, and the results elicited at our late Fair are so  satisfactory with regard to the saccharine in our beets,  it is not worth while to argue for the Sorghume although  it can be plainly shown that the conditions, climate,  market, and protection by freight are so much more 
 perity of a community is the motive that inspires one not  only to run some risk but to be willing to make some  sacrifice for the development of the crude resources of the  country, and the evolution of industries in which great  prospective good lies dormant. In the introduction  of all new producing and manufacturing enterprises,  no matter how skilfully managed nor what prestige  they may bear upon their front, there is a feature of  adventure or apparent risk which calls for nerve and  good judgment and staying qualities born of determined  motive. Between the inception and the consummation  of any enterprise designed for the transformation of the  crude elements into the practical and material necessaries  and comforts of life, there exists a hiatus, in the bridging  of which many a valuable and well-intentioned design  dies the death of inanition, so many there are who use  just enough fuel to make the water hot but withhold  the last few bushels of coal necessary to raise the steam  to a working pressure. The "one more day" for which  Columbus contended with his ignorant and mutinous  crew was the most valuable of all his days, for it  prevented the loss of his entire undertaking and gave  to the world the fulfilment of the Almighty's purpose, and  without that one day all his previous years of toil were a

I am however crippled through lack of means, but   make bold to ask you if you would feel disposed   to let me have $1000$ as an advance of your subscrip-  tion to be accounted for out of the first appropriation   made to me from the Company from whom I have   not as yet received a dollar.    I think it necessary to send one or two of my sons   to Europe to work in the field during the remainder of   the growing season & to work three or four months in   the Factories. It would be wise I think to send 6 or   8 of our young men to do this, so that we can have   ready competent help to assist the skilled labour we   must import.    Your Kind and favorable consideration of the foregoing   will be appreciated as a very timely assistance    Very respectfully, Arthur Stayner.

But  I am satisfied with the showing of the beet question, and  am assured by experts that our beets although they may  contain an excess of inimicable properties, they are of the same  kinds as are found in the beets of other countries and need  only a little severed treatment of the same nature as that  used in other countries.    Foreseeing them that the business will meet with  favor here, and already knowing that your sentiments  are anxious to indorse whatever is proved to be practicable  and reasonably assured of profitable success, I am very  anxious to have every measure adopted that will assist  in making the enterprise firmly founded.  In this view  I, recognizing the value of Bro Howes' judgment and skill  in Machinery, asked him if he would be willing to accom-  pany me to Europe for the purpose of visting some of  the latest improved Factories & machinery with the view to  select that best suited to our conditions and to procure  working drawings there of and either procure the same  in whole or in part in Europe or place an order with  American Manufacturers;  Bro Howe replied, as he 
 failure.    The industry which it is my earnest desire to  inaugurate amongst this people possesses all the salient points  of a successful and attractive home industry, and the  slowness of its development is not due to its inherent  weakness but to the fact that the recognition of its merits  has been submitted to men belonging to the trading and  speculative branch whose indifferent and hypercritical  gaze, lacking the warmth of sympathy and congeniality has  chilled and temporally retarded its growth and forced it  into the more safe but slower process of making root  instead of top. There is not however the least shadow  of doubt on my mind that the industry will be satisfac-  torily, permanently, and profitably established and all  the benefits claimed for it will be realized and it will  become the head and front and most potent factor of  the producing and manufacturing branch of the financial  power    Very respectfully submitted  Arthur Stayner

I do not want the  responsibility of selecting the kind of machinery therefore desire  Bro Howes' assistance.  Although I wish to go down to Europe  and work a month or two in the Laboratory and ^in fact^ in the  whole Factory of one of their First class establishments  it is in order that I may be thoroughly competent to  have control, but I advocate the employment of thoroughly  experienced & skilled superintendency inside the Factory,  so as to place the contingency of success beyond a  reasonable doubt.  I would make every provision for the  elements of prosperity at the first and future successes will  inevitably accrue.    If you, Brethren, upon whose influence so much of   this enterprise depends, feel like inviting Bro Howe to  do as above it will be a matter of great importance and  largely conducive to our prosperity.

In the presence of so many implied doubts on the part of   my friends, it would appear self-willed and, perhaps, foolishly head-  strong, on my part, to persist in an undertaking of so great conse-  quence and magnitude, as the one concerning which I have written  you. May I not intrude upon your time to lay before you, in brief,   some of the palpable reasons which have induced me to undertake   so great a labor?    I commenced, nearly eight years ago, to search for some business   of production that would relieve the over-burdened ranks of the   Farmers, and occupy their attention in some direction wherein they   would cease to compete against each other in the production of   Wheat. I saw that ranks of the farmers were over-burdened with the   number of persons who did not legitimately belong there. Many   thousands of Tradesmen of various kinds had come here to live. They   could not find the employment which had hbeen their means of support   up to the time of leaving the Old Countries; and, rather than accept

Salt Lake City, Utah,    the bread of dependence, they were obliged to perform some labor, or   enter in to some business, other than that which they were used to.  The farming business opened up the most ready access to supply   their needs; and they thus, measurably ignorant of the business, be-  came competitors against the legitimate farmers. Their lack of   skill obliged them to raise the crop most easily produced,—Wheat;  and their necessities compelled them to be the first in the market  with what they had to sell. Thus, the legitimate farmer was power-  less in maintaining reasonable and paying prices for his product.  And, so long as there was an excess of supply over demand, prices   ruled low and no one was well paid. Hence the necessity of opening   up some other branch of the industry upon which the farming labor   might be employed; in addition to this reason, there also appeared  a still greater one: that a large number of our people are unem-  ployed; that is, failed in securing continuous employment; and while  many were not profitably employed, many others were not employed at   all, and many of our young men, who, failing to find work at home, are   forced to look for employment in Mining Camps and other places   away from the care of parents.    In looking about, then, for a channel into which to direct the   labors of the farming community and others unemployed, I noticed   that we paid out annually a very vast sum for the article of Sugar,

Salt Lake City, Utah,    and thought that if we could succeed in producing here the sugar   that we used, the prolblem was solved, for the time at least.    About this time, word reached me that the government was making  some experiments, looking into the manufacture of sugar from sorghum  and I conceived the idea that it would be a good thing to test,  simultaneously, the capability of the climate and the soil of Utah,   to produce crystalizable sugar; and I concluded that if the exper-  iments of the government, in other places, proved successful, it would  be well for us to know wheither or not it were possible for us to   obtain the benefits of the success; knowing that it is frequently   quite as great an advanteage to know what you can not do, as to know   what you can do.    With this object in view, eight years ago, I commenced these  experiments. Perhaps, if had consulted my friends and sought their   advice at that time, I might have been with-held from running the   risks and performing the difficulties and arduous tasks which I   set myself; but, I did not do so, ans, consequently, no one else but   myself is to blame, or is responsible for the truoubles and anxieties  which I have passed through. And I blame no one; but I am thankful  to say that the conception of the idea has not been barren of re-  sult. I now know, not only what I can not do, but I know what I can   do; and, as I have before had an opportunity of telling you, I have

I further respectfully urge that I make no appli-  cation for financial aid, and unless you are perfectly  willing to take this matter under your tutelary  guardianship upon receiving Bro Howe's report, all I   will ask of you is the permission to use his report in  confirmation of my representations of the possible and probable  benefits and profits of the undertaking.    I have conversed with Bro Howe and upon your  request he is perfectly willing to make the visit.    So far as the adverse report of Wiley Government   Chemist, mentioned by Bro Young, is concerned, I unhesi-  tatingly assert that it is the work of an enemy to the  industry of making sugar from sorghum, and the most  complete refutation of the animus of the report, and  the stultification of him who made it will be found  in what Bro Howe will see and the report he makes  to you upon it. Wiley reports only his absurd failures   and criminal nonsuccesses in the most unblushing man-  ner and in the most dishonest intent stops short of  the splendid success made by his successor at Fort Scott  Prof. Swenson. What Mr Swenson is doing at

Salt Lake City, Utah,    demonstrated, practically, and by actual production, that the climate   and soil of Utah are propitious to the production of crystalizable  sugar.    By the old crushing mill process, it is true, with the present   price of sugar, the business would be but meagrely profitable; but   since the introduction and development of the principle of Diffu-  sion and its magnificent success as applied to sorghum juices, real-  ly doubt^l^ing the out-put, there no longer remains the least doubt,   not only on the practicability, but on the profitableness of the   enterprize; and I now see, and am throughly convinced, that it is   possible for us to save the out-lay of a million dollars a year,  and to save it at a profit of 25%.    You say, in your letter: "If the manufacture os^f^ sugar can be   made a profitable pursuit, there is nothing, that we foresee, in the   future circumstances of the people, that would prompt us to counsel   you not to undertake this business."    This relieves the only dubiety I had in my mind; and I am just   as well assured of the practic^a^le results that will follow well  ordered efforts, as a miller is assured of obtaining so many pounds  of flour from a bushel of wheat, under mill treatment.    I have, for the last eight years, made this matter a study, and   have not been saitsfied to test alone in the laboratory and in the 
 Topeka and Fort Scott gives the direct lie to Wiley's state-  ments and clearly shows the unreliability of the man  and his report.    I am deeply grieved that the interests of this under-  taking should have been retarded even one day by any-  thing so dishonest unworthy and unreliable as Chemist  Wiley's report. On the 2nd March 1887 Hon J. Floyd  King in a speech before the House of Representatives upon the  Sugar manufacture from Sorghun, openly accused Mr  Wiley as follows.    "I charge—First—that this man Wiley has wantonly and  extravagantly spent the money appropriated"    "second—that he is, in my judgment, in the employ of  French & German beetroot sugar manufacturers and  sugar machine builders, and London refiners, whose sole  object is to stagnate all efforts of the Government to aid in  developing our cane sugar industry by the introduction of  the diffusion process"    "That he is working in European sugar interests and against  our own his every official and unofficial act since 1882 shows"

Salt Lake City, Utah,    frying-pan, but I have demonstrated by experiments on so large a   scale as to practically preclude the possibility of a doubt, whether   what is done with the carefulness of the chemist with his phials   and his chemicals in his glass tubes and with his spirit lamp,   can be accomplished when put practically to the test on a large   scale.    Now, Brother Woodruff, can you expect anything else from a man   who has done this much with these motives, than that he should con-  tinue doing, and that he should be willing, knowing as much as I do   about this matter, to risk his all,—his future, upon the issue of   this venture? In my eyes, it is no longer a venture, but a certainty.  There is, it is true, some occasion for alarm in the fact that I am   bereft of the tangible support of the Leaders of the people. I can  not even reach them in conversation to explain in details, and to   place before them, in the thorough manner that is so desirable, the   prospects of success and the means of over-coming difficulties.  And the serious question presents itself, whether or not I can find,  in the hearts of the Latter day saints, in the absence of the in-  spired teachings of their leaders, a sufficient interest for the   establishment of the principle of self-se^u^stenance, to induce them  to embark their means in a project which must appear to them so   vast and difficult of solution. 
 My anxiety for you to be ^correctly^ informed upon these  matters must be my excuse for the length of   this communication.    Very respectfully submitted  Your Brother in the Gospel  Arthur Stayner.    P.S. Will you kindly give me an interview if  this letter needs any further explanation  A Stayner

Salt Lake City, Utah,    For a man to be ci^o^nvinced, and then to lack the courage to "sink or   swim" upon the rightfulness of his convictions, is to be unworthy   of the name of a Latter day saint. For the very basic principle of   the existence of this body of God's people, is the courage to bear   the responsibility of their convictions: and while I do not lay   claim to any especial worthiness, I am thoroughly convinced that   the smallest being in God's Church, can reach His ear, and, if his  motives are worthy and divested of absolute selfishness, can lay   claim to His assistance: and I trust and believe that even as   Peter found the hand of Jesus ready to ^save him, when his lack of faith overcame his power to^ sustain himself^self^ on the sur-  face of the water, even so I may find the hand of the same Provi-  dence that sees the sparrow fall, ready to help me in the hour of  need.

 Jany 20th [189]3    Prests: Wilford Wodruff  George. Q. Cannon  Joseph. F. Smith.    Dear Brethren:    We are very   short of elders: many, whose time has nearly  expired, wish very much to be home at the   Dedication. A number have applied to be released   in time to put in their spring crops, or their years  work is lost. Some must be released in con-  sequence of ill health. All this, makes it nec-  cessary for me to remain in touch with this  office, but I must have a warmer climate   than England.    The devil has had a great  time in Denmark, near Copenhagen. L. C.  Miller, P. C. Gurtsen Jr. and H. C. Hansen, elder[s]  from home, and many of the Aarhus branch   have received great demonstrations through the  visitation of Angels and God Himself (?) through   a Mrs. Jensen, whom this great being called   first a poor woman; but after the elders had  stood guard over her for 11 days and nights,   [c]asting the devil out of her many times, was 
 2    called a pure woman. She gave them con-  stant revelation: how many times the must   administer to her: the particular part of her body   which the enemy got into: and from what I can  learn he invaded every crack and crevice from  head to heels. The elders found a pleasant   nook near the house and dedicated the spot to prayer,  and here they received many precious revelations. Mrs.  Jensen had them The elders administer to her, that   she might ^believe that they believed in her &^ have all [cleave] in her words. Then  claimed that the phrophets Joseph, Brigham &   John were those giving revelation: the accumula-  tion kept on until there was 12 of each kin[d]  they fought over the poor woman all three days and   nights. At the expiration of the allotted time, Mrs.  Jensen became a pure woman (!) She was then   prepared to give the saints, pure counsel. I laid   the matter before the Lord, but did not feel to go there   myself, so wrote to Prest. Christiansen to take conse  with his brethren, and straighten things out. I said   if the Lord had revelations for the people, it would  come from the proper source: these spiritual manif[es]-  tations were evil, and the adversary would li[ke]  to prevent the honest in heart, in that vicinty f[rom] 
 receiving the testimony of the Lord's servants.  I send Bro. George E. Young, son of   Lorenzo D., home: he has been here about  three months: he will tell you his sin, com-  mitted with a woman. I leave it to you, as to the   wisdom of telling this your aged father George said   and said to me, this will hasten fathers death  when he knows it. I have no one here but  Alfred Solomon, that I can leave in charge of   the mission: I have called him to take temporary   charge, while I am away, and if you deem him  suitable, write me, and I will hasten home.  Albert has the spirit of this work, and he should   have the the experience of a travelling elder. Jos. Quinn   is in the office now outside of Willy, there is no   more to get the Star out. Bro. Solomon could not [illegible]  the work. Willy has been ailing, but is now all rig[ht]  Such matters as these, makes me feel to keep in w[ork]  with the office. You know Bro. Solomon as w[ell]  as I do: he is the most experienced we have.  shall try him for two or three weeks, until your  answer comes. So far as I know he amply abl[e]  to tide over until after dedication, but yous are   the best judges. I an sorry the mission is now 
 down: elders are hard to get I know and,   perhaps I have not kept you thoroughly posted   as to our wants: I have tried to do so, and I have  to be forgiven for any negligence witnessed in m[e]  by the Lord, or any brethren. Emigration business  is at a low ebb. The White Star & Cunarder lines:  have things all their own way. Second cabin for   returning [delay saints] nearly twice first cabin   on Guions steamers, which latter have ceased  to run, and may never again [remove] traffic   under the same favorable aspect for our   emigration. We are at sea about emigration water  I dare not leave the mission until you say Bro.  Solomons appointment will be satisfactory, or you [send]  some one else to act intergnum. Would that I did feel   at liberty to go: I would sail on [page torn] [Teutonic] 25th inst.  Many elders are praying to be released, & is my opinion, their   prayers should be answered formally: but in consideration   of high prices charged on the above named lines of   steamers, the expense to the church will be enormous.  I think the bret[h]ern who want to go home, & should   be released, and insist on going on these, put into   under this promise on prices, ought to pay the   difference in pric beween Guions good cabin 
 and the present second cabin rates, or wait  for a few weeks until Guions start their   steamers. True Guions may go to [page torn]  but if the elders wait for their chance  and the Guion Co. fails, they can [3 illegible words]  by the church, which will stand good for their  passage under those circumstances.    Please answer this letter soon [page torn]  can, that I may feel at liberty to  come home.    God bless you [page torn]  are the brethren. Your Brother [page torn]   Brigham Young
