ENDENTRY June 28, 1837    Eunice still employed in teaching school. I had a short interview with Mr Alpha Sage. I spent the latter part of the Day accompaning Sister Eunice in her school a verry interesting time I had to behold my Sister which I had left five years before at our fathers house ownly twelve years of age now teaching the youth with shining accomplishments that grace the female sex. While she was teaching her pupils she presented me with a bundle of Letters fifteen of them were the production of Brother Asahel's pen I perused them with great interest, their contents presented a great variety. After school Sister Eunice accompanied me to Mr Jonathan Stillman's After supper I took the parting hand with Eunice and in company with my Brethren Hale, and Dexter Stillman, I held a meeting in the school house in the evening I preached the gospel of Jesus Christ unto the people &amp; bore testimony unto the truth of the Book of Mormon. I spent the night at Mr Samuel Griswold {distance} 13 miles    taught by Sister Eunice Woodruff. Five hours I spent within its walls amid as great variety of sensations as ever vibr ated my bosom. I beheld my Sister my  ownly Sister seventeen years of age, adorned with youth, modesty, and lovlin ess, her face veiled with the true picture of PHILO. With a degree of admiration I gaz'd upon the change five years had brought upon her. Her spri ghtly step with energy was marked wh ile teaching the young. To more per fectly call to mind the recollection of youth and past scenes and to enterta in my mind amid the passing hours, this Sister presented me, with a cheerful grace, a bundle of Letters from an absent Brother. I look'd them throu gh and throug, they pressed my soul with feelings. Asahel yes thy letters I read fifteen in number to thy sister directed. They brought to my soul as great ^a^ variety of feelings, as matter they contained. They presented before     and the refined talents of a brother presented to a Sister with the most untarnished friendship, and deepest feeling for her wellfare that can grace the human Soul. Such teaching as those to Eunice directed if followed by the female youth would lead them by a thousand snares.

Then at that age I resolved by the grace of God assisting me to be led by the word of God into that truth which maketh free the reby.

After remai ning in this state of mind for near ly the term of four years I herd a report circulated on the 29th day of Dec 1833. that there was to be a meeting held in the neighbourhood by a Mormon priest. This meeting was to be held in the Town of Richland Oswego County New York. I had moved two years previous to this from Connecticut to this place with my older Brother Azmon Woodruff   ENDENTRY December 1833 We had purchased a farm together and been living on it nearly two years. We both were anxious to attend the meeting. Accordingly we we went and found a full cong regation of people. The person that was to preach was Zerah Pulsipher an elder in the Church of Christ or of the latter day saints. He commenced the meeting with some introductory rem arks and then prayed I felt the spirit of God to bear witness that he was the servant of God. He then commenced preaching and that to us with authority, and when he had finished his discourse I truly felt that it was the first gospel sermon that I had ever herd I thought it was what I had long been looking for I could not feel it my duty to leave the house without bearing witness to the truth before the people. I opened my eyes to see my ears to hear my heart to understand &amp; my doors to entertain him who had administered unto us.

And on the 2nd of Jan. ed a branch of the Church of Christ in Richland Oswego Co. N.Y. containing twelve members. He ordained Brother Azmon Woodruff &amp; Brother Noah Hatton Elders and myself a teacher in the Church of Christ. I truly felt that I could exclaim with the servant of God that it was better to be a door keeper in the house of God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness I felt much of the spirit of God bearing witness   ENDENTRY Jan. 2   To the Book of Mormon. I believed it was light out of darkness and truth out of the ground. The license which I receieved reads thus. A Power and authority given to Willford Woodruff provi ng that he is a Teacher in the Church of Christ by the will of God the Father according to his holy Calling and the gift ^&amp; power^ of the Holy ghost agreeable to the Revelations of Jesus Christ signifying that he has been baptized and receieved into the Church according to the articles and Covenants of the same and ordained under the hand of Zerah Pulsipher.

I told Brother Parley our circumstances he told me it was my duty to try to prepare myself and go up to Zion. And accordingly I used evry exertion to settle my accounts arange my affairs and prepare myself to join my Brethren to go to Missourie and on the 10 Warren Ingles called at our house to accompany me on my journey to the west they remained with me and my Brother untill the day following then on the 11 after prepareing my horses and waggon I took the parting hand with my Brother Azmon and his family And also with the Bretheren and Sisters  in the Church and commenced our    ENDENTRY April 1834     Journey for Kirtland which place was appointed to meet at by the first day of May 1834 that all those who were going up to Zion might go together accord ing to the word of the Lord.

Brother Joseph invited    to Mo. 26 April I was introduced to Elder Brigham Young Heber C Kimball. Br Young gave me a Butcher knife    accordingly we did and boarded at his house most of the time for a week here I became not ownly acquainted with him and his family but with many of the brethren both high priests, Elders, and private members those which were making it their home at Kirtland and also those which were gathering for the purpose of going up to Zion. on the 27th of Aprail being the Lords day I attended meeting and herd several of the Brethren preach. Brother Orson  Pratt and others spoke ^Joseph Smith Closing^ during the meeting It appeared to me there was more light made manifest at that meeting   ENDENTRY May 1     God than I had ever receieved from  the whole Sectarian world. According to appointment on the first day of May 1834 we left Missouri there  was not but a small part of the company  left Kirtland untill the Monday following  on account of their not being in readi ness going five days later. There was four  baggage waggons and rising of 20 men  in the company which left Kirtland the  first of May.

As I before said we commenced our march or jour ney on the 8 tage the weather vary pleasant and deligh tful we continued to travel through the day and dwell in our tents at night. I  witnessed many interesting things while on this journey we made it a practice of pitching our tents on Saturday night and not rem ove them untill Monday morning we  had preaching on the Lords day. Brother Joseph often addressed us in the name of the Lord while on our journey and often while addressing the camp he was clothed upon with much of the spirit of God his precepts were verry instructive and interesting. While on our travels   ENDENTRY May 1834    were flung up by the ancient inhabitants  of this Continent probably by the Nephites &amp; Lamanites. we visited one of these Mounds    river three persons dug into the mound &amp; found  a dody. Elder Milton Holmes took the arrow out of the back bones that killed Zelph &amp; brought it with some of the bones in to the camp, I visited the same mound with Jesse J Smith who the other persons were that dug in the mound &amp; found the body I am undecided    took from it the bones of a man. Brother  Joseph had a vission respecting the person he said he was a white Lamanite the curs was taken from him or at least in part. he was killed in battle with an arrow the arrow was found among his ribs, one of his thigh bones was broken this was done by a stone flung from a sling in battle years before his death his name was Zelph some of his bones were brought into the camp and the thigh bone which was broken was put into my waggon and I carried it to Missouri. Zelph was a large thick set man and a man of God he was a warrior under the great prophet ^Onandagus^ that was known from the Rocky mo untains. The above knowledge Joseph receieved in a vision    ENDENTRY May 1834    to See Such a Company of people traveling through the country in perfect order people came forth out of there houses to behold the Scene and thou sands of questions were asked concer ning our movements.
