 Historian's Office, G. S. L. City  October 4th 1856.    Dear Brother C. C. Rich,    Your favor of Sept 8th came to  hand on the 1st inst. It is a general time of health throughout  the Territory so far as we can learn.    Your collections of fruit and flowers will be thankfully  received, and care taken to preserve and propogate from them.  Bro Bullock started on his mission to England on the 10th ult,  and requested Bro Leo Hawkins to receive all fruit cuttings & intended  for him.    There has been, and is a great spirit of reformation throughout  the Territory, especially in Davis County, some of the wards in  that county stepping forth to a man and requesting rebaptism.  Prest Grant baptised upwards of eighty with his own hands.  We never have had such pointed, plain and strong ^mormon^ sermons since  the foundation of the Church, as are now preached by the  Presidency on this subject.    On the 26th ult, the Presidency, with the Brass Band,  a detachment of the Lancers, and a number of the citizens  left the city at 9 a. m., to meet the Hand Cart Companies under  Elders E. Ellsworth and Daniel D. McArthur, they met them  at the foot of the little mountain, and escorted them into the city,  where they arrived about 5 1/2 P.M. The feelings  of the brethren on  meeting them cannot be described; their hearts were so full that  they could not find utterance. The brethren in the different wards  dealt out provisions &c liberally to them. We feel that it is 
 Historian's office. G. S. L. City April 1 1857.    Elder Erastus Snow  Dear Sir,    The Eastern mail arrived on the 24th. Ulto.   bringing the last Oct. & Nov. mails; containing 28 Brass locksacks:  it brought many letters to Prest. Young; and 17 to myself. Among  others, I received letters from Elders Taylor, Geo. A. Smith, E. T. Benson,  J. M. Bernhisel, and one from yourself, bearing date Sep. 25 1856.  The Mail was accompanied by Elder J. L. Heywood, they had to  winter at Devil's gate: the company suffered much from the want  of food. There were about 20 of our brethren there, and they all  lived about one month on ox hides: they left their winter Quar-  ters as soon as they possibly could get through in consequence of   the snow, and it was with great difficulty they got through  when they did. We have not heard any word from the   winter mails, but have learned that the snow was very deep  both East and West of Laramie. We have had more snow  in the mountains and vallies throughout the Territory than we  have ever known before since we came here. The snow is now   off from the vallies, but the mountains are deeply clad. We   have lost but little stock during the past winter in comparison  to the loss we sustained the previous Winter.    We have had much later news from you and the  brethren East via the California mail.    As fas as news is concerned with us in Utah I will  say we are having universal health, peace and plenty throughout  the Territory so far as I know.    Spring has broken upon us warm and mild, every  kind of fruit tree that has suffificiently matured is loaded with 
 Historian's office.  G. S. L. city april 1 1857    Dear bro. Benson    The Eastern mail finally got in on the 24th. Ult.   bringing 28 sacks of mail. It brought the Oct. & Nov. mail: it  brought me over 15 letters from G. A. Smith, J. Taylor, E. Snow &c. and   also your interesting letter from Copenhagen of Sep 30. I should have   been delighted to have been with you on your journey through those old  countries: it must have been very pleasant and I feel to rejoice to  see how the work of the Lord grows in the midst of all opposition,   I know it will grow till it fills the whole earth. Bro. Brigham said  the other night at the prayer circle, that he was satisfied that the Lord  would soon open a door in the midst of all these nations, he said he   would like to send a man to Siberia, and the Japanese islands &c.   There will be a company of Missionaries selected for Europe at the Conference  all will go with hand carts from the vallies to the States: bro. Mack-  intosh is among the number.    We have had a very interesting winter both in the Legislature  and in the church. The Twelve have stood at the head of some  40 missionaries for this city. I have attended a meeting about every evening  for 5 months; the power of God has been with us and much of the  Holy Spirit poured out. We have had some of the loudest preaching  this winter I ever heard, the fruits of the Reformation have been very  visible; the people have confessed their sins, whether they have been great  or small, and made restoration as far as possibleâthe thief has returned  the stollen property or done what they could at it. all have been  down into the waters of baptism commencing with the Presidency 
 Historian's office. G. S. L. City April 1 1857.    Brother Geo. A. Smith; Dear Sir,    I take pleasure in announcing to you  that the Eastern mail arrived on the 24th. Ulto.: bringing 28 brass  lock sacks, having left 2 by the way; it brought the last Oct. & Nov. mail:  anything later we have not heard by the Eastern mail. The mail was  accompanied by our friend J. L. Heywood, they all wintered about Devils  gate with about 20 of the brethren. They suffered much: subsisting  for one month on poor beef, and the next month on Hides. Brother   Heywood considers he has gained quite an experience in cooking raw hides,  they boiled, roasted, stewed and fried all ways; they all lived through it  and left as soon as they could get through for snow, and came near  leaving the mail at last. Many had much anxiety about brother Hey-  wood and all were glad to see him come home: he looks well with his  long sandy beard. The mail brought me 6 letters from you including  the one sent by A. W. Babbitt who, as you know was killed by the way.  I was truly glad to hear from you and that you was preserved in the  railroad smash up.    I was glad to hear that you had got along so well with  bro. Taylor in getting us out so good a history of the death of Joseph.  I have not yet seen it, I have not heard how it was sent, if by  mail, I expect it will turn up by and bye when the Winter mails arrive  I called on Bathsheba and read all my letters to her: she had received  letters from you too. I was pleased with your dream and I believe that   you will be enabled to start the cars engine or no engine that is  visible, it will be all right anyway. We will file it in the office.    We have had a hard winter in Utah if 8 feet of snow in   the vallies, and from 1 to 100 in the mountains makes a hard winter 
 G. S. L. City Sep 30, 1856  Hon. G. A. Smith,  Dear Sir,    At a late hour in the night I seat myself   to write a few lines to you as the mail goes out on the morrow,  it is universal peace, health and prosperity throughout this country  as far as I know. We are having a very favorable fall  to do all kinds of work, except to sow wheat, it still continues  dry, wells are failing. some think the cutting of the timber on  the mountain heights is partially the cause. Our early Frosts have  injured the late corn, wheat has come in quite well considering that  we have had no rain or water. The people are selling their wheat  as usual for $1.00 & $1.50 Flour $2.50 & $3.00 & $400 per cwt.  notwithstanding we have just passed through a famine, these things  ought not to be, for I think the people will want bread before another  harvest. Some brethren have returned from Carson valley, they do not  like the country very well, besides they have to fight their way measur-  ably among the Gentiles. I received a letter from Gen. Rich from   San Bernardino by the mail to day, they are all well there as far  as I can learn. The vigilance committee in San Francisco have dis-  banded, having hung all the wicked, and driven the guilty off.   Elder N. V. Jones has just come in from the lead mines reports all  right in that quarter. We have moved into our new office and find  it much more convenient and very comfortable and refined, we have  got the History as far as the organization of the church with Prest.   Young and the Twelve at its head.    One of the most interesting events of the kind in  this church and kingdom was the arrival of two companies of the 
 Historian's Office   G. S. L. City. Oct 31, 1856    Dear Brother Geo A. Smith,    Although it is the last of   Month the Eastern mail has not arrived, and we do not   expect it until about the 10th or 15th of November, if by any   accident it should chance to drop in on us thenâfor our   present contractors are not at all to be relied on.    Two messengers have just arrived from the hand   cart company under Elder J. G. Willie: When they left, the  company was two miles below Rocky Ridge on the Sweetwater.  They bring bad news of that company; through starting  so late in the season they have got caught in the snow-storms   and many have died. When the teams sent out at conference   arrived at this camp, there had been twenty deathsânineteen   of them men, and while with them in one day there were   fifteen burials, and when the messengers left there had been   fifty five deaths. They did not seem to be sick, but chilled   through: men would dig graves for their brethren, and   before night would die themselves. They had distributed   their last rations the night before relief came to them and   they did not know that any was at hand. Nothing had   been heard of the last company of hand carts. They have   had several severe storms, although there is not so much   snow between here and Sweetwater, as below that point    At least 250 teams have been sent out to meet those   companies, and several tons of flour, and great quantities 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. City  September 30th 1856.    Hon. J. M. Bernhisel,  Dear Sir,    I write to say that your wagon and  three yoke of oxen and goods all came safe. I think Bro  Millett has taken great pains to do well and get the cattle  through. He and his wife have walked all the way, nearly.  One of the oxen was sickly: They were delivered to Brothers  Richards and Cain, and I suppose they have been put upon  the range. The wagon is in my yard, sound and whole. Bro.  Millet had to obtain some things in order to get along, to the  amount of $6 or $8; the flour that was given him was adulterated  with some mineral. He had to leave in storage at Florence,  the following articles, as he had too much load:    1 Parlor Stove.  1 Box Glass  5 Sheets of Iron.  1 Keg Linseed Oil.  1 Keg White Lead, 50 lbs  1 Grass Seed Separator.    Signed, James McGraw  B. Woolley.    I put one of the Boxes in my house, and put into it every  thing you directed which had come. I delivered to Mrs  Bernhisel all the articles as directed, and she called and got  a bill of goods at the retail price, was $146.26.  I have a bill of the articles. 
 like opening the flood gates of deliverance to the thousands of  Europe, who are bound for the want of means; it having been now  proven that this thing can be accomplished, these companies having  travelled about 1400 miles on foot, drawing their provisions and  bedding in hand carts all the way, and beaten every ox team on  the road.    The Deseret State Fair was held in the Deseret Store in  this city on the second, third, and fourth, insts., and it truly was  delightful to witness the splendid display of home manufactured  goods which were there exhibited: it has developed the talent and  ability of Utah's artizans in a degree that exceeded our most   sanguine expectations, and we trust it will give an impetus to  home manufactures which will continue to roll until we no longer  will have to expend the best of our means in the purchase of  imported goods (A report we expect will appear in the Deseret  News). The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing   Society, since their organization have been laboring diligently  to bring about this desirable object, and it is gratifying to witness  the success of their efforts. The plowing match came off on the  2nd inst., on Prest. Young's land immediately south of the city, and  the exhibition of stock on the 3rd.    Elders Jos. A. Young, F. D. Richards, Wm H. Kimball, Geo D. Grant, D. Spencer  John Van Cott, James Ferguson, ^W. C. Dunbar^ C. H. Wheelock & N. H Felt have just  arrived    Yours Truly.  W. Woodruff 
 fruit buds, many ready to burst into blooms. I think we will  have a very fruitful season for fruit, grains and vegetables the   ground is well soaked with water from the recent deep snows.    The big cotton wood canal is nearly finished and will   soon be ready to receive the water for irrigation, and loading the  Granite for the Temple: there are now many stone-cutters at  work around the Temple and we expect their numbers will be   greatly increased after conference; it is pleasing music to hear  the sound of the hammer and chisel again.    The past has been a very interesting winter with us   in Utah. The Presidency, Twelve and many others have been   very busy during the winter holding meetings with the people,  the spirit and power of God has been with us. I have attended  meetings with the Heads or in the Quorums every night through  the week, bro. F. D. Richards has been with me most of the Winter,  L. Snow and O. Hyde part of the time.    We expect A. Lyman and C. C. Rich about the first of  May. I expect they will take a European mission.    The Presidency and most of the Twelve here and many  others are expecting to take a trip North as far as Salmon river.    Brother Erastus, I want to say to you that Brothers Frank-  lin, Lorenzo and myself have often met together and at times  Brother Hyde with us we have often spoke of you & felt,  much to sympathise with you, and felt to sustain you with  our faith and prayers for we do realize that you have had   a great care and labor upon you. I expect Prest. Young will  liberate you this Spring, and send H. S. Eldridge to succeed you  and let you rest from your labors awhile, so I want you 
 Historians office.  G. S. L. City April 1 1857    Elder Taylor   Dear Sir,    Our Eastern Mail for October and November  arrived in this city on the 24th. inst.; containing 28 brass lock sacks;  30 were sent, but 2 of them were deposited somewhere. The Mail  has grown several months old while on the way, mostly at  Devils gate: it was accompanied by our friend J. L. Heywood,  who reports, that while weather bound at the Devils gate, the   company suffered much for the want of food; having subsisted   for one month on Ox hides entirely. The Mail company left   that point as soon as they could possibly get through the snow;  and it was with great difficulty they got through when they  did. The Mail brought Prest. Young a great many letters,  (and to me the following: 2 from yourself, of dates Septem.  16 and October 18 respectively: 5 from Hon. Geo. A. Smith, July 8,   27, Augt. 10, Septem. 14 & Oct 22: Elder Erastus Snow Sept. 25:  Hon. J. M. Bernhisel Sep. 13 and Oct. 15: Elder Joel M. Berry Sep:   1 & Oct. 13, and Messrs. Wm. R. Prince ^Hy^ Oct. 18: Elder E. T. Benson   Copenhagen Sep. 30; and I. F. Carter Portland Maine.) We have   not yet had any word from the Mails of the winter months,  but we have learned that the snow was very deep East as  well as West of Laramie. We have had more snow in the   mountains and vallies through this Territory than we have ever  seen since our settlement in these mountains; yet there has   been but a small amount of stock lost in comparison to the  loss last season.    I was truly gratified to hear from you by letter and 
 followed by the Twelve. Our Tabernacle, school houses, and all places,   of worship have been filled to overflowing throughout the Territory. The  people are paying their Tithing, the public store houses are well filled  with grain. Many are getting wives and their Endowments. Prest. Young  is nearly worn out waiting upon the people day and night. He is   expecting to leave this Spring, with H. C. Kimball the Twelve, (except  myself) and about 100 others on a tour to Salmon river to see the  country.    We have had the most snow ever known in this Territory the  past Winter; snow has fallen in our city over 8 feet deep by measurement;  this has well soaked the ground, and I think we shall have a very  fruitful season, all fruit trees are loaded with fruit buds. They are  getting a head well at Tooele. I see bro. Rowberry frequently, they have  got a reformation at Grantsville: restored Bishop Clark to the Presidency  and Cooley has given it up. Your flouring mill is running, your  family are well. I see sister Benson occasionally. I do not have any  time to visit with my own family.    The Bishops and various companies are sending to the States  for sheep. A good many of us will plant some chinese sugar cane  in the valley this season and try it, we think it will be of great  benefit to us. There has hardly been a Ball or party of pleasure in  this Territory for this six months. I am very busy on the History.    A few will go to California this Spring, some few in the Southern  settlements have started for California, by the short rout called the cut  off. I expect some others will follow them soon for they do not love to dwell  with the righteous. There is a company going to the Santa Clara to   raise cotton. The brethren have made out 1200 lbs of lead and   abandoned the business, as it is very expensive, and does not pay nor  work as well as expected. I shall be pleased to hear from you from 
 ^see next page 455^  seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much  as they have done the past winter and hope it will continue to the power  of God has been with [them] their preaching and teaching in all the   Quorum and Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before  he died, and after his death the burden of the care of the Missionaries  rested upon me and brother F. D. Richards who was unwell considerable,  but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Hyde have been   with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelve (except   myself) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summer Trip North  to Salmon river.    This spring A. Lyman & C. C.  Rich will be with us about the   first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, some missionaries   will be called to Europe and to the islands. President Young would like  to send a mission to Siberia and the Japanese islands. The Lamanites   are doing well, Arrowpeene and Kanosh with other chiefs are making   great improvement. Arrowpeene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle   lately, it was good.    We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or 12.00   lbs; it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected. a cotton   company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going to try the   chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.    All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory.  some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southern settlements   have started on the short roads, [or] cut off to go there,  and no doubt   some others will follow them soon.  Your family are all well, you and   the brethren associated with you are earnestly remembered in our prayers.    As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to  [text continues on the top of the page interlinearly]  the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the   other matters including the history of the Twelve up to the   organization of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the   history of Brigham Young and his fathers family briefly, and now  am at work with the history of the Twelve, from their first organization   in a brief form, taking all that belonged to it, up to the 8   [August] 1844. We have no trouble now with the Gentiles here   [in court] or any where else. It would amuse you to read one of the late   scenes while in court filed in our officeâtoo lengthy to insert,   [with] Dr. Hurt, Gen. Burr and  some smaller fry, to bullyrag   [all our] laws and their defenders, a part of them came armed with   [colts,] revolvers, it ended in T. S. Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's   [dismissal] from the Bar; and some others who intended to use the pistols   went out of the house in the form of a sled using the seat of   their honor for runners, dropping their loaded weapons while going   [rest of page illegible] 
 hand cart trains. the Presidency with many others, and a company   of Lancers went out to meet them in the mountains, they met  them about the foot of the little mountain, it was an effecting  scene, after passing the greetings and salutations they formed to  come into the city, one half of the Lancers in front followed  by the presidency, citizens, band and marshal, then followed 500  men, women and children drawing their 100 hand carts, which they   had drawn 1400 miles, the rear was brought up by the Lancers.   As they went through the city, the Streets were crowded with thousands  of people who stood and gazed with wonder and amazement tiars  starting in their eyes, the scene was beyond description, to behold  old men women and children covered with dust dancing with joy  as they passed along it filled our hearts until we were spechless,  we felt that the flood gates of deliverance to the millions of the   oppressed were hoisted, and we could say to the poor Saints "come  home to Zion",  for your way is open. Elders Ellsworth & Mcarthur  have gained great honor to themselves by leading that brave  company of hand cart pioneers, they walked all the way, helped  along the carts, healing the sick and comforting the weak all they could,  and when they arrived in the city, they continued at the head of   their companies, drawing the hand carts covered with dust, till their  companies were safely encamped on the Public square, and were fed by  the presents of the populace: then the brethren went to see their  own families. Prest. Young has been sanguine all the time that  travelling with hand carts was a safe and practical operation, &  it has now been proved to be so. the company declare the few  ox teams they had were a hindrance to them, they had to wait 
 of clothing.    Brother Smoot had to leave 100 head of cattle at   Bridgets, and most of his freight.    The President has suggested the idea of establishing   posts, one at devil's gate, one at Wood River, one at Deer  Creek, and one below Laramie, to put a stop to so late   starting.    The Presidency started East to meet the Immigration   but while on Kanyon Creek Prest Young was taken so  severely ill that the company was obliged to return.    Your family are all well.    Yours truly.  W Woodruff 
 Brother Cain has drawn some wood with your oxen to  your house. Houtz has begun to bring some flour of late.  His Mill does all the grinding in that place: he runs it  nearly night and day.    I have written to Hon. Geo. A. Smith some of the   news of the day with us, the arrival of the Hand Cart  companies, the Reformation &c.    Your family are all well. It is a general time of  health.    Yours truly,  W. Woodruff 
 G. S. L. City July 1 1857    Brother Lyman Wight  Dear Sir    I take the liberty of addressing a  few lines to you for various reasons, one is for old acquaintance sake,  and another for the purpose of making a request of you, and upon  this subject I will write first, it is this. During the last year I   have been engaged in writing the History of the church and especially  the History of the Twelve. I am taking up the Quorum from the  commencement, have been trying to write your History but I cannot do  justice to it at all without your assistance, and on the receipt of  this I wish you would write a sketch of your life and forward it  to me to this city, name your lineage or forefathers as far back as  you can get, with anything you know about them, and where you  was born and when, what your religion was before you embraced   the Gospel, where you was baptized and who by and all your  ordinations, and by whom ordainedâan outline of all your missions.  Was you not in the war of 1812? What offices have you ever held  in church or state. I want you to give me the particulars of your  conversation with General Wilson the night you was taken prisoner  when he wanted you to betray Joseph, that was an important time  with you, and for that deed alone you shall have salvation; give  me an account of your going with Judge Higbee some 6 or 7 miles to   intercept a company of 40 men going I think to Jackson County also  of the 7 men armed, who chased you on a certain occasion, when you  leaped a ditch with your horse which the others could not leap, and   any incident of your life that should be preserved as History; please 
 time to time to know how you get along: it seems our brethren  at Washington have not been able to accomplish anything with our  imorial for a State government yet, but I believe that the Lord  will govern it all right.    If we have any more emigration from England this Spring  or Summer, I hope they never will start so late as they did last season:  it cost this city and territory more to get them brought through the   snow, than it would to have paid their fare all the way from Liverpool.   during emigration time it was by miracle almost that they were saved  at all, about every horse and mule team within 40 miles of here had  to go out in the mountains from 1 to 10 weeks. I lost my lot frm  horse and wagon left &c: it cost tens of thousands of dollars to close  up the operation. My love to all who inquire after me.    As ever I remain,  yours truly,  W. Woodruff 
 to keep up good courage, do what you can and dont worry about  the rest. I feel as though the Lord will sustain you, and bring you  home in peace.    In answer to your inquiry about the proportionments of the   Deseret alphabet Fonts; I would say I had that portion of your letter  read to Prest. Young, and he said your letter of instructions expressed  the desired information, which he would have re-copied and sent you  again by this mail. He wishes you to get a few made, not as full  font, but some of each kind and have them tried, and see if they   will work, then to bring on the ma[illegible]s and pictures so that we  can make those here as we have a good deal of old type, [but] as  you will have a bill of instructions again from him upon the subject  I need not enlarge further. I hope you will be successful in this matter.  The Presidency are very singly busy in the Endowment house.    Enclosed you will find a letter to Geo A. Smith which  if he is with you, or in, the States please forward to him: Your   family and all the families of the Twelve are well. I have been  so busy during the winter in attending meetings and the labors of   my office that I have hardly had any time to visit any body, hardly   my own familys. I feel to pray with all my heart that the Lord  will bless and sustain you, in your work and missions, and that you  may have grace equal to your duty and return again in peace, to  your family and friends during the Summer.    As ever, I remain  Yours truly  W. Woodruff 
 ^from page 455^    earnestly remembered in our prayers.    As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to  the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the other   matters including the history of the Twelve up to the organization  of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham  Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on the  history of the Twelve from their first organization in a brief form  taking all that belonged to it up to the 8 August 1844. We have  no trouble now with the Gentiles here in court or anywhere else. It  would amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filed  in our officeâtoo lengthy to insertâwith Dr. Hurt, Gen. Burr and   some smaller fry, to bullyrag all our laws and their defenders, a  part of them came armed with colts, revolvers, it ended in T. S.   Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's dismissal from the Bar; and  some others who intended to use the pistols went out of the house  in the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for run-  ners, dropping their loaded weapons while going out, which they   never afterwards found. all has been quiet since, having but little   lawing on hand.    Please not expose my succatash letter to the press, for  I write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I would   while writing to men who publish papers.    Gen. Burr has written to the department as we are  informed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timber  in the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Spring  of going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and taking   a ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on the  top of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not cost  all it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leaving  him to be the judge. yours truly W. Woodruff 
 several hours each day for them, they consider they would have been  here 10 days sooner without them, were provisions left at various  points for them, they came through in about 9 weeks and a   few days.    We are in the commencement of a great reformation, the  Presidency are preaching the strongest and most heart searching &   powerful sermons that I ever heard delivered in the church and  kingdom of God, they are weighing the people in the balances   and the people are found wanting, the President has called  upon the people en masse to repent and be baptized for the  remission of sins and they are following their council by whole   wards in some places, and I expect it will be the case in this  city.    The Southern Company brought in the small pox with  them but it has not spread much yet.    We are making great preparations for our State fair to be  held in the Deseret store. The awarding committees occupy it to  morrow to adjudge upon the various articles which may be  presented, then it will be open to the public, it would do your  soul good to go through the building and see what the people  have produced in this valleyâit is really a rich treat.    Your family are all well. Bathsheba is on one of the  awarding committees. George A. works very smart, our peaches  grapes and apples are doing very well this season. All wish   to be remembered to you in the office. P. P. Pratt, T. Bullock &  company started to the States, the middle of the month.    yours truly W. Woodruff 
 Historian's office,  G. S. L. City April 1 1857.    Elder Orson Pratt,  Dear brother    The Cala. mail for Feby. arrived here March  4th. bringing packages containing the pamphlet entitled the "Holy   Spirit." The Eastern mail for Oct. and Nov. arrived on the 24th. Ult.  bringing packages of your pamphlets entitled "The true faith" "True Re-  pentance" and "water baptism," which have been distributed according to  the respective addresses. This mail has been detained during the Winter  in the mountains, by the severity of the weather and the unusual  depth of snow. Elder Joseph L. Heywood was with the Mail and suf-  fered very much on account of the lack of provisions. They lived one  month on Hides, boiled and prepared in the best manner they could.  It has been reported the snow was very deep on the plains Eastward.    There is quite a spirit manifested this Spring through the Territory  in the cultivation of fruit, many are selling out fruit trees of all  kinds that can be obtained. There is every prospect for a very fruitful  season of fruit, grain, and vegetables; the Earth is well saturated from  the moderate melting of large bodies of snow.    The Temple block begins to assume its industrial appearance, &  already the huge blocks of rock, are being brought from Red Bute on  which the sound of the hammer and chisel again are heard.    The big cotton wood canal is nearly finished so that we expect  water to be more plentiful in this city, as well as on the farming lands.   Theire has been organized a company to raise cotton on the Santa Clara  under the superintendence of bro. I. C. Haight.    There is quite a number of parcels of chinese sugar cane here,  and many others on the way which will be cultivated with care and 
 to learn that you had prepard for us an account of the mar-  tyrdom of the Prophet. I did not learn in what way you   intended to forward it to u[s], whether by mail or private conveyance;  if by mail I expect we will have it when the Winter mails get  in. We have had mu[c]h later news from you and the brethren,  through the Mormon, and by letters via California; than we  received by the last Eastern mail. The Mormon keeps us  well posted up u[p]on matters and things in general in the  East. We can [c]learly see that you have had a strong war-  fare upon your hands since your residence in New York, &  I believe all your friends in Utah feel that you have ably  defended yourself; and maintained the cause of truth and  that victory has been with you as an able Editor and a   champion of rights. I consider the Mormon has been from  the commencement as a sharp thorn in the side of the enemies  of Zion, and a powerful engine in the defence of the truth  and has been an instrument in the hands of God of   doing much good.    As far as news is concerned with us in Utah I will   say that we are having universal health, peace and plenty  throughout the Territory so far as I know.    Spring has broke in upon us warm and mild, snow  having disappeared ^in the vallies^; though the mountain and hills still wear  their white mantle, and are deeply clad with snow.    The big cottonwood canal is nearly finished and will  soon receive the water for irrigation, and also for canal purposes,  by which we will be able to boat the Granite rock from the  Big cottonwood kanyon to this city, for building the Temple. 
 forward to me soon. Give my respects to Sister Wight, Orange,  and any with whom I am acquainted.    We are all well, it is a general time of peace, health and  plenty in this Territory at presentânever a better prospect for crops.  Our Eastern mail arrived on the 23rd inst. being the quickest trip ever   made (25 days) from Independence 1200 miles.    We are informed all hell is boiling over against the Mormons.  Parly P. Pratt was murdured in Arkansas, by one McLeanâhe was  shotâlived 2 hours. T. B. Marsh is on the way to this placeâwishes   to be forgiven and to return to the church again.    I wish Brother Wight you would come and pay us a visit.  we will all be glad to see you. we have built up a beautiful city  in the valley of the Mountains. Our census makes us about 80,000  souls and increasing fastâmormonism is as great a trouble to   the world as ever. All the Twelve are now in this country except  O. Pratt, E. T. Benson, Erastus Snow and John Taylor who are abroad  Amasa Lyman and C. C. Rich arrived a short time ago from San  Bernardino, and Geo. A. Smith from Washington.    I hope you will not fail to write me by the next mail  Will you tell me who baptized Wm. E. McLellan and when?  My family are all well. I have but one son grown up 17 year  old named Wilford and a good boy. My Father is with meâ  80 years oldâis able to work about every day. I baptized him 20  years ago, and brought him to this valley. I find the world is   much bothered to know what to do with Utah. Brigham, Heber  and Orson Hyde are all well.    I remember old times we have spent many a good day  together, and I wish we could spend many more. Mormonism is 
 G. S. L. City Feb. 28 1857    Elder Orson Pratt    Dear Bro. The Cala. mail for January arrived here  Feby. 4 having encountered much deep snow. The Eastern mail has not  arrived yet.    The weather for the last week has been moderately warm; snow  disappearing fast, in many places the ground is now bare, inviting the   Plough and the spade of the agricultarist: some have commenced Gardening.   Many wards have about finished their labors on the Big Cottonwood canal and  the prospect for water this season is encouraging.    Sab. 22 A list of Missionaries for Europe and the islands was  called off, to which it is anticipated more will be added; there was also  read a list of names called to accompany Prests. Young & Kimball on  their Northern trip to Salmon river to start after the April conference.    I earnestly desire O. Pratt that you should write out a short sketch  of your life for the church History. We have now come in the History compil-  ation to the period when Prest. Young with his brethren of the Twelve Preside  over the church, and we give a short history of each of the Twelve say  from 8 to 12 pages foolscap, which be pleased to forward by return mail  as we will in all probability be waiting on it.    Say to br. Benson the same will be required of him when  the history comes up to the date of his ordination.    Please also tell br. Phinehas that we want a brief sketch of his  life as we are compiling a short sketch of each one of the Brothers and sisters  of bro. Brigham, their families, their missions, and important events in their lives.  all these sketches will be required from your birth till Augt. 8 1844 when the   history of the church becomes the history of Br. Brigham, and takes all his  brethren from that date along daily, as Josephs history did. We also wish 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. City  September 30th, 1856.    Elder O. Pratt  Dear Brother,    As the mail will soon leave, I   improve a few moments to keep you advised of matters with  us. It is a general time of health and peace throughout  our Territory: all things are going right and prospering.    One of the most interesting scenes that was ever witnessed   in our Territory was the arrival of two of the Hand Cart  Companies, on the 26th inst. Having heard the night   previous that they were camped between the two mountains,  Presidents Young and Kimball, and many citizens, with  a detachment of the Lancers, and the Brass Bands,  went out to meet them and escort them into the city. They  met the companies at the foot of the Little Mountain.  Elder E. Ellsworth led the First Company, and Elder Daniel  D. McArthur, the Second; and after the meeting and  salutations were over, amid feelings which no one can  describe, the escort was formed, a party of Lancers leading  the advance, followed by the Bands, the Presidency, the  Marshal, and Citizens; then came the companies of Hand  Carts, another party of Lancers bringing up the rear.   Bishop Hunter, Capt. L. W. Hardy and myself fell in  with the escort as they entered the city, and I must  say my feelings were inexpressible: to behold a company-   of men, women and children, many of them aged and  infirm, enter the city of the Great Salt Lake, drawing 100 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. City  November 4th 1856    Dear Brother O. Pratt    Although it is the 4th of November the  Eastern mail has not arrived, and thinking the California  mail would be safer than the Eastern, under McGraw and  Co. we write you by it.    On the 4th ult. Elders Franklin D. Richards, Joseph  A. Young, William H. Kimball, George D. Grant, Daniel  Spencer, John Van Cott, James Ferguson, C. H. Wheelock, N. H.   Felt, William C. Dunbar, James McGaw, J. D. T. McAllister,  and C. G. Webb, arrived all in good health.    The October Conference was numerously attended, it  is estimated that at least 12 thousand persons assembled  in the Bowery, and were addressed by most of the  returned missionaries, with much spirit and energy.    Capt Croft's company from the Cherokee nation  arrived on the 11th ult:    On the 13th ult. The First Presidency with a small  company started East to meet the emigration, but while on  East Kanyon Creek Prest. Young was taken so severly ill   that the company was obliged to return.    On the 25th ult. The Rev C. R. Van Emmons, a  missionary from the Bible Society arrived with about a  Ton and a half of Bibles for sale and distribution    At 9 A. M. on the 31st Brothers Gideon D. Gibbs and  Horace Newell arrived with an express from Bro Willie's company 
 Phinehas' by return mail, as we are almost waiting for it now.    Bro. Bullock would no doubt take pleasure in assisting you  to get your sketch of history up.    yours truly    W. Woodruff    Be pleased at sometime Br. Orson to tell us where and how you  spent the 27 June 1844.    Bro. Phinehas H. Young  Dear Bro,    Will you favor us with a brief sketch  of your life, for the church history in connexion with the Young family,  name your religion before embracing mormonism, where & when you was  baptized, and by whom. Your ordinations, offices, by whom, short  synopsis of your missions, with the number baptized, your marriages &  children &c. up to Augt. 8, 1844. We have an account of all  the family but you, and shall be pleased to have yours by   return of mail.    All is well in Zion.    yours truly.  W. Woodruff 
 attention by us, we think it will be a benefit to this Territory.    The Saints in the various wards in the city have been rebap-  tized; the example was set them by the first Presidency: the fruits  of the Reformation has been made manifest throughout this Territory  in many things, among which is a great increase in Tithing grain,  which will help to bread the brethren who work at the Temple.    There will be a company of Missionaries start for Europe after  conference, and some to the islands. Many have received their ordinances  and blessings in the house of the Lord this Spring; some of the brethren  from Iron County and many from the country Settlements.    The Board of Directors of the D. A. & M. Society have again  published their lists of Premiums, amounting to over $1000 besides  silver, medals, and Diplomas, for the encouragement of home man-  ufactures, and the production of articles from the native elements.    The attention of many in this city and territory has been  called to the importance of the Sheep raising, and as we have so  limited a supply in this Territory, companies are forming to send  to the States for larger supplies; realizing that as a community we can  never attain to that commercial independence necessary to our prosperity  and welfare, until we can grow our own wool and cotton and supply  the market with home manufactured cloth. I think we have a fair   supply of bread to sustain the inhabitants until another harvest.    It is a general time of health and peace throughout this Territory  all is peace with the Indians, Arrowpeene, Kanosh, and many of the  chiefs are becoming quite civilized, and using a good influence with their  Tribes to promote peace, civilization and industry, in the cultivation of the  earth. Arrowpeene made a speech in the tabernacle a short time since  to a large assembly, and all of his teaching, council, and instruction 
 There are many stone cutters now at work upon the  Temple block, and after conference there will be a large addition:  it is sweet music to hear the sound of the hammer and   chisel in the hands of so many men. we expect to push  the work of the temple this season.    We have every prospect of a very fruitful season. Peaches,  apples, Plums, apricots and currants are all loaded with fruit  buds, and some nearly ready to bloom. we have also a fair   prospect for Grain as far as we can judge.    The past has been a very interesting Winter in Utah to  the Latter day Saints, the inhabitants almost universally have  assembled themselves together in their towns, cities, wards, settle-  ments branches and quorums, and spent their Sabbaths and winter  evenings in preaching, teaching, prayer and praise unto the Lord;  and much of the Holy Spirit has been enjoyed in all the  assemblies of the Saints, in every capacity in which they have  met and such a thing as a Ball or party for recreation has  hardly been heard of throughout the Territory. The power  of God has rested upon the Presidency, the Twelve, and the  Elders of Israel and they have been inspired to impart a   great amount of teaching, counsel and knowledge unto the  people, and the fruits of the spirit of God has been visibly   manifested among the people; and they have greatly rejoiced   in the Lord. I have attended a meeting of some kind  almost every night through the Winter months.    The Presidency with many others are preparing to  make a trip to Salmon river settlement this Spring visiting  the Northern branches as they go. 
 Historian's Office  Great Salt Lake City  September 30th 1856.    Editor of the Luminary    Dear Sir,  The people throughout this  Territory are enjoying good health so far as we can learn:  there have been a few cases of small pox on Big Cottonwood,  but nothing serious.    On the morning of the 31st ult. [last month] a fire broke out in the  Public Blacksmith's shop, but was extinguished without   doing much damage.    On the 10th inst. we moved into our new office, opposite  the President's and Governor's offices; it is a very pleasant  location, and the building is much more suitably adapted  for the purpose of compiling history than the one we have  previously occupied    Elders Parley P. Pratt, Thomas Bullock, Bernard  Snow, Samuel F Neslen, George Gates, and a number of  other missionaries for the States and Europe left on the  same day.    I took a trip to the Sugar Works, on the evening  of the 11th and preached to the Saints on the necessity  of encouraging Home Manufactures.    Elder Preston Thomas arrived in this City from  Texas on the evening of the 12th inst. in advance of his  company which arrived on the 16th.    During the night of the 19th Brother Lufkin's cabinet 
 as good to me to day as it was when I was with you in  the old log cabin in Clay County, and milking the cows for Sister  Wight and making brick for col. Arthurs house. All the world  will find it is true in the end. We are living in an important   day and God is bringing about his purposes and the Devil is  a trying too. Great things are at the door.    I say again br. Lyman come and see us, we will  not hurt you, but try to do you all the good we can. Elders  Geo. A. Smith, A. Lyman, and C. C. Rich have just come  in and say, send our best respects to br. Lyman Wight.    Direct to Great Salt Lake city. Utah.    Respectfully yours  W. Woodruff.    N. B.

 Phinehas' by return mail, as we are almost waiting for it now.    Bro. Bullock would no doubt take pleasure in assisting you  to get your sketch of history up.    yours truly  W. Woodruff    Be pleased at same time Br. Orson to tell us where and how you  spent the 27 June 1844.    Feby 28 1857  Bro. Phinehas H. Young    Dear Bro,  Will you favor us with a brief sketch  of your life, for the church history in connexion with the Young family,  name your religion before embracing mormonism, where & when you was  baptized, and by whom. Your ordinations, offices, by whom, short  synopsis of your missions, with the number baptized, your marriages &  children &c up to Augt. 8, 1844. We have an account of all  the family but you, and shall be pleased to have yours by  return of mail.    All is well in Zion.    your truly,  W. Woodruff 
 hand carts, (led by Bro Ellsworth, who assisted in drawing the  first hand cart,) with which they had travelled some 1400 miles  in 9 weeks, and to see them dance with joy as they travelled  through the Streets, complaining of nothing, only that they had  been detained by the ox teams that carried some of their provisions,  as they had to wait for them several hours each day, the oxen not  being able to keep up with them: they say if it had not been for   these teams they would have been in ten days sooner. This  sight filled our hearts with joy, and thanksgiving to God: Yes  our hearts swelled until we were speechless with joy, and not with   sorrow. As I gazed upon the scene, meditating upon the future  result, it looked to me like the first hoisting of the flood gates of  deliverance to the oppressed millions; we can now say to the  poor, and honest in heart, Come home to Zion; for the way is  prepared. As the companies entered the city, and passed on  to the public square, the Streets were thronged with thousands  of people gazing upon the scene, which looked more like the  dream of a night vision than a reality. They pitched their  tents upon the Public Square. President Young called  upon the Bishops and people to carry them food while  they remained there; in a short time we could see loads of  provisions going to their encampment. There has never been  a company enter these vallies that has had the honor and  respect paid to them that the Hand cart companies have;  and Elders Ellsworth and McArthur have gained honor and  glory In leading these brave companies: they have walked all  the way, and assisted in drawing the hand carts to Zion, and 
 of hand carts, bringing bad news. Through starting so  late in the Season, many of them have died; when the  messengers arrived at this camp twenty had diedânineteen  of them men; and when they left fifty had died. In order   to put a stop to so late starting another year, The Presidency  talk of establishing posts along the road, for the storage of   provisions &c, viz: at Kearny, Wood River, Laramie, Deer Creek,  and Devil's Gate.    Altogether about 26,668 lbs of flour, 250 teams, and   great quantities of clothing have been sent out to meet the  immigration, and assist them in.    The spirit of reformation is still cutting its way through  the different settlements in these vallies; the saints are begin-  ning to wake up to a sense of their duties, and the responsibilites  they owe to their God. The Presidency are actively engaged   in the field, and wield the the arrows of the Almighty with a  force and precision that carry conviction to every heart, and  causes the miners in Zion to tremble, and fearfulness to surprise  the hippocrite. The returned missionaries have been appointed  "Home Missionaries," and they also have entered their field  of labor, which at present is mostly confined to Great Salt Lake  City, and are doing much good.

As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to  the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the other   matters including the history of the Twelve up to the organization  of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham  Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on the  history of the Twelve from their first organization in a brief form  taking all that belonged to it up to the 8 August 1844. We have  no trouble now with the Gentiles here in court or anywhere else. It  would amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filled  in our officeâtoo lengthy to insertâwith Dr. Hurt, Gen. Burr and   some smaller fry, to bullying all our land and their defenders, a  part of them came armed with Colts revolvers, it ended in I. S.   Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's dismissal from the Bar and  some others who intended to use the pistols went out of the house  in the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for run-  ners, dropping their loaded weapons while going out, which they   never afterwards found. all has been quiet since, having but little   lawing on hand.    Please not expose my succatash letter to the press for  I write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I would   while writing to men who publish papers.    Gen. Burr has written to the department as we are  informed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timber  in the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Spring  of going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and taking   a ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on the  top of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not [cut]  all it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leaving  him to be the judge. yours truly W.

 would prove a blessing to the Saints, and the whole christian world  should they follow it. He is a very sensible man, and preaches  sound doctrine, which is the case with Kanosh the Pauvan [Pahvant] chief, who  is learning his tribe to raise their own bread. There are no Indians  in North America who have been so wisely dealt with, kindly treated  as well as fed, and clothed according to the resources at command, or that  are in as propserous a condition for civilization and industry, according to the  circumstances in which they were found as those Indians which come under  the supervision of Governor Young who presides over the Territory of  Utah. For the Indians of this Territory were unlike the Cherokees and  many other Tribes, who had been connected with civilization and white men  for half a century but when Governor Young found them 10 years ago,  they had but few of them even seen the face of a white man: but  were sunk to the lowest degree of degradation and misery, that human  beings were capable of existing under, but the wise and humane policy  of Gov. Young has fed, clothed and exalted those degraded beings in  the scale of intelligence, industry and civilization, and bettered their condition  in regard to the world in a manner which has been unequalled in our  day.    Yours truly,   W. Woodruff.    P. S. Your family are all well so is brother Bensons I had a good  letter from him. I have written a few lines which I enclose him in   your letter. Be pleased to forward the same to him.    WW 
 Historian's office  G. S. L. City July 1 1857    Ed. of Millennial Star    The Eastern mail from the U. S. arrived on the 23rd  Ulto. in charge of br. Ephraim K. Hanksâ23 days from Independence,   one of the shortest trips on record.    Elders Amasa Lyman and Chas. C. Rich have arrived from  San Bernardino, the former with the Cala. mail June 3, the latter on  the 8th with a small Coy. [company] of Saints; subsequently another small company  arrived from San Bernardino, who brought along a seven stopped organ   donated to the church by the Australasian Saints; which is being fitted  up in the Tabernacle at the North end, by br. Joseph Ridges who built  it in Australia. Prests. Young, Kimball, & Wells and Elders Geo. A. Smith A.  Lyman and others stepped in on Sabbath last, and heard brs. Ridges &  Orson Pratt Jr. play upon the organ, with which they expressed themselves  much gratified. It is a valuable acquisition to our choir.    Elder Geo. A. Smith has visited Utah Co. since his arrival,  found the people of Provo in good health and Spirits, with excellent prospects  for grain this season: attended a sabbath school meeting with 300 scholars,  and preached to a congregation of about 3000 Saints in the Bowery.    Brethren from Iron Co. report very favorably in relation to the   crops in cedar & Parowan, also in Beaver Co.    By the arrival of the May mail we learned of the agitation of  the public press in the U. S. pertaining to Utahâher Governorâand  the Saints. Never at any former time have we witnessed a more universal  better feeling against Mormonism than at the present. Gov. Young thinking   the working bees of Utah would not take time to read what the pub-  lic press say in relation to them and himself, set apart Sab. June  14th. at 8 a.m., to have some of the most rabid articles read to 
 I think we have a fair supply of bread for the inhabitants  until another harvest. The fruits of the Reformation have been  manifested in a greater degree than ever before in keeping the  law of Tithing which is finding bread for the public hands on  the Temple &c.    Elders A. Lyman and C. C. Rich are expected about the  first of May. I expect they will take a European mission.    Your family and the families of all the brethren with  you are all well as far as I can learn except the youngest son  of J. N. Bernhisel has been sick for a few days past.    That the peace and blessings of God may rest upon you,  in all of your exertions and labors to promote the cause of truth;  and upon those connected with you, is my sincere and earnest  prayer.    yours truly  W. Woodruff    P. S. Should you make any use of any portion of this letter in  the Mormon I think it would be well to omit the receipt of letters  and their dates, as they were merely inserted for your eye.    W. W. 
 shop was destoyed by fire: the amount of damage was estimated  at $15000.    A large company of Danes led by Brother Peterson  arrived on the 20th.    At 9 A.M. of the 26th Presidents Young and Kimball,  with the Brass Band, a attachment of the Lancers, and a  very large number of the citizens started to meet the 1st  and 2nd companies of hand carts, under Elders Edmund   Elsworth, and Daniel D. McArthur.  They travelled to  the foot of the little mountain, where they met the companies  and escorted them into the City, where they arrived about  5 1/2 P.M. The feelings of the brethren when they met  them cannot be described; their hearts overflowed with  gratitude to their heavenly Father that the lives of those faith-  ful brethren and sisters had been preserved throughout their  toilsome journey. There has been less sickness and death  in these companies, than in any ^other^ company that ever crossed  the plains, there being only 7 deaths out of 486 souls.  The only complaints we have heard them make is that  they were detained by a few ox teams in their company;  if it had not been for these, they say they would have  been in some few days sooner, as they had to wait several  hours daily, for these teams to reach their camp.    By these companies Elders Edmund Ellsworth, Daniel  D. McAthur, John Oakley, Truman Leonard, and Spicer  W. Crandall, returned missionaries arrived.    Great preparations are making for the Deseret State Fair 
 Historian's office  G. S. L. City June 1 1857    Ed. of Mill. Star    Dr Sir,    The past month has been one of unusual peace and   quietness in this city; the monotony of which has been relieved by the   arrival of Gov. Young and Company on the 26th and the Eastern   may mail on the 29th, by which we are happy to announce the   safe arrival of Elders Geo. A. Smith, J. M. Bernhisel and T. O. Angel.    The weather was cold during the fore part of last month   with occasional showers which mostly fell on the mountains around  the valley. The frost on the morning of May 9th killed the Beans,   Potatoe vines, and injured the fruit blosoms: the weather for the   latter part of May has been very warm and dry.    Crops are promising throughout the Territory.    Water is abundant in the streams, the water sects in the   city are overflowing, and the waste water race in North Temple street   carries of much surplus water.    The health of the inhabitants of the Territory is excellent;   and since the opening spring has washed away with the tide of   emigration many of the half hearted Saints; the moral elements    feel considerably clearer.    Prest. Young gave a short sketch of his late tour on   the stand yesterday, said he had heard much concerning the country  Northward; but all he had heard had failed to impress his mind   with a correct idea of the sterrility, barrenness, mountainous and broken   condition of the country: the company travelled 762 miles in 1 month  and 2 days, had a laborious journey, which however was rendered   agreeable by the unanimity, harmony and good feelings manifested. 
 they have healed the sick, and strengthened the weak, by  night and by day, and when those worthy elders entered the  City, they remained at the head of their companies covered  with dust, drawing a hand cart like the rest of their bretheren.  Elder Ellsworth, while passing his own house, and seeing his  wives and children standing in the door did not stop to speak  to them, but only saluted them while passing, and remained   with his company until they were encamped and fed.    There were but seven deaths in Elder Ellsworth's company,  and less in McArthur's, during the whole journey, although  many were aged, and feeble; women and children have  drawn hand carts all the way. No oxen that could be  put upon the road could keep up with them.    President Young has been sanguine from the beginning,  that it was a safe and practical enterprize, and it has now  been proven to be so; and I feel that we can say to the saints  in all the world, Let your hearts be comforted, have faith   and trust in God, call upon him in mighty prayer, be  faithful, and follow the counsel of the servants of God, and  lay up all that you can to help you over the sea, and your  deliverance is nigh, even at the door.    The Presidency of the Church have commenced a   great reformation among this people in the vallies of the   mountains. I have never heard as strong sermons del-  ivered to the people, as have been preached unto them of   late. The Presidency are weighing the people in the balance  and are calling upon them to repent and be baptized for the 
 Ed. of Mill. Star    G. S. L. City apl. 30 1857    Dear Sir,    April 6, 7, 8 & 9 was the 27th annual conference   held by the church of Jesus Christ of L. D. S. and one of the most   interesting I ever attended.    The teachings of the First Presidency were rich indeedâ  pointing out the onward course of Israel, and urging upon the   Saints to lay up grain against the days of famine.    There were 11 missionaries appointed to the U. S., 13 to the   Sandwich Isles, 33 to Europe, 22 to Canada and 2 to California.    One very interesting scene transpired at the close of the   conference: the sons of the Prophets and apostles were called up   on the stand, and to speak before the assembled people. Their words  were few but generally well ordered. Amongst the number were Joseph  A. & Brigham Young Jr. William H. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt Jr., Orson  Pratt Jr., and Heber John Richards    In some wards in the city most of the young men have   been ordained and set to work in the Priesthood as Teachers & Deacons.    The weather for the past month has been very dry, and   irrigating has been resorted to, to start the Spring crops.    34 brethren were selected this Spring to make a   settlement on the Rio Virgin for raising cotton; and over 100 have 
 Historian's office  G. S. L. City July 1 1857    Editor of Mormon    The Cala. mail arrived on the 3rd June, by   which Elder Amasa Lyman arrived safely in our midst. On the 8th Elder  Charles C. Rich arrived in good health and spirits, with a small company.    June 12th. A few brethren arrived from San Bernandino, bring-  ing the seven stopped organ donated to the church by the Australasian Saints,   which was left at San Bernardino, and has been forwarded by the generosity   of the brethren there to this point. Br. Joseph Ridges who made the   organ is fitting it up in the Tabernacle, at the North end; and when   the weather is cool, and the congregation resume meeting in the Taberna-  cle it will be a soul stirring accompaniment to the choir.    By the arrival of the May mail we learned of the agitation   of the public press in the U. S. pertaining to Utah,âher Governorâ   and the Saints. Never at any former time have we witnessed a more   universal bitter feeling against Mormonism than at the present. Gov.   Young thinking the working bees of Utah would not take time to read  what the public press say, in relation to them and himself, set apart   Sab. June 14th at 8 a.m. to have some of the most rabid articles   read to the Saints ^in this city^, and had two of our best readers employed for the   occasion. The forenoon from 8 to 12 was nearly all taken up in   hearing the loathsome hash which the corrupt press of the U. S. has   given birth to. It was indeed novel however to hear the Governor   propose such articles to be read; seeing; they were mostly aimed at his   private and public character; but this only shows the consciousness he   possesses of the rectitude of the path which he pursues, and the confidence   he has in the people whom he leads. 
 seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much as  they have done the past winter. I hope it will continue. the power  of God has been with in preaching and teaching in all the Quorum  and Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died,  and after his death the burthen [burden] of the care of the Missionaries  rested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards; who was unwell consid-  erable but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Styde  have been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelv  (except myself) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summer  Trip North to Salmon river.    This Spring A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us about  the first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, some  missionaries will be called to Europe and to the islands. President   Young would like to send a mission to Siberia and the Japan-  ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene and  Kanosh with other chiefs, are making great improvement. Arrow-  peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, it  was good.    We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or  1200 lbs,; it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected.  a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going to  try the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.    All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory  some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southern  settlements have started on the short road, or cut off to go there  and no doubt some others will follow them soon. Your family   are all well, you and the brethren associated with you are

S. had given  birth to. It was indeed novel however to hear the Governor propose  such articles to be read; seeing they were mostly aimed at his pri-  vate and public character: this however only shews the consciousness  he possesses of the rectitude of the path which he heads, and the confidence  he has in the people whom he leads.    June 16th. Teams re-commence hauling rock for the Temple, operation  having been suspended in that department for a few days in consequen[ce]  of the church selling many of their cattle to cancel church obligations, but  the Saints having the privilege of turning in stock to help defray these   liabilities, contributed so liberally that but a few days elapsed before the  church had as many cattle as before, and not any who donated have been  hindred in their business, nor have felt any the poorer in consequence of  their liberality; and thus the Saints have witnessed to God and his ser-  vants that the Spirit of the Reformation lives in their hearts, and brings  forth fruit in their lives, and therefore Prest.

 The brethren at Salmon river have been very industrious and faithful   they have made a good fort there and sowed 120 bushels of seed   wheat this spring. The company remained at Salmon river 4 days.    Elder A. O. Smoot and Company start with the June mail,   he takes men enough along to make a mail station at Deer creek   to preserve the animals from Indian depredations.    A company of stone cutters have been sent to Big cotton   wood kanyon, to cut and prepare the rock for the Temple; from   whence it will be boated to this point, ready to lay in the building.    Geo.

 Historians office  G. S. L. City June 1 1857    Ed. of Mormon    Dr Sir,    The May mail which left Independence on the   1st, arrived here on the afternoon of the 29th Ulto. conducted by   John Murdock and O. P. Rockwell; bringing all the mail matter left   on the way since last November.    Hons. Geo. A. Smith, J. M. Bernhisel and Elder Truman O.   Angel arrived with the mail in good health and spirits; notwithstanding  the fatigues of the journey, which was rendered very laborious on account   of the scarcity, and in some parts almost entire absence of feed on  the route.    The weather was cold during the fore part of last month  with occasional showers which mostly fell on the mountains around the   valley. The frost on the morning of May 9 killed the Beans, Potatoe vines   and injured the fruit blosoms: the latter part of May has been very   [war]m and dry.    The water is abundant: water sects in the city are full and   overflowing.    Crops are very promising throughout the Territory.    During the absence of Prest. Young and company North, the   News has been ably edited by Judge Elias Smith, from which you will  learn of the prosecution and completion of much public improvement   in and around the Temple block, Council house and Governors residence.   The same spirit of public improvement is manifested through the city;   and in many places throughout the Territory.    May 26 Gov.

 G. S. L. city May 1 1857    Editor of the Mormon  Dear Sir,    The weather for the past month has been  very dry, and generally warm. The health of the inhabitants of  the city is excellent.    The past conference was very interesting. The teachings of the   First Presidency were appropriate and seasonable: 33 missionaries were   sent to Europe, 22 to Canada, 13 to the Sandwich Isles, 11 to the   U. S., and 2 to California.    A great many have been called to go on the road between   here and the States; some to make settlements, others to engage   in the service of the Express and carrying coy.    Quite a number have left these vallies, and are returning   to the States, and others to California.    Since the arrival of bros Ellsworth and McArthur last fall   with the hand cart companys, hand carts have become popular; inso-  much that the Missionaries for Europe Canada and the States have   substituted the hand carts, and are now travelling en route for the   states by that method of conveyance: 23rd. Ulto. was the day   appointed for their starting, which created an unparralleled excite-  ment in the starting of Missionaries from these vallies. Appropriate   addresses were delivered by Elders Hyde, Woodruff, L. Snow & others: 
 remission of their sins.    President Grant has gone into the North counties,  and is preaching and baptizing whole wards, and building  up Churches. I presume the same course will be pursued  in the wards in this city. The people begin to feel more  than ever that they are dealing with the spirit and power of  God, and the Holy Priesthood. Yes the Latter Day Saints  begin to feel that they are dealing with a spirit that can   reach the hearts, know the thoughts and intents thereof, and  try the souls of men. The people are called to sanctify  themselves before the Lord, that we may be prepared for the  work of our God.    Elder P. P. Pratt, in company with the Eastern Missionaries  Started on the 10th inst.    We are making great preparations for our Home Manufacturing  and Agricultural State fair, which is to be held in the Deseret Store.  The awarding committees occupy it tomorrow to award premiums,  after which it will be open to the public. It would do your soul good  to walk through the building and see the products of Utah which  are there gathered together; it is certainly far beyond my expectation.  A full account will be published oin the Deseret News.    The California Mail arrived to day: I received a letter from  Elder C. C. Rich, of San Bernardinoâall well in that place.    We are having a favorable fall for all kinds of labor, except  it is dryâwe need rain.    Oure early frosts damaged late corn very much. Some are  sowing their fall wheat. Wheat is again selling from $1 to $1.50  per bushel, notwithstanding we have just passed through a famine.    Your family, and the families of all our brethren in England  are well so far as I know.    Remember me to Elder Benson and all our friends. Yours truly,  W Woodruff 
 been called to make settlements between here and the States, and to   engage in the express coy.    Quite a number have left and are leaving this Spring for   California and the U. S. amongst the number are Judge Stiles and   T. S. Williams.    The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society have   published their lists of Premiums for the year 1857 amounting to   $1470, 253 Diplomas and 5 silver medals: this will be a great   incentive to home Manufacturers, Stock raisers, Farmers, Mechanics &c,   and tend to facilitate our commercial independence.    April 25 The Missionaries for Europe, Canada, and the   States started with their hand carts; it was a soul inspiring sight  and called forth more interest among the citizens, than the starting   of any missionaries from these vallies. Elders Hyde, Woodruff, L.  Snow and others addressed the missionaries and the concourse assembled  on the occasion    24th. A little before sun up Prests. Young, Kimball  & Wells started up for Salmon river on their northern trip, and   during the day, the company mostly left the city.    yours truly   W. Woodruff 
 June 16th. Teams re-commence hauling rock for the Temple, operations   having been suspended in that department for a few days in consequence   of the church selling many of their cattle to cancel P. E. Fund obligations &c  but the Saints having the privilege of turning in stock to help defray these   liabilities, contributed so liberally that but a few days elapsed before the   church had as many cattle as before, and not any who donated have   been hindred in their business, nor have felt any the poorer in consequence   of their liberality; and thus the Saints have witnessed to God and his   servants that the spirit of the Reformation still lives in their hearts, and   brings forth fruit in their lives, and therefore Prest. Young frequently of late   has said this is a "God blessed people."    The Eastern June mail arrived on the 23rdâ23 days from   Independenceâthe shortest trip ever made by the mail; by which   Elders Ferramore Little and Ephraim Hanks arrived. This mail brought   us several papers containing an account of the massacre of Elder P. P. Pratt.    June 27th. The Nauvoo Legion held a general muster in the   Great Salt Lake, and San Pete military districts, entered into a new organ-  ization, in consonance with the late enactments of the Legislature. It is   perhaps worthy of note that this new organization was entered into on   the 27th June the day on which the Prophets were massacred in Carthage   Jail 13 years ago.    Crops are abundant, harvest is about to commence in this   county, and the harvest being so great it will truly be an applicable  saying in a few days "the laborers are few."    Love to br. Benson ^appleby^ and all the Elders of my acquaintance   associated with you.    W. Woodruff 
 G. S. L. City 30 Sep. 1856    Editor of the Mormon    Dr Sir,    The hand cart company's of Saints under  Elders Ed. Ellsworth and D. D. McArthur arrived here on the  evening of Friday Sep. 26 Inst. having been about 9 weeks from Florence,  to this point; the few ox teams and wagons they had along, retarded  their progress considerably, not being able to keep up with them.    Prests. B. Young, and H. C. Kimball with a detachment of Lancers,   the Brass band, and many citizens went up into the Kanyon to  meet the companies.  The feelings which the Brethren had on meeting  them I will not attempt to pourtray, to behold a company of men  women and children amounting to nearly 500 souls, drawing 486 100 hand  carts, entering into the city of Great Salt Lake, dancing with joy as  they passed along, only complaining that they had been encumbered with  a few ox teams for which they had to wait several hours almost  daily, otherwise they would have been with us ten days sooner, and  then to realize that this company had walked some 1400 miles,  drawing their hand carts the whole distance; these things presented  to our eyes, at the same time reflecting upon the future resultsâ filled  our hearts with joy unspeakable, and caused our bosoms to swell   with thanksgiving to God. we felt that the flood gate of deliverance  was hoisted to the oppressed millions, and we could say in confidence  to the poor and honest in heart "come home to Zion," for the way is  opened up. Prest. Kimball said his heart felt as big as a two bushel  basket, yes our hearts were so swollen that we were speechless not  with sorrow, but with joy. Elders Ellsworth and McArthur have  earned honor and glory to themselves in the leading of these companies 
 otherwise pleasant journey: remained with the settlement at Salmon   river 4 days where the brethren have made much improvement, and   have sown 120 Bushels of seed Wheat this spring.    Elder A. O. Smoot and Company start with the June mail,   he takes men enough along to make a mail station at Deer Creek,   to preserve the animals from Indian depredations. Several companies  have gone out this spring to make mail stations on the route.    Many teams are constantly engaged hauling rock for the Temple   and a company of stone cutters have been sent to Big Cotton wood  kanyon, to cut the rock preparatory to boating it for this point.    The health of the inhabitants of the Territory is excellent;   and, since the opening spring has washed away with the tide   of emigration, many of the half hearted Saints; the moral elements   feel considerably clearer.    Geo. A. has just stepped in, and hearing we were writing to   you says tell the Editor I am glad to be at home and have the   privilege of walking our streets once more.    yours truly   W. Woodruff 
 Historian's office  G. S. L. City Oct. 4, 1856    Ed. of the Western Standard    Dear Sir,   The california mail arrived on the 29th Ulto.   by which we are in receipt of a full file of the Standard for August.    We are now in the midst of emigration. Elder Bank's  company from St. Louis, and Elder Bunker's hand cart companies  have arrived this week.    On the 26th Ulto. the hand cart company's of Elders Edmund  Ellsworth and D. D. McArthur arrived with about 100 hand carts and 486  souls. The kindly welcome and benevolent reception these Pioneer hand cart  companies received exceeded greatly that of any other company since our ar-  rival in the mountains.    On 20th Sep. Ulto Elder Peterson's company of Danes arrived.    Elder Preston Thomas arrived from Texas on the evening of  12th inst. in advance of his company which arrived on the 16th    The health of the people generally is firstrate.    The Weather has been very fine this last month, which has been  very favorable for public improvements.    The Deseret State Fair closes to day. This has been a   display of talent genius and industry which does honor to our citizens,  indeed we feel proud of our associations with a people, who altho' hem-  med in by mountains living on desert plains, accounted unworthy the  abode of civilization, have made mother earth team luxuriantly with  the comfortsâthe bountiesâyea the luxuries of life, and we can indorse  the sentiment of the Prophet, when he declared the desert should  blossom as the rose [##Isaiah 35:1##], and the barren waste should be converted into  a fruitful field [##Isaiah 32:15##].    On the 10th Ulto we moved into the new Historian office 
 the lands and a large concourse of citizens conveyed them on to   the bench and witnessed their departure. The Presidency organized   them towards the mouth of the kanyon.    April 24th. Gov. Young, Hon. H. C. Kimball & Gen.   D. H. Wells started before sunrise, and the balance of the company   during the day on their tour to Salmon river and the Northern   country.    The Sabbath school children from the various wards organ-  ized for a May walk this morning, and promenaded on the bench,   and in city creek kanyon, gathering flowers and branches with green   foliage, under the superintendence of their respective Directors; and  about 2 p. m, met in the 14th Ward, where they formed a line   and with their appropriate banners and devices, walked through the   principal streets and pasted the Governors residence, then proceeded to   the Tabernacle at 4 where their parents were invited and I delivered   them an address. The brass band accompanied them, and with their   soul inspiring music added interest to the interesting spectacle.    yours truly    W. Woodruff

City May 5 1857    Ed. of Western Standard    Dear Sir,    The California Mail arrived on the 2nd  inst., bringing files of the Standard, which as usual is very interesting.    During the 6, 7, 8 & 9 days of the past month we held our 27th  annual conference, which has been a very interesting and important oc-  casion. There were 33 Missionaries appointed to Europe, 22 to Canada   13 to the Sandwich isles, 11 to the U. S., and 2 to Calafornia.    We were favored with rich teachings from the First Presidency.   The objects and interests of the Express and Carrying Company were   laid before the people; showing the advantages that would accrue to   gathering Israel when a high way was cast up, settlements made   at every feasable point, and a thoroughfare established so that the   Saints could come home. The necessity of laying up grain against   the days of famine and want was urged upon the Saints.    Thirty four brethren were selected this spring to make a settle-  ment on the Rio Virgin for raising cotton; and over one hundred   have been called to make settlements between here and the States,   and to engage in the Express Coy.    Judge Styles, T. S. Williams and many others are leaving this   spring for the States, not being able to find out here, whether mormon-  ism is true or not.    The weather for the past month has been very dry, still   crops are looking well; Dews are becoming more prevalent in this country.    april 23rdâThe missionaries for Europe, Canada and the   States started with hand carts, as another ensample to the Saints scat-  tered abroad of the feasibility of that method of gathering: there was 
 Historian's office  G. S. L. City Nov 5, 1856    Ed. of the Western Standard    Dear Brother  The Weather has been very cold and some-  what stormy for the past month, but at the present more open & mild.    On the arrival of Elders D. Spencer, F. D. Richards and company  at this place, Prest. Young learned the exact situation of the Emigration,  at the dates the brethren passed the several camps; and although much  help in Teams and Flour had been sent out early in the season,  the President made it the first item of business before the conference to  raise Flour, Teams, Wagons, Teamsters, Blankets and clothing to send  to them: to this call there was a very liberal response. Subsequent calls  have been made, and it is now believed there has in the neighborhood  of 250 Teams gone out, and at the conference call alone there was  26,688 lbs of flour sent, so you perceive this seasons emigration  comes tolerably heavy on those of our brethren who are always on hand  to help Israel.    The best news from this place is the reformation which  is abroad in the Territory. you may consider that reformation is no  new thing in Israel, that as a people we have always been reforming   or trying to do so; but let me assure you that reformation has  began in solemn earnest. The humble and faithful are waking up,  repenting of their sins, making restitution where they have wronged,  and preparing for the waters of baptism determined from henceforth  in the strength of Israels God to serve him, and keep his command  ments. The reformation is the all absorbing topic here to those who  want to do right, and as a matter of course the greatest thorn  to those who do not, that has yet troubled them in Israel. 
 G. S. L. City April 1 1857    Messrs. Wm. R. Prince & Co[mpan]y.   Gents    The last Nov. Eastern mail arrived in this  city on the 24th. Ulto.; having wintered in the snow at Devils gate:  it brought me your note of Oct. 18th. I have not heard from  any mail since the 1st. of Nov. When the mail of the winter months  arrive I shall expect to receive the fruit cuttings sent for, which I am   anxiously looking for. I have requested Hon. J. M. Bernhisel to   forward you $5. for a few of the Dioscorea Batatas as a trial; if  you obtain the order please send them to my address. I would like  to obtain a genuine article of Hovey seedling strawberries accompanied  with a suitable staminate.    Your letter having been detained until so late a date I have  but a few seeds of any kind on hand which will be of value to you  I enclose a few seeds of the Mesquite and Muskroo from the Rio Virgin  and Santa Clara. the coarse seeds are Mesquite, the fine Muskroo, it forms  an ornamental tree some 20 feet high. I could not give information  whether the proper time of sowing should be Spring or Fall. I also  enclose a few service berries where the bush is calculated it produces  two crops each season.    During the summer I will dry carefully some of our best  mountain currants of each kind & service berry and forward to you, or  any other native seeds which I think may be of any worth to you. some  of our native currants bear a remarkable good berry both for size and  flavor as large as the English black cherry. I am satisfied that  Utah will prove a good fruit growing country. Aprictots and Peaches 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF was   the next speaker. He alluded to the   departure from the true order of the   gospel by professing Christians. It was   almost impossible for them to believe  that continued revelation from the Al-  mighty was necessary. The faith of   the Latter-day Saints, however, was   that it is God's right to rule and dictate   by revelation. The law of tithing was   given by revelation, and no Saint could   neglect to comply with it and retain   the spirit of the gospel. It was the   duty of all to assist in building temples  in which to attend to ordinance per-  taining to the living and the dead.   None of the requirements of the gospel  would fall to the ground, for all must   be fulfilled. The speaker exhorted the   people to draw near to the Lord, that   he might draw near to them, and that   they might be filled with the light of   truth. He also bore testimony to the   greatness and the divine nature of the   latter-day work. 
 ELDER W. WOODRUFF said: I  met in this house when it was dedi-  cated to the Lord and I was very glad  to see a house built after the Prysby-  terian style, filled by prophets and   apostles; it being the first that was built  by the Latter-day Saints; I feel so to-  day to meet with so many of the Saints  to worship the Lord our God; I have  listened with a great deal of attention  to the teachings of yesterday by the   servants of God; for a long time I have  thought and asked myself the question  where are the Saints drifting to; I saw   and realized that a change was neces-  sary to save the people; I have medit-  ated upon the condition of our country  and of our nation that is fast going  down, therefore the Lord is calling  upon his people to unite, and you and  I live in the dispensation of the fullness  of times; it is the greatest that has ever   been upon the earth, for it will gather  all things into one and the principles  that have been laid before you by  brother Snow and Cannon will prepare  the hearts of people to receive the truth  and prepare the way for the coming of   the Son of Man; what did the world   know about the gospel of Jesus Christ  for the last 1,700 years, until God called  Joseph Smith in his youth, raised him  up and educated and prepared him to  lay the foundation of this great and   mighty work, and offer to the world  truth, the principles of life and salva-  tion; Luther and others were called to  introduce principles of liberty and they  done good work for many years, and  in process of time Columbus discover-  ed America, and our puritan forefa-  thers who came over in the Mayflower,  and the Declaration of Independence  and the Constitution that was framed   by our forefathers when they met in  Philadelphia; we acknowledge that   the hand of God was in all this to pre-  pare the way for the gospel, and Jo-  seph Smith was inspired of God and  we are well acquainted with him, we  have traveled with him, eat and slept  with him and knew him well, and   know what he passed through and en-  dured until his blood was shed; Jo-  seph lived long enough to establish  this work and before his death he com-  mitted the keys of the kingdom to his  brethren, and he has gone to preach to  the spirits in prison that have died  since the days of Jesus and his Apos-  tles, and he has organized the church  there the same as he did here. Pres-  ident Young has brought us here  where no marks had been made by any  of the Anglo-Saxon race after we were  driven from our homes; we as Latter-  day Saints have got to unite and do the   will of the Lord, build temples to his  holy name and receive the blessings of  the Lord and assist in the fulfillment  of the revelations of God, for Babylon  is nearly ripe for destruction, for God  will cut his work short in righteous-  ness; the nation has rejected this work  as a general thing; this is the work of   God and He will defend his people;  the revelations say, woe to that people   or nation that shall lift up their arms   against the Lord's anointed, for they   will be destroyed, and on whomsoever  the little stone that was cut out of the   mountain without hands shall fall  upon it will grind them to powder.  Let us unite for the defense of Zion,  for it is worth more than we possess to  gain eternal life; let us remember Geo.  Q. Cannon, who is in the halls of Con-  gress in Washington, in our prayers,  that God may sustain him, and if the  saints unite and be faithful we shall  come off triumphant from this time  henceforth and forever, which may   God grant for Christ's sake, amen. 
 they have like the people walked all the way and assisted in   drawing the hand carts. Brother Ellsworth went through the city  covered with dust at the head of his brave company drawing a  hand cart, under the close scrutiny of the thousands who crowded  the streets with weeping eyes to gaze upon the scene; as he passed  by his own lovely home and saw his wives and children standing in his door  he made no halt, only gave a passing salute, continuing with his company  until he reached the public square and saw them all comfortably encamped   and fed. I felt that his position was far more honorable and lovely  in the eyes of God and Angels and good men, than it would have  been had he been mounted upon the best steed that ever had the  earth clothed with ermine and gold. Prest. Young has declared from  the beginning that it was a practical safe operation his sayings in  this, as in all other cases have proven here, he lost but seven out of his  company a smaller number than almost any company that have arrived here  containing as many souls. Many were aged and infirm, yet they out-travelled  any ox teams that could be started on the road; never has a company  been so highly honored, so numerously worked, or so kindly dealt with  since Israel has arrived in these mountains, as the Pioneer hand cart  companies.    The Deseret State Fair is opened for the reception of articles for  exhibition, and from the universal spirit of encouragement to domestic  manufactures, we anticipate our Fair will be an emporium of Utah's true  wealth which will astonish her own citizens, further particulars by next  mail.    There is a reformation commenced here among this people by  the authorities of the church, such an one as we trust will be 
 The first speaker was  APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF.    "We are again called to assemble  here to pay our last respects to one   of God's noblemen. We have lying  before us the tabernacle of President   Joseph Young. It is said that he is  dead. I suppose he is as we use the  term death. His tabernacle lies   here in this casket, but Uncle Jo-  seph is not there! We call him   "Uncle" because he has been related   to almost all the Holy Priesthood of   Israel from the organization  of this Church. I ask Brother  Lorenzo Young and Bro. Young's   wives and his sons and daughters, if   they feel to mourn in their hearts  to-day? If they do, I do not; if they   do, President Joseph Young does   not; for it was one of the most glo-  rious moments of his existence, whe-  ther in time or in eternity, when he  opened his eyes in the spirit world   and struck hands with Joseph   Smith, with Brigham Young, with   his father's house, and with the El-  ders of Israel with whom he has  been associated here on the earth  more or less for the last 50 ye[a]rs of  his life. If Bro. Joseph ever felt   while in the flesh to shout, glory,   hallelujah! he did so when this new  birth took place. Now these are   some of the sentiments of my  heart. I cannot mourn when I fol-  low to the grave a man like Joseph   Young; I have never been able to do  it since I have been a member of  the Church, when I havo followed a   true, faithful, Latter-day Saint  to the grave. Death was a gloomy   subject to me before I heard the   gospel of Jesus Christ. It was sad  to see the bodies of men and women  laid away in the tomb. I did not  know where they came from,   why they were here, where   they were going. It was taking, as   it were, a leap in the dark. But,   thank God, the blood of Christ  has burst the bonds of death, given   us power in the resurrection, and  the gospel of Jesus Christ has point-  ed out to us the blessings, the glory   and the privileges that we can en-  joy in this world and in the world  to come. Death has lost its gloom   with me, with the Latter-day Saints.  I do not know whether the spirit of   Brother Joseph is watching over us   to-day, seeing this funeral, hearing   us talk upon this subject, or whether  in the eternal world his joy is so  great that he will say in his own  mind to those that are left be-  hind, "bury my body, I have   got something else to do."  I do not know that this is the case,  God has not revealed it to me; but   one thing I can say from the very   depth of my heart, and that is, I   rejoice and thank God that I had  the privilege of becoming acquaint-  ed with such a man as President   Joseph Young and of being associat-  ed with him in the flesh for nearly  50 years. His life is before me and  you, it has been before the heavens   and the earth. A purer man, a  more virtuous man, a more honest  man, according to the light and   knowledge God bestowed upon him,  I do not know that we have in our   midst. "Blessed are the dead that  die in the Lord, yea, saith the Spirit  from henceforth, for they rest from  their labors and their works do fol-  low them." We have death here  in this world. We attend funerals;  our friends, our fathers, our moth-  ers, our brethren, our sisters,   our children die; we mourn over   them in a measure; we follow them  to the grave; but do you compre-  hend and understand that when we   have such a death as this here,  there is a birth on the other side of the  vail? Don't you think that Sarah,   when she received Isaac, rejoiced at  the birth of her son? [##Genesis 21:1-7##] Yes, she did,  and so have all the mothers in  Israel who comprehend the value of  offspring. Now, whether there was   any mourning in the spirit world  when Isaac left, I do not know. I   should think not, for those there  would fully comprehend the value   of spirits taking tabernacles on the  earth. But here we have a death,  a funeral. Well, if you could see the   vail lifted up, and behold Uncle Jo-  seph, the old patriarch, who has  lived 84 years in the flesh, and more  than half of his life in the  Church and Kingdom of God,  do you think you would see much   mourning there? No you would   not. Brother Joseph Young is re-  joicing with Brother Joseph Smith  and his brethren the Elders of Israel,  and we certainly should rejoice on  this occasion, when we are paying  our respects to a man that has been  faithful during these great many  years, faithful to his God, faithful   to his family, faithful to his quo-  rum, faithful to the Church and  kingdom of God and to his coven-    ants. Brother Joseph has finished   his work here in the flesh and gone   into the presence of God and the   Lamb, and we have the hope and   consolation that this man will in-  herit eternal life and come forth in   the morning of the first resurrection.   That same tabernacle which Uncle   Joseph has occupied for over 84 years   will come forth again, and he will   be crowned with principalities and  powers, and be made an heir of God   and joint heir with Jesus Christ to   all the blessings that God himself   possesses. Can you mourn? I can-  not. I wish I might live as good a  life and receive as good a glory and   exaltation as I am satisfied Brother  Joseph Young will obtain. He has   lived to a great age. My first ac-  quaintance with him was in 1834, in   Kirtland. I traveled with him in   Zion's Camp a thousand miles, led   by President Joseph Smith; with   Brother Brigham and many others  from whom the Lord afterwards  chose the first quoroum of the Twelve  Apostles, of whom Brother Pratt   and myself are the only ones   now alive. I always rejoiced in   the society of Brother Young. He   is from a noble family, and perhaps  it is my duty here to say something   with regard to his father. I made a   remark in some of my public dis-  courses that Father Joseph Smith   was the first Patriarch ordained in   this Church and Kingdom. I   should have been more explicit in   this matter. The father of Joseph   Young and Brigham Young was   the first ordained Patriarch in this   generation, but he was ordained as   Patriarch of his own family, he did   not officiate as the Patriarch of   the Church, as Father Joseph Smith   did up to the day of his death. I   wished to make these remarks be-  cause I consider they are just and  right.    Well, now, what shall I say to you   with regard to Bro. Joseph Young?    You are acquainted with him,   he has been in your midst. He was   ordained the First President of the   Seventies in 1835. He has held that   office from that time up to the day   of his death, and he will hold that   position and the keys of that posi-  tion after death and after the resur-  rection. Not only so, but he will   occupy a place as a king and priest  to the Most High God, ruling and   reigning in the house of Israel   forever.    I want to say to the sons and   daughters of Brother Joseph Young,   follow your father as he has follow-  ed Christ and you will rejoice in   the eternal worlds with him. He   has been a good father to you, a   good husband, and a good counselor  not only to his family but to the   Church and Kingdom of God. He   has been associated with these seven  Presidents of the first quorum   of Seventies. There are but few of   those living to-day, and are here   remaining who were ordained the   same time that he was. He was or-  dained a Patriarch under the hands   and direction of his brother Brig-  ham in the Endowment House a   few years go. He has held that   office from that day to this; and his   tabernacle will lie in the tomb but a   very short time until it will   burst the bonds of death and   come forth out of the grave,   and that spirit that to day   is rejoicing in the spirit world will   again return to the same house. I   am glad of that. I rejoice in that   principle that we can again have  our bodies in which we have traveled  on foot, without money and without   reward, for many thousands of miles  to preach the gospel, in which we   have labored in weariness and hun-  [g]er and thirst to perform this labor.   Now this is a great conso-  lation to me that this same   house that our spirits dwell in to-  day, we can have in the morning of   the resurrection. This will be the   case with Prest. Joseph Young, who   lies here before us to-day. I was   very much pleased in looking upon   his face, so natural, so pleasant, so   life-like in one sense of the word, it   looks as though he went to sleep and   was happy. His tabernacle shows,   as it were, the happiness of his spirit   when it departed.    Brother Joseph's history has been   of interest to us. He has magnified   his calling, he has been true and   faithful in all his days. Before he   was a member of this Church he   was a Methodist preacher. He   taught the gospel according to the   best light and knowledge he had.   But when he had the Gospel carried   to him by his brother, he embraced   it, and it is said he never laughed in   his life until he embraced our   religion. When he was a Metho-  dist preacher he was always gloomy   and sober, very seldom smiled, but   when he embraced the true gospel    it is said he laughed for six months,  he was so overjoyed to think tha[upside-down text]t[end of upside-down text]  he had found out the truth. Well,   I will promise you he is happy to-  day, and he will see no more sorrow.    I rejoice when I see a man who is   true and faithful to the gospel, to   the Priesthood, to his calling and   covenants before God, I can tell you   the heavens rejoice over him, the   angels rejoice over him, and why   should not we?    I am pleased to have the privilege   of making a few remarks on this oc-  casion. I do not, however, wish to   detain you, as there are others of my   brethren who will speak. But I   thank God that we have the privi-  lege of paying our last respects to   our departed brother. His body will  now be laid away in the tomb, but   by and by it will come forth and be   glorified.    I pray God my Eternal Father   to let his blessing rest upon   us; that his spirit may rest upon   Bro. Lorenzo, and upon the wives,   sons and daughters and friends of   the deceased; that we may all of us   take the admonitionâfor all these   things are admonitions, to live   faithful like unto our departed   brother for "the night will come   when no man can work." I have a   desire myself to do good. I cannot   remain here long. Many of my   brethren have gone henceâBrigham   Young, Heber C. Kimball,   Orson Hyde, George A. Smith,   P. P. Pratt, and now President Jo-  seph Young. Many of my brethren  who went with that Camp have  gone henceâBrigham Young, He-  ber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, George  A. Smith, Parley P. Pratt, and  now President Joseph Young.  And there are but few of us left.    How long we shall tarry here,   I do not know, but while I   live I want to do what good I can.    I tell you it is a glorious blessing for   men to receive the Priesthood of  God, and to be called of God to  preach the gospel. The old pro-  phets and patriarchs are watching   over us. They are anxious to see us   perform our work. Brother Joseph   came to me a few weeks since and   talked about his death. He wanted   to finish up his records before he   left. He wished to do what he could   for his dead while he was in the   flesh. Well, I told him I rejoiced   that he was looking after these   things. But now, if he has left any-  thing undone, his brother Lorenzo   or his family will attend to the   matter, as we have all got to do   what we can to save both the living   and the dead.    May God bless us all, and give us  power to finish our work, to be true   and faithful unto death, that we   may gain eternal life, is my prayer,   in the name of Jesus, Amen. 
 Apostle Woodruff said, it is im-  portant that the Saints should know  the position they occupy, and their   future destiny. Read from the rev-  elation called "##Doctrine and Covenants 76|The Vision##," also the  ##Revelation 5|5th chapter## of John's revelations.  Said that the Savior while on earth  was very poor, as far as the wealth   of the world was concerned, as an   evidence, when called upon to pay   [t]axes, he had to send Peter to catch  a fish, from which to obtain the   money. No man who ever lived   can say he descended lower than the   Savior did. Spoke upon the variety   that is seen upon the earth and   among men, showing that each has  his own identity, which he will re-  tain to all eternity, and that God in   all dispensations has had spirits upon  the earth to work with. If the eyes   of the Elders were opened they   would never set their hearts upon   the things of this world. We sh[a]ll   build these Temples because God   has decreed it. The Savior is watch-  ing over us and will continue to do   so until his second coming. Go[d]  has decreed that Zion shall not be   moved out of her place, but if   we transgress we shall be chastised.    Wished to say to the young it is their  duty to get married, but not to get   themselves into a condition to be   obliged to marry or they would reap   sorrow. The spirits that have been   reserved will be born in spite of all   the laws to the contrary. Said that   Zion would never go backward, and  the curse of God would rest upon   those who apostatize after having   partaken of the blessings promised.  Those of the daughters of Zion who   have been legally married have a   right to bear the souls of men, and   though they know it not, many of   the rising generation will never   taste death, but will be changed in a  moment. It will require great faith   to stand in the midst of the judg-  ments of God. 
 quite an excitement in the city on the occasion: large crowds of  citizens assembled to see them start: Elders Hyde, Woodruff, L. Snow &  Claiton addressed the people & the Missionaries: the brass band   escorted them through the city.    april 24âThe Presidency & Coy. for Salmon river and   the Northern Settlements started.    The Sabbath school children had a may day walk on the   1st inst.âpromenaded through the streets, and at 4 p.m. met in   the Tabernacle, where there parents were also invited. I had the   pleasure of delivering them an address, & felt the occasion and felt it   was one of no ordinary character,  I understand the address appears in   the News.     All is quiet, peace and health, in our Territory so far   as I know.    yours truly,   W. Woodruff

 PRESIDENT W. WOODRUFF re-  ferred to the present prosperous cir-  cumstances of the people, as com-  pared with those which surrounded  them immediately after the settle-  ment of these valleys. He observed  with interest and satisfaction the in-  crease of the population and settle-  ments throughout the Territory.  Zion was being rapidly built up. It  should be remembered however that  the angels and our dead are watching   us and our labors. The speaker had  a great anxiety to see the Latter-day  Saints manifest to their works a de-  sire to build up the Kingdom of God   in view of fulfilling all that had been   spoken and written to reference to  the redemption of the living and the  dead. He referred to the progress  being made in the building of the  Salt Lake temple, and observed that   it would, at the rate of progress now  being made, be three years yet be-  fore the walls were built to the  square. It should be remembered,  he said, by the Saints that their ob-  ject in coming here was not to make  themselves rich in the things of the  world, but to build up the Lord's   Kingdom. He admonished all to  obey the commandments of God,   and then we shall satisfy ourselves,  our Father in Heaven, and our  friends in the spirit world with the  work we have performed on the   earth. The speaker prayed that the   spirit of the Lord might rest upon  the congregations assembled during  this Conference, so that the servants   of the Lord would be able to profitably  instruct those who came to hear. 
 On the 31st October, brother Gideon D. Gibbs and Horace  Newell arrived from Elder Willie's hand cart Coy., whom they left on  the sweetwater, when the teams sent out at Conference arrived at  this camp, there had been twenty deaths, nineteen of them men.  and while with them in one day there were fifteen burials, and when  the messengers left there had been fifty deaths. They did not seem  to be sick, but chilled through, men would dig graves for their  brethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed   their last rations of Flour the night before the brethren met them  and they did not know that any relief was at hand.    The reason of this difficulty and suffering [ink faded] with the  emigration is in consequence of the companies starting so late, and   the early falling of snow in the mountains. Prest. Young has  universally given counsel for the emigration to start early.    The hand cart companies who started early came in well indeed  better than the most sanguine could have expected.    yours truly.  W. Woodruff 
 permanent. The preaching of the First Presidency has been soul  tirring indeed. We may safely say in a measure that such sermons  were never heard before, as have been delivered unto us of late by the  prophet of God, and they are weighing the people, and the people feel  that they are dealing with the quickening spirit and power of  God which discerns and knows their hearts and they feel the importance  of repentance and baptism for the remission of sins and leading holy  lives before God that we may be prepared for the events which await  the whole earth. In some of the settlements in Davis County every  one has gone forward and been re-baptized, and we anticipate the  same results will follow in G. S. L. County.    Sep 20. Elder Peterson's company of Danes arrived.    Elder S. M. Blair and company returned from exploring a  route to Carson valley, report no feasible route westward. Hon. E. Reese  arrived from Carson with the same report.    The weather has continued fine and must of the corn not  injured by early Frosts will have time to mature.    On the 10th inst we moved into our new office opposite  Prest. Youngs buildings, and have much cause to be thankful for  the superior accommodations we enjoy.    yours truly  W. Woodruff 
 opposite Prest. Young's buildings.    On the 29th. Ult we had a general muster and inspection  of the Nauvoo Legion. Lieut. Gen. Wells and his staff received the  troops, after which a hollow square was formed and the Lieut. Gen.   delivered an animating address to the troops, which was well sustained  by the officers of his staff and chaplain.    We have had much excellent preaching lately by the First  Presidency and others. Prest. Young has come out boldly and told this  people in the name of the Lord, they must repent and be baptized  for the remission of their sins. Several Wards have gone forward  en masse been baptized and recieved their covenants before the Lord,  and I believe the fire of a universal reformation in this Territory  has been lit and will continue to burn, until a permanent  foundation for good works has been laid in our midst.

 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF.    President Woodruff said: The taber-  nacle of our dear beloved brother,  pioneer, father and patriarch, Lorenzo  D. Young lies before us today. We   have met together to pay our respects  to it, and to bury this our friend in the   earth, to lay his body in the tomb to  rest until the time of the resurrection.  But Brother Young's spirit is free.  Whether he is here attending the   funeral of his body or not I do not   koow; that is something that is not  revealed to me. But I will say that  with the knowledge I have of the   Gospel of Christ I have never been  able, since I have been acquainted  with the principles of the Gospel, to  mourn in my heart and my spirit over  any faithful Latter-day Saint who had  died and departed this life. This may  seem strange, and sometimes I   have thought that perhaps I have   offended some of my friends  in expressing myself with regard to  these things. Until I heard the  Gospel, death was a most gloomy thing  to me. In my early youth I attended   funerals. I looked upon the dead  body; I saw it placed in the tomb,  covered up in the earth, and it was a   very gloomy matter to me. I did not  know where the spirit of that body was  going to. I did not know what its  destiny was. But when I became ac-  quainted with the Gospel of Christ  these things were all clear to my mind;  and from that day to this I have never  been able to mourn over anybody,  prophets or apostles, fathers, mothers,  brothers, sisters, or any of the Saints of  God who have dwelt in the flesh and  kept the celestial law of God and  qualified themselves to enter into the

President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City  Dear. Brother:    Yours of a recent date to hand and  duly considered. In reply will say, that am indeed grateful at  being considered worthy of such an honorable calling, and trust  that by the grace of our Heavenly Father I may be enabled to go  forth and accomplish the purpose for which have been called.  So if nothing happens to prevent further than know of at present  I shall be at your office on date specified. I am    Your Brother in the Gospel  Julian F. Smith    F. H. Wright Bp 
 celestial kingdom of our God. There  is something about it that takes away  this feeling of mourning and death  from me.    I have been associated with Brother  Young for sixty years of my life. He  came with us here in our pioneer   journey. He has been with us from  that day till this. He has livd and  labored with us, and as far as I know  fulfilled every duty that has been re-  quired at his hands. I believe he is   the last of the family. One reason  why I cannot mourn over Brother  Youngâand it will apply to all the  faithful Saintsâis this: when a man  has dwelt in the flesh, has obeyed the  Gospel of Christ, has recieved the  ordinances of the house of God per-  taining to the Holy Priesthood, and  perpared himself so that when the  spirit leaves his body he can enter  into the presence of God or into the  presence of the righteous, and pre-  pared also to have a place in the first   resurrectionâwhen a man of this kind  passes away I cannot mourn  over him. And that I view as   the condition of Brother Lorenzo  Young today. I believe that   he is mingling with his father's  house, with his brothers, and perhaps  with the Prophet Joseph; and if the  veil was take from our faces and we   could see and comprehend the position   of Brother Young today, none of us  could mourn.    I visited Brother Young several  times before his death. The last time  but one I visited him I felt impressed  to lay my hands upon his head and   bless him, and I did. I blessed him as  far as I had power to bless anybody in   the earth. He has been a man I   thought a great deal of, because of his  truth, of his goodness, of his gener-  osity and of the feeling and spirit of  God that has been with him all his  life, as far as I have been acquainted  wtih him.    I do not wish to detain the congra  gation; but there is one sentiment I   wish to utter. If I had power to de-  cide the destiny of the children of men,  I would like to decree that every  son and daughter of the old  Patriarch, Father John Young,  the father of Brother Lorenzo  Young, and all the descendants of  Father John Young, Brigham Young,  Jospeh Young, Phineus Young and   Lorenzo YoungâI say I would like to  decree if I had the power that the pos-  terity of these men should follow in   their channel, whereby when they get   through they may have experience,  light, knowledge and truth, every one  of them, sufficient to prepare them to  mingle in the same society, the same  place, the same glory, the same exalta-  tion and blessings that these noble men  enjoy who have passed away. I have  been associated with the whole family.  I have traveled forty years with Presi-  dent Brigham Young, at home and  abroad. I know something of his life.   You know him. He is known to this   people. He is known to the world.  He was a great man, a good man, a   righteous man. God raised him up to   perform a great work, and he ac-  complished it all until he finished  his mission in the flesh, and  then he went home to God,  who gave him, and mingled with  the Prophets and Aposltes. If the   veil was taken off and we could com-  prehend the blessings these men enjoy,  the sting of death would pass from us.   All is right with our brother. He has   lived a good and righteous life. He  has finished his work with joy and re-  joicing, and he has passed away from   the trouble and tribulations of this   world. He will come forth in the   morning of the first resurrection,  clothed with glory, immortality and   eternal life, and dwell with the  righteous. We have to become ac-  quainted with the celestial law, with  the terrestrial law, and with the  telestial law, and the glories of which  the ancient patriarchs and prophets  spoke, and of which the Apostles Paul  spoke at some length; and it will pay  any mortal being on the face of the   earth to pursue a course whereby he   may be made a partaker of the  celestial glory and obtain the blessings  of that glory. I think sometimes  that we ourselves come far short of   comprehending our privileges and our  blessings that we enjoy here in life.    I thank God I have lived to hear the   Gospel. I thank God I have lived to  see prophets and apostles. I desired  this in my youth with every sentiment  of my heart. I have lived to see all I  desired in my heart with regard to   those things. I have spent over sixty   years of my life with prophets and  apostles. I rejoice in this. As to my-  self, I am liable any hour or any day  to occupy the same position Brother   Young does now. I have felt in my  heart that I did not want to live an  hour longer than I could live to do   some good in the earth. The Lord  has preserved my life to a good old  age. In fact, I have had to give the  Lord all the glory and honor and cre-  dit for every blessing I have ever en-  joyed. I have known for myself  that what I have recieved has been  by the power of God, and not of  man. I know these principles that  Brother Joseph F. Smith has been  reading about are true. The resur-  rection is true. We are placed here  and a mighty responsibility rests upon  us as Latter-day Saints. The Lord  has placed upon us the Holy Priest-  hood, and we are under this great re-  sponsibility of magnifying this Priest-  hood in our day and generation,  preaching the Gospel, doing good,   building up Zion, and preparing the   way for the coming of the Son of Man.   I feel to rejoice with the Saints of God;  and I hope when I get through with  my work here I will be able to meet  our brethren in spirit as well as in  the resurrection. These things are  joyful to me in my meditations. These  brethren that I have been with for a   great many years; they die, and the   spirit leaves the body. We bury them,  and of course there is a separation.   But I look forward, which we can all   do, with faith and with confidence, to   the time when we shall again mingle  with them. I believe that when  Brother Young's spirit left him he met  many friends in the spirit who were  ready to accompany him wher-  ever he had to go. To whatever   place he had to go he did not go  alone, but had friends to go with him.   His mission is finished here, and we  have to follow in our day and time.   Therefore let us all try to be faithful  and to do our duty; try to walk up-  rightly before the Lord, and labor to   overcome the temptations of the devil.   The enemy labors to draw away every  Saint of God. We have to contend   against these spirits of evil.    I pray God my Heavenly Father  that His blessings may rest upon us.  I pray that the hearts of the family   may be comforted. With regard to   our brother who is taken away, I do  not feel that they can mourn in their  spirits over Brother Lorenzo. He   lived as long as was necessary, as long  as he could do good int he flesh; and  when he passed away he finished the  labor of this probation. He was sent  here for work; he finished th[a]t work.   So have his brothers, as well as many  of the Elders of Israel, finished their  work and mission. We ourselves still  remain, and we have got our work to   finish. If we do it right, all will be  well with us. I pray God that His   blessings may be with us, that we  may all be led by the Spirit and power  of God in the paths of righteousness, of  holiness and truth, and that we may  accomplish the work assigned to us in  a way and manner that we may be jus-  tified when we have finished our work,  which is my desire in the name of  Jesus Christ. Amen.

 Joseph Weston  April 5 [18]98 
 Apostle W. Woodruff said there never   was a prophet or inspired man upon the  earth in any age who did not require  the spirit of God to teach him the  things of God, and that no quorum of  Twelve Apostles who had ever lived  upon the earth had been more united  or had done a greater work toward   building up God's kingdom than the  Twelve were now performing. He   then gave an account of his recent mis-  sion to the Saints and Lamanites in  Arizona. During a visit of nine months   among the settlements of the Saints in  that territory the speaker had not   heard a man profane the name of the  Deity, had not seen any quarrels  among neighbors, had not known of  any drinking of intoxicating liquor, nor  u[s]ing of tobacco, tea nor coffee; in fact  he had not [witnessed] the vices which  are too common in the cities and towns  of Utah. The town of St. John, Apache  county that, having been owned by  Jews and Mexicans, and as the "Mor-  mon" settlements were located around  this town, it was thought expedient to  buy the township, accordingly the pur-  chase had been made.    The tribes of Indians visited were the   Navajoes, Apache, [Haqui], and Zuni.  The two former tribes been very  wary [3 or 4 illegible words (page break)] were called by the  Elder [[illegible (page break)  The former were roving and savage  tribes, the latter lived in town and   were partly civilized. He was well   treated in all the travels among them.   The strictest attention was given to all  the preachings, and the teachings and  instructions he imparted caused a spirit  of thankfulness and rejoicing among  them. Especially was this the case  among the Zuni who were the most  intelligent and civilized of all the tribes.   through their earnest request, he con-  tinued speaking unto them for several  hour[s], whenever he would stop the  question would be asked "Do you know  any more?" and the hearer became so  overcome that they wept for joy. The   situation on the [H]aqui villages was   very picturesque, they being built upon   tables of solid rock from [500] to 1300 feet  in height with perpendicular [sides].  Here they had lived for centuries per-  haps--Tilling their farms below and   carrying the products their fuel and   their water up to their homes by   means of a circuitous [p]ath or dugway  the frequent raids of the [Warkka reing]  had driven them (the Haqui) to this  manner of living, that they might pro-  tect their lives and property without   going to war. Some of the leading men  among these tribes had said that before  the white came among them [adultery]  was not known [the term "adulterer"] such a   sin was punishable by death. In conclu-  sion, the speaker alluded to the re-  markable preservation of the Saints in  gathering from the nations of the earth,  testified to the near approach of the   Son of Man, and exhorted the Saints to  faithfulness continually.

 Pres. Wilford Woodruff, addressed the Saints and remarked  that if he had all the elders Isreal before him this afternoon  he would like to speak to them a short time and it would  be that when they get up to speak to cease making excuses,   he was displeased to hear such things, he like to hear a  man get up and speak to say what he has to say to say  it without making excuses when the elders stand up to  teach should do so by the aid and insperation of the   Holy Ghost, min^esters^ and Law^yers^ are trained to speak, He  spoke of the stamina that is required to receive and   live up to the truth, because of the unpopularity of the gospel,  the world hates the Saints as it did Jesus when he was on  the earth, The world deride the saints because they are  outspoken against wickedness and coruption, The Lord  had gathered up a people to serve him, and to assist  in the building up of the Kingdom of God, The world  has become infidel and becoming more so continually,  The Christianity of the day in conection with its mini-  esters have done more to cause infidelity than all the writings of  Professed Infidels put togeather, he refered to the great  evils that exists in the world, The Lord will hold a  great account against the elders of this generation,  because of the great intelligence God has revealed to us,   The heavens are watching over us, and all good men beyond  the veils are solicutious for our welfare, and are anxious  that we shal prevail against all the evils that are  brought to bear against us, He spoke of the permenancy  of this work because it was of and from God, if it was  of man it could be easily prevailed against, let the  saints then do their duty, and make our probation  effectual, we lived before we came here in the presence of Heavenly  Father & Mother, It would not now pay to apostatise from  the Truth, urged the completion of the Temple that we  may redeem the living and the dead, for God requires  this at our hands, The world wonder and gaze at the elders  and this people they wonder more if God has a hand in  it than he has not, he bore a faithful testimony  to the truth of this world, and assisted the triumph  of this people, and Kingdom, and referred to the  many who have come to an Ignominious end who  have fought against this people, he exorted the saints  to be faithful to the end, and be saved in the Kingdom  of God, and implored the blessings of God upon the saints, 
 Pres. Wilford Woodruff, expressed himself appearingly  of the remarks of the former speaker, he spoke of   the great change, & improvement which have been  wrought in a quarter of a century in these vallies of  these mountains, he spoke of the great future that  is before the saints Judging from the past what may  we expect to take place in the next 1/3 of a century,  to come he spoke of the unbelief of thingsem as also the  infidelity that is to be found in the world, he refered to  the remarks of Bro. Smith in regard to the proper  training of our children, and thought such remarks  were necessary for the benifit of the young and rising   generation, he spoke of the responsibility resting upon the  saints, and ^a^gain adverted ^to^ the great blessings   that is every where manifest through out all Utah,  he spoke of the interposition of the almighty in  preserving the saints and their crops, from the  insect that is here in this country, was glad to  note the increase of the faith and good works among  the saints & especially the young & urged the saints   to educate & train their children and prepare them  for the work that lie before them. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    was pleased to have the opportunity  of listening to the many good re-  marks uttered by the speakers. In   referring to the reports made by   the Bishops respecting the secur-  ing of missionary farms, nearly all  reported a diflicully to obtain the   same. He suggested the propriety  of selecting farms above irrigation  limits and sow rye thereon, and thus   secure a product that would be nearly  or quite as valuable as wheat and  thus form a source of support for the  families of missionaries in the field.    He alluded to the antagonism that  is found in the world against the   [lamb], and remarked that this oppo-  sition existed before Adam was cre-  ated and dwelt here in the flesh. Re-  ferring to the career and treatment  of our Savior, who in the midst of a   cruel and excruciating death, im-  plored the Father to forgive his mur-  derers, for they knew not what they  did. He enjoined upon the Saints,  while their enemies were seeking their  destruction, to emulate the Savior in   his dying agonies to ask the Lord to  forgive them for what they do and  are seeking to do against us, and feel  willing to leave them in the hands of  the Almighty. He spoke of the ne-  cessity of all becoming acquainted  with these things, and exhorted the  young men to study the gospel and  its duties, and touched upon the in-  tricate and perplexing circumstances  that exist among the nations, that  culminate in their destruction.  He was not surprised at the utter-  ances of the priests of the day,  against the Saints, seeking and urg-  ing violent means for their extirpa-  tion. The evil on is their prompter   and abettor, and we could not expect  anything different from them; nev-  ertheless this kingdom will prevail  and overcome all opposing powers.  This is its ultimate destiny. He ex-  horted the Saints to keep all the laws  and commandments of the Lord and   thus entitle themselves to His pro-  tection and blessing. He encour-  aged the Saints to take no heed of   the efforts of the wicked, for oppo-  sition must come, because the Lord  has called us out of the world and as  it hated the Savior so it will the  Saints.

I have  for some time lived in   Salt Lake City and I can sincerle  say that I never did more  rejoye in my heart as when   I could see and hear your  voice.

Many  times I have felt as if I could  embresse you, and when some  time I hear people critise you  it br almost breaks my heart. 
 I Will fill this mission to   the Best of my a bility   and i hope and pray that the   Lord Will be With me that   i may fill this mission in   a right an aceptiable manner  before him and my Brothers  and Sisters.

Dear Bro:    I am in receipt   of a circular letter from  yourself asking me to under-  take a mission to Germany,  and naming as a time of  departure, July 1898.    I must truthfully say   with regard to this call  that it is with by no means  [unalloyed] pleasure and  willingness that I accept.   The slight hesitancy I have hinted  at does not result from a  disposition to shirk any duty  which may devolve upon me    during the Summer months  as was the case last   Summer, or I may not.    In the latter event, I  may be able to obtain  a leave of absence for  the months of July and  August so that I can  leave in July.    I trust what I have   said will meet your  approval.    I remain, Yours truly,    Lewis T. Cannon  Logan, Utah    Salt Lake City, April 29, 1898.    President Wilford Woodruff:    Dear Brother: As Lewis T.

I Willford Woodruff do sincerely promise and swear  that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to his ^her^ Majesty King William the Fourth ^Queen Victoria^.  So help me God. Willford Woodruff    I Willford Woodruff do swear that I do from my heart abhor,  detest, abjure as impious, and heretical, that damnable doctrine and position, that Princes  excommunicated, or deprived by the Pope, or any authority of the See of Rome, may be  deposed, or murdered by their subjects, or any other whatsoever; and I do declare that no  foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate, hath, or ought to have, any jurisdiction,  power, superiority, pre-eminence, or authority, ecclesiastical, or spiritual, within this realm.
