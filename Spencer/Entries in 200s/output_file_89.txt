ENDENTRY The before mentioned is an account of the most conspicuous  part of my Procedings during the year of 1836 which has  gone into eternity with its report as the year before it  hath done and as the one following and all others must do.  O time how swift and how precious thou art. How great  the events that are bourn upon thy wings, esspecially  in the dispensation of the fullness of times. 1836 is  gone it cannot be recalled. Europe hath began to tremble  at thy departure. The endowment of the Latter Day  Saints hath bespake a God in Israel, and is sufficient  to show that though the heavens and earth pass away  the word of God spake through the Prophets must  all be fulfilled. It is true that the thoughts of man  may now retrace his footsteps through 1836 that is  Past. But who can tell whare the end of 1837 will  leave him. Yea that important year that is  mounting the wheels of time to stand upon the  stage of exhistance, to do its Perfect work. Will  not its gigantic operations, and its magnus works  stand upon the Archieves of heaven as great events  Will this gentile generation still sleep in this late  hour, if so sleep on and take thy rest which is short  for thy end is come, and the day hath broke that  Israel must be awoke from his slumber for the last  time and Prepare himself for the Bridegroom. Then let  1837 finish its work with speed and let its departure  Say who hath gone to the tomb and what Kingdom  overturned and what Kingdom esstablished and may  God grant that 1837 may report as she departs  that zion and her stakes indicates that God rules  in her midst with POWER STRENGTH and GLORY.   Thus ends the year of  1836   ENDENTRY April 7, 1837 ~ Friday   April 7th FIGURE I spent the day in writing my Journal. and when the shades of evening began to appear I repaired to the house of the LORD in company with Elders Milton Holmes, and Joseph B Nobles for the purpose of worshiping God we entered one of the stands within the veils and fell upon our knees and satan appeared also but not to worship God but to deprive us of the privilege Satan strove against us with great power by tempting and otherwis he at one time drove me from my stand while I was striving with my brethren to enter into the visions of heaven Notwithstanding his apparent victory good grew out of it for by going into the outer court I there found Elder Freeman Nickerson an aged father in Israel who was faithful and Prayed to God alway I solicited him to join us in prayer that we might gain a victory over satan and get a blessing at the hand of God He joyfully accepted the invitation and we again entered the stand being four of us in number of one accord in one place. We had great cause to be united in heart We all had travled together about 1,000 miles in the spring of 1834 for the redemption of Zion we at that time offered to lay down our lives and our offering was accepted as was Abram's. We felt considering those circumstances that we could kneel down and unitedly get a blessing by faith through Jesus Christ We fell upon our Knees and began to cry unto God Satan departed, tempation found no place in our power of God rested upon us and we were baptized with the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God was like fire shut up in our bones we were immersed in the liberty of the sons of God many great things were shown unto us the power of God and the spirit of prophesy and revelation rested upon us I arose and proclaimed many glorious thing upon the heads of my beloved brethreth that were present which were dictated in my heart by the Holy Spirit. And I Willford testify in the name of Jesus Christ that many  precious things were shown me concerning my brethren by the Holy Spirit in prophecy and revelation. Our hearts were made glad and we went our way rejoicing FIGURE    ENDENTRY April 8, 1837 ~ Saturday   April 8th Spent the day in writing my Journal Spent the evening at Elder Milicans in Good Company    ENDENTRY April 9, 1837 ~ Sunday   9th Sunday morning I repaired to the house of the Lord to worship with the Saints Father John Smith opened the meeting by prayer then read the ##2 Nephi 12|twelvth chapter## of the second Book of Nephi and preached from it unto the people. In the latter part of the Day Elder Kimble addressed the saints in the O. Pratt followed with few remarks after S Rigdon addressed the congregation and laid before them their situation as to temporal things, as the gentiles are striving to besiege the saints in Kirtland and would be glad to starve the saints to death. He also stated that the Presidency had used every means for the deliverance of the church but as many of the church had refused Kirtlan currency which was their temporal salvation in consequence of this they put strength in the hands of their enemies and those that had done this thing must suffer by it Sidney closed and   Joseph arose and like the lion of the tribe of JUDAH he poured out his soul in the midst of the Congregation of the Saints but who can find lang^u^ague to write his words and teachings as with an iron pen in a rock that they may stand for future generation to look upon. A fountain of knowledge rolled from his mouth to the people which was the word of God. Yea in the name of God he proclaimed that severe Judgment awaited those characters that professed to be be his friends and friends to humanity and the Kirtland Safety Society But had turned traitors and opposed the curr ency and its friends which has given power into the hands of the enemy and oppressed the poor saints such have become covenant Break ers for which they will feel the wrath of God as true as Joseph is a prophet   ENDENTRY Joseph uttered the feelings of his soul in pain while viewing the poverty and afflictions of Ephraim or the Saints in fals brethren should be whited walls and bring perrils upon the Saints. Joseph is as a father to Ephraim and to all Israel in these last days, he mourns because of unbelief and the negligence manifest with ma ny who have receieved the gospel in obeying the commands of God he fears lest ^but^ few be left to receieve an inheritance. There is not a greater man than Joseph standing in this generation. The gentiles look upon him and he is to them like bed of Gold conceled from human view: they know not his prin ciple, his spirit, his wisdom, virtue, phylanthr opy, nor his calling. His mind like Enochs swells wide as eternity Nothing short of a God can comprehend his soul    ENDENTRY April 10, 1837 ~ Monday April 10th I wrote two letters to the land of Zion one to Elder A. O.

We were married at the house of President JOSEPH SMITH, Jr The ceremony was solemnized by President Frederick G. Williams President. J. Smith Sen the Patriarch then blessed us in the name of the Lord and pronounced great Blessings upon us and our posterity. President. J. Smith Jr was expecting to solemnize the ceremony, but his life was so beset and sought for by wicked and ungodly men for the testimony of JESUS, that he was under the necessity of fleeing from his house and home for a few days. O when will the prophets of ^God^ rest upon the earth.   We were married at 2 oclock PM and at 4 PM. the whole company consisting of about 16 couple walked from President J. Smiths. to President S Rigdons whare we were gratifyed with the privilege of seeing Elder Thalia Rigdon also Joined in matrimony by President F G Williams The company dispersed at the sitting of the sun I spent the night at President Joseph Smiths May the Lord bless us all with salvation   ENDENTRY The sun in the east arose to gladden earth and shed oe'r nature his pleaseing beams to wellc ome the return of delightful spri ng that drearry winter might be forgotten. No day more pleas ing than April thirteenth 1837 While all nature smiled without friendships purest joys were felt beneath a prophets roof whare the brides and bri desgroom found a welcome reception. While by law with the nuptial cord their hands were bound their congenial hearts in one, lay cemented bearing the seal of Eternal life. Their friendship formed from principle pure, virtue unsuled, bid refinement oe'r those hearts to rule, possessing the love of GOD the ownly founda tion of true friendship. True the prophet wife, children, and house for a moment had fled had torn himself from their embrace in some lonely place to seek a shelter to escape the blood thirsty gentiles hands against him ra ised for bearing the testimo ny of Jesus Christ. A Patriarch yet was left. He Posessing a Holy Priesthood more ancient than his gray hairs arose upon his feet to bless in the name of GOD the married four. Being clothed in the spirit through the power of the priesthood he pronounced upon the wedded heads and their posterity blessing that ne'r decay   While heaven smiles upon the Elders of Israel friendship presents each with a bride as a help meet whose prayers will be waft ed by a more holy breeze than wind up to the throne of GOD for their companions while bound in chains and vaults in prisons cast for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. These feeble words inspire their harts to call on God that he may here and send deliverance to the bridegroom in distance lands while under zions banner the bride finds protections.   O heaven protect the four that they their cove nants may fulfill that friend ship may grow old but pure and strong as death that pea ce and harmony may crown their lives.

With a degree of admiration I gaz'd upon the change five years had brought upon her. Her spri ghtly step with energy was marked wh ile teaching the young. To more per fectly call to mind the recollection of youth and past scenes and to enterta in my mind amid the passing hours, this Sister presented me, with a cheerful grace, a bundle of Letters from an absent Brother. I look'd them throu gh and throug, they pressed my soul with feelings. Asahel yes thy letters I read fifteen in number to thy sister directed. They brought to my soul as great ^a^ variety of feelings, as matter they contained. They presented before they ^my^   mind ^view^ the display of a cultivated mind and the refined talents of a brother presented to a Sister with the most untarnished friendship, and deepest feeling for her wellfare that can grace the human Soul. Such teaching as those to Eunice directed if followed by the female youth would lead them by a thousand snares.

It is at once beneficial and instructive to the reflecting mind to review the past with candour and rightly consider the present and be in perfect readiness for that which is to come. Whare is the Son or dau ghter of Adam who hath a standing in this day and generation that is walking in the light and truth as it is in Jesus Christ that can survey this gentile nation with ins ensibility or realize their situation without feelings of the deepest emotion. Who of us that hath been upheld and supported from our infantile moments to manhood and carried through many dangers seen and unseen both temp oral and spiritual and been receieved into the new and everlasting Covenant which God hath made in these last days   ENDENTRY With his children. that will hesitate to stand as a bold witness for the gospel of Jesus Christ and follow him through evil as well as good report and surrender himself a living sac rifice holy and acceptable unto God which is his reasonable service.   Believeing it to be benificial to review our past life And not ownly our privilege but duty to keep an accurate account of our procedings. And it is to this intent that I shall endeavour henceforth to keep a journal of my travels that when required I may give an accou nt of my stewardship   ENDENTRY March 1st 1801 My parents both mother were born and bred in the town of Farmington Connecticut. My father Aphek Woodruff was the Son of Eldad Woodruff. My mother Bulah Thompson was the daughter of Lot Thompson all of the town of Farmington C.t.   I was born in the north part of the town of Farmington which is now called Avon    ENDENTRY March 1st 1807. From the age of 14 to 23 my mind was often exer cised upon the subject of my souls salvation yet without submision to God or being led by his spirit untill the age of 23. Then at that age I resolved by the grace of God assisting me to be led by the word of God into that truth which maketh free the reby. I had no desire to join any of the sectarian Churches for I found by compareing the Churches with the records of divine truth that they    ENDENTRY December 29th 1833 were neither contending nor receievi ng the faith once delivered to the Sain ts I could not discover the Church or body of Christ visible among men. I believed the Church of Christ was in the wilderness and that there had been a falling away from the pure and undefiled religion before God And I was a looking for the Church to arise and again to be esstablished upon the foundation of the ancient Apostles and Prophets Christ Jesus the Chief Corner Stone. After remai ning in this state of mind for near ly the term of four years I herd a report circulated on the 29th day of Dec 1833. that there was to be a meeting held in the neighbourhood by a Mormon priest. This meeting was to be held in the Town of Richland Oswego County New York. I had moved two years previous to this from Connecticut to this place with my older Brother Azmon Woodruff   ENDENTRY December 1833 We had purchased a farm together and been living on it nearly two years. We both were anxious to attend the meeting. Accordingly we we went and found a full cong regation of people. The person that was to preach was Zerah Pulsipher an elder in the Church of Christ or of the latter day saints. He commenced the meeting with some introductory rem arks and then prayed I felt the spirit of God to bear witness that he was the servant of God. He then commenced preaching and that to us with authority, and when he had finished his discourse I truly felt that it was the first gospel sermon that I had ever herd I thought it was what I had long been looking for I could not feel it my duty to leave the house without bearing witness to the truth before the people. I opened my eyes to see my ears to hear my heart to understand and my doors to entertain him who had administered unto us. Brother Pulsipher    ENDENTRY  ENDENTRY December 31st 1833 Continued labouring with us for several days and on the 31st of Dec I with my Brother Azmon Woodruff with two yong females which had been hea led by the laying on of hands went forw ard in baptism. the day following there was several others followed our example among the rest was Noah Hatton a preacher in the freewill Baptist Church and several of the members of his Church followed him in the ordi nance of baptism. And on the 2nd of Jan.ry. 1834 Brother Pulsipher es^s^tablish ed a branch of the Church of Christ in Richland Oswego Co. N.Y. containing twelve members. He ordained Brother Azmon Woodruff and Brother Noah Hatton Elders and myself a teacher in the Church of Christ. I truly felt that I could exclaim with the servant of God that it was better to be a door keeper in the house of God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness I felt much of the spirit of God bearing witness   ENDENTRY Jan. 2nd 1834   To the Book of Mormon. I believed it was light out of darkness and truth out of the ground. The license which I receieved reads thus. A Power and authority given to Willford Woodruff provi ng that he is a Teacher in the Church of Christ by the will of God the Father according to his holy Calling and the gift ^and power^ of the Holy ghost agreeable to the Revelations of Jesus Christ signifying that he has been baptized and receieved into the Church according to the articles and Covenants of the same and ordained under the hand of Zerah Pulsipher. Given at Richland Janry 2nd AD 1834 Zerah Pulsipher I continued with my Brethren in  Richland through the months of Janry  Febuary and March labouring with the Church we had considerable opposition yet inasmuch as we were humble the Lord ever delivered us ENDENTRY April 1st 1834   I went with Brother Hatton to meet Brother Pulsipher and several other brethren and sisters at Brother Newcomes house in Fabius we had an interesti ng meeting. the spirit of the Lord was  with us we returned home rejoiceing we soon was visited by Brother Harry Brown elder and Brother James Blakesly Priest they held two meetings with us and we were much edefied and they went on there way rejoiceing. We were visited no more by the Breth ren untill about the first of Aprail at which time Brother Harry Bro wn returned accompanied by Brother Parley Pratt we had a precious interv iew Brother Parley preached with us un till about midnight he was on an impo rtant mission he with Brother Lyman  Wight was under a command of the Lord to gather together some of the serv ants of the Lord to go up to Zion it was the Lords will that they should gather together five hundred but not to return   ENDENTRY April 11th 1834   Less than an hundred it was the will of the Lord that the yong men and middle aged what could be spared should go up to Zion. I told Brother Parley our circumstances he told me it was my duty to try to prepare myself and go up to Zion. And accordingly I used evry exertion to settle my accounts arange my affairs and prepare myself to join my Brethren to go to Missourie and on the 10th of Aprail Brother Warren Ingles called at our house to accompany me on my journey to the west they remained with me and my Brother untill the day following then on the 11th day of Aprail 1834 after prepareing my horses and waggon I took the parting hand with my Brother Azmon and his family And also with the Bretheren and Sisters  in the Church and commenced our    ENDENTRY April 1834     Journey for Kirtland which place was appointed to meet at by the first day of May 1834 that all those who were going up to Zion might go together accord ing to the word of the Lord. We called on the Brethren at Lyons and spent the sabbath with them And the next  Sabbath we spent with the brethren, at Genesee c then we continued our journey we called on Brother  MCWithy and spent the night with him we also called on Brother Lewis we there found Brother John Murdock; and Orson Pratt we spent the sabbath with them and herd them both preach and on monday continued our journ ey for Kirtland accompanyied by Brother John and Orson. Brother Ingols and myself called on Brother Strong at Thompson and spent the night with him I was much edified with his conversation I had a view of the draft of the City of Zion which he held in his possession we continued ENDENTRY April 25th 1834   To travel towards Kirtland and arived there at night on the 25th of Aprail 1834 There for the first time I had a view of our beloved Brother Joseph Smith the Prophet and Seer which God hath raised up in these last days through whom the saints receieve Revelations from time to time. Brother Joseph invited   Text printed between lines of cursive text I here for the first time became acquainted with Elder camp to Mo. 26 April I was introduced to Elder Brigham Young Heber C Kimball. Br Young gave me a Butcher knife   us to take up our abode with him and accordingly we did and boarded at his house most of the time for a week here I became not ownly acquainted with him and his family but with many of the brethren both high priests, Elders, and private members those which were making it their home at Kirtland and also those which were gathering for the purpose of going up to Zion. on the 27th of Aprail being the Lords day I attended meeting and herd several of the Brethren preach. Brother Orson  Pratt and others spoke ^Joseph Smith Closing^ during the meeting It appeared to me there was more light made manifest at that meeting   ENDENTRY May 1st 1834    respecting the gospel and Kingdom of  God than I had ever receieved from  the whole Sectarian world. According to appointment on the first day of May 1834 we left Missouri there  was not but a small part of the company  left Kirtland untill the Monday following  on account of their not being in readi ness going five days later. There was four  baggage waggons and rising of 20 men  in the company which left Kirtland the  first of May. We traveled to New Portage  and there remained with the Church unt ill the remainder of the company joined  us from Kirtland which was on the  ENDENTRY 6th of  May then we were organized in regular  order and took up our march on the  ENDENTRY 8th  day of May. Our march was similar to  the ancient Israelites. Our horses, waggons  and tents were in readiness and we were led  by Joseph. Our Company now cosisted  of twenty baggage waggons and rising of  one hundred and fifty men. The men  were armed with dirks pistols Swords and rifles    ENDENTRY May 8th 1834   For Self defence and according to Brother Joseph's request I delivered him my Sword for his own use, our lives were threatened in consequence of advocating and maintaining the gospel of Jesus Christ for this cause it became necessary to be in readiness to defend our lives our persons and property. As I before said we commenced our march or jour ney on the 8th day of May from New por tage the weather vary pleasant and deligh tful we continued to travel through the day and dwell in our tents at night. I  witnessed many interesting things while on this journey we made it a practice of pitching our tents on Saturday night and not rem ove them untill Monday morning we  had preaching on the Lords day. Brother Joseph often addressed us in the name of the Lord while on our journey and often while addressing the camp he was clothed upon with much of the spirit of God his precepts were verry instructive and interesting. While on our travels   ENDENTRY May 1834   we visited many of the mounds which were flung up by the ancient inhabitants  of this Continent probably by the Nephites and Lamanites. we visited one of these Mounds   Printed between lines of cursive text *considerd to be 300 feet above the level of the Illinois  river three persons dug into the mound and found  a dody. Elder Milton Holmes took the arrow out of the back bones that killed Zelph and brought it with some of the bones in to the camp, I visited the same mound with Jesse J Smith who the other persons were that dug in the mound and found the body I am undecided   and several of the brethren dug into it and took from it the bones of a man. Brother  Joseph had a vission respecting the person he said he was a white Lamanite the curs was taken from him or at least in part. he was killed in battle with an arrow the arrow was found among his ribs, one of his thigh bones was broken this was done by a stone flung from a sling in battle years before his death his name was Zelph some of his bones were brought into the camp and the thigh bone which was broken was put into my waggon and I carried it to Missouri. Zelph was a large thick set man and a man of God he was a warrior under the great prophet ^Onandagus^ that was known from the Rocky mo untains. The above knowledge Joseph receieved in a vision    ENDENTRY May 1834   It excited the curiosity of people more to See Such a Company of people traveling through the country in perfect order people came forth out of there houses to behold the Scene and thou sands of questions were asked concer ning our movements. We had seve ral rivers to ferry and when we arived at Salt River we pitched our tents to remain stationary for several days and on the day following our arival at Salt River we were joined by Brother Lyman Wight and the company of Brethren which he had gathered together at Misigan or in that region of country it was a joyful meeting This added to our company so that it now consisted of 25 baggage waggons and about two hundred men we rem ained at Salt River about one week we were reorganized and Brother Lyman Wight was now appointed as a leader of the army.
