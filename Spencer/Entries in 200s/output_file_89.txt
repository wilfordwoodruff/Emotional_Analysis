 Historian's Office, G. S. L. CityOctober 4th 1856.Dear Brother C. C. Rich,Your favor of Sept 8th came tohand on the 1st inst. It is a general time of health throughoutthe Territory so far as we can learn.Your collections of fruit and flowers will be thankfullyreceived, and care taken to preserve and propogate from them.Bro Bullock started on his mission to England on the 10th ult,and requested Bro Leo Hawkins to receive all fruit cuttings & intendedfor him.There has been, and is a great spirit of reformation throughoutthe Territory, especially in Davis County, some of the wards inthat county stepping forth to a man and requesting rebaptism.Prest Grant baptised upwards of eighty with his own hands.We never have had such pointed, plain and strong ^mormon^ sermons sincethe foundation of the Church, as are now preached by thePresidency on this subject.On the 26th ult, the Presidency, with the Brass Band,a detachment of the Lancers, and a number of the citizensleft the city at 9 a. m., to meet the Hand Cart Companies underElders E. Ellsworth and Daniel D. McArthur, they met themat the foot of the little mountain, and escorted them into the city,where they arrived about 5 1/2 P.M. The feelings  of the brethren onmeeting them cannot be described; their hearts were so full thatthey could not find utterance. The brethren in the different wardsdealt out provisions &c liberally to them. We feel that it is 
 Historian's office. G. S. L. City April 1 1857.Elder Erastus SnowDear Sir,The Eastern mail arrived on the 24th. Ulto. bringing the last Oct. & Nov. mails; containing 28 Brass locksacks:it brought many letters to Prest. Young; and 17 to myself. Amongothers, I received letters from Elders Taylor, Geo. A. Smith, E. T. Benson,J. M. Bernhisel, and one from yourself, bearing date Sep. 25 1856.The Mail was accompanied by Elder J. L. Heywood, they had towinter at Devil's gate: the company suffered much from the wantof food. There were about 20 of our brethren there, and they alllived about one month on ox hides: they left their winter Quar-ters as soon as they possibly could get through in consequence of the snow, and it was with great difficulty they got throughwhen they did. We have not heard any word from the winter mails, but have learned that the snow was very deepboth East and West of Laramie. We have had more snowin the mountains and vallies throughout the Territory than wehave ever known before since we came here. The snow is now off from the vallies, but the mountains are deeply clad. We have lost but little stock during the past winter in comparisonto the loss we sustained the previous Winter.We have had much later news from you and thebrethren East via the California mail.As fas as news is concerned with us in Utah I willsay we are having universal health, peace and plenty throughoutthe Territory so far as I know.Spring has broken upon us warm and mild, everykind of fruit tree that has suffificiently matured is loaded with 
 Historian's office.G. S. L. city april 1 1857Dear bro. BensonThe Eastern mail finally got in on the 24th. Ult. bringing 28 sacks of mail. It brought the Oct. & Nov. mail: itbrought me over 15 letters from G. A. Smith, J. Taylor, E. Snow &c. and also your interesting letter from Copenhagen of Sep 30. I should have been delighted to have been with you on your journey through those oldcountries: it must have been very pleasant and I feel to rejoice tosee how the work of the Lord grows in the midst of all opposition, I know it will grow till it fills the whole earth. Bro. Brigham saidthe other night at the prayer circle, that he was satisfied that the Lordwould soon open a door in the midst of all these nations, he said he would like to send a man to Siberia, and the Japanese islands &c. There will be a company of Missionaries selected for Europe at the Conferenceall will go with hand carts from the vallies to the States: bro. Mack-intosh is among the number.We have had a very interesting winter both in the Legislatureand in the church. The Twelve have stood at the head of some40 missionaries for this city. I have attended a meeting about every eveningfor 5 months; the power of God has been with us and much of theHoly Spirit poured out. We have had some of the loudest preachingthis winter I ever heard, the fruits of the Reformation have been veryvisible; the people have confessed their sins, whether they have been greator small, and made restoration as far as possibleâthe thief has returnedthe stollen property or done what they could at it. all have beendown into the waters of baptism commencing with the Presidency 
 Historian's office. G. S. L. City April 1 1857.Brother Geo. A. Smith; Dear Sir,I take pleasure in announcing to youthat the Eastern mail arrived on the 24th. Ulto.: bringing 28 brasslock sacks, having left 2 by the way; it brought the last Oct. & Nov. mail:anything later we have not heard by the Eastern mail. The mail wasaccompanied by our friend J. L. Heywood, they all wintered about Devilsgate with about 20 of the brethren. They suffered much: subsistingfor one month on poor beef, and the next month on Hides. Brother Heywood considers he has gained quite an experience in cooking raw hides,they boiled, roasted, stewed and fried all ways; they all lived through itand left as soon as they could get through for snow, and came nearleaving the mail at last. Many had much anxiety about brother Hey-wood and all were glad to see him come home: he looks well with hislong sandy beard. The mail brought me 6 letters from you includingthe one sent by A. W. Babbitt who, as you know was killed by the way.I was truly glad to hear from you and that you was preserved in therailroad smash up.I was glad to hear that you had got along so well withbro. Taylor in getting us out so good a history of the death of Joseph.I have not yet seen it, I have not heard how it was sent, if bymail, I expect it will turn up by and bye when the Winter mails arriveI called on Bathsheba and read all my letters to her: she had receivedletters from you too. I was pleased with your dream and I believe that you will be enabled to start the cars engine or no engine that isvisible, it will be all right anyway. We will file it in the office.We have had a hard winter in Utah if 8 feet of snow in the vallies, and from 1 to 100 in the mountains makes a hard winter 
 G. S. L. City Sep 30, 1856Hon. G. A. Smith,Dear Sir,At a late hour in the night I seat myself to write a few lines to you as the mail goes out on the morrow,it is universal peace, health and prosperity throughout this countryas far as I know. We are having a very favorable fallto do all kinds of work, except to sow wheat, it still continuesdry, wells are failing. some think the cutting of the timber onthe mountain heights is partially the cause. Our early Frosts haveinjured the late corn, wheat has come in quite well considering thatwe have had no rain or water. The people are selling their wheatas usual for $1.00 & $1.50 Flour $2.50 & $3.00 & $400 per cwt.notwithstanding we have just passed through a famine, these thingsought not to be, for I think the people will want bread before anotherharvest. Some brethren have returned from Carson valley, they do notlike the country very well, besides they have to fight their way measur-ably among the Gentiles. I received a letter from Gen. Rich from San Bernardino by the mail to day, they are all well there as faras I can learn. The vigilance committee in San Francisco have dis-banded, having hung all the wicked, and driven the guilty off. Elder N. V. Jones has just come in from the lead mines reports allright in that quarter. We have moved into our new office and findit much more convenient and very comfortable and refined, we havegot the History as far as the organization of the church with Prest. Young and the Twelve at its head.One of the most interesting events of the kind inthis church and kingdom was the arrival of two companies of the 
 Historian's Office G. S. L. City. Oct 31, 1856Dear Brother Geo A. Smith,Although it is the last of Month the Eastern mail has not arrived, and we do not expect it until about the 10th or 15th of November, if by any accident it should chance to drop in on us thenâfor our present contractors are not at all to be relied on.Two messengers have just arrived from the hand cart company under Elder J. G. Willie: When they left, thecompany was two miles below Rocky Ridge on the Sweetwater.They bring bad news of that company; through startingso late in the season they have got caught in the snow-storms and many have died. When the teams sent out at conference arrived at this camp, there had been twenty deathsânineteen of them men, and while with them in one day there were fifteen burials, and when the messengers left there had been fifty five deaths. They did not seem to be sick, but chilled through: men would dig graves for their brethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed their last rations the night before relief came to them and they did not know that any was at hand. Nothing had been heard of the last company of hand carts. They have had several severe storms, although there is not so much snow between here and Sweetwater, as below that pointAt least 250 teams have been sent out to meet those companies, and several tons of flour, and great quantities 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. CitySeptember 30th 1856.Hon. J. M. Bernhisel,Dear Sir,I write to say that your wagon andthree yoke of oxen and goods all came safe. I think BroMillett has taken great pains to do well and get the cattlethrough. He and his wife have walked all the way, nearly.One of the oxen was sickly: They were delivered to BrothersRichards and Cain, and I suppose they have been put uponthe range. The wagon is in my yard, sound and whole. Bro.Millet had to obtain some things in order to get along, to theamount of $6 or $8; the flour that was given him was adulteratedwith some mineral. He had to leave in storage at Florence,the following articles, as he had too much load:1 Parlor Stove.1 Box Glass5 Sheets of Iron.1 Keg Linseed Oil.1 Keg White Lead, 50 lbs1 Grass Seed Separator.Signed, James McGrawB. Woolley.I put one of the Boxes in my house, and put into it everything you directed which had come. I delivered to MrsBernhisel all the articles as directed, and she called and gota bill of goods at the retail price, was $146.26.I have a bill of the articles. 
 like opening the flood gates of deliverance to the thousands ofEurope, who are bound for the want of means; it having been nowproven that this thing can be accomplished, these companies havingtravelled about 1400 miles on foot, drawing their provisions andbedding in hand carts all the way, and beaten every ox team onthe road.The Deseret State Fair was held in the Deseret Store inthis city on the second, third, and fourth, insts., and it truly wasdelightful to witness the splendid display of home manufacturedgoods which were there exhibited: it has developed the talent andability of Utah's artizans in a degree that exceeded our most sanguine expectations, and we trust it will give an impetus tohome manufactures which will continue to roll until we no longerwill have to expend the best of our means in the purchase ofimported goods (A report we expect will appear in the DeseretNews). The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society, since their organization have been laboring diligentlyto bring about this desirable object, and it is gratifying to witnessthe success of their efforts. The plowing match came off on the2nd inst., on Prest. Young's land immediately south of the city, andthe exhibition of stock on the 3rd.Elders Jos. A. Young, F. D. Richards, Wm H. Kimball, Geo D.

 fruit buds, many ready to burst into blooms. I think we willhave a very fruitful season for fruit, grains and vegetables the ground is well soaked with water from the recent deep snows.The big cotton wood canal is nearly finished and will soon be ready to receive the water for irrigation, and loading theGranite for the Temple: there are now many stone-cutters atwork around the Temple and we expect their numbers will be greatly increased after conference; it is pleasing music to hearthe sound of the hammer and chisel again.The past has been a very interesting winter with us in Utah. The Presidency, Twelve and many others have been very busy during the winter holding meetings with the people,the spirit and power of God has been with us. I have attendedmeetings with the Heads or in the Quorums every night throughthe week, bro. F. D. Richards has been with me most of the Winter,L. Snow and O. Hyde part of the time.We expect A. Lyman and C. C. Rich about the first ofMay. I expect they will take a European mission.The Presidency and most of the Twelve here and manyothers are expecting to take a trip North as far as Salmon river.Brother Erastus, I want to say to you that Brothers Frank-lin, Lorenzo and myself have often met together and at timesBrother Hyde with us we have often spoke of you & felt,much to sympathise with you, and felt to sustain you withour faith and prayers for we do realize that you have had a great care and labor upon you. I expect Prest. Young willliberate you this Spring, and send H. S. Eldridge to succeed youand let you rest from your labors awhile, so I want you 
 Historians office.G. S. L. City April 1 1857Elder Taylor Dear Sir,Our Eastern Mail for October and Novemberarrived in this city on the 24th. inst.; containing 28 brass lock sacks;30 were sent, but 2 of them were deposited somewhere. The Mailhas grown several months old while on the way, mostly atDevils gate: it was accompanied by our friend J. L. Heywood,who reports, that while weather bound at the Devils gate, the company suffered much for the want of food; having subsisted for one month on Ox hides entirely. The Mail company left that point as soon as they could possibly get through the snow;and it was with great difficulty they got through when theydid. The Mail brought Prest. Young a great many letters,(and to me the following: 2 from yourself, of dates Septem.16 and October 18 respectively: 5 from Hon. Geo. A. Smith, July 8, 27, Augt. 10, Septem. 14 & Oct 22: Elder Erastus Snow Sept. 25:Hon. J. M. Bernhisel Sep. 13 and Oct. 15: Elder Joel M. Berry Sep: 1 & Oct. 13, and Messrs. Wm. R. Prince ^Hy^ Oct. 18: Elder E. T. Benson Copenhagen Sep. 30; and I. F. Carter Portland Maine.) We have not yet had any word from the Mails of the winter months,but we have learned that the snow was very deep East aswell as West of Laramie. We have had more snow in the mountains and vallies through this Territory than we have everseen since our settlement in these mountains; yet there has been but a small amount of stock lost in comparison to theloss last season.I was truly gratified to hear from you by letter and 
 followed by the Twelve. Our Tabernacle, school houses, and all places, of worship have been filled to overflowing throughout the Territory. Thepeople are paying their Tithing, the public store houses are well filledwith grain. Many are getting wives and their Endowments. Prest. Youngis nearly worn out waiting upon the people day and night. He is expecting to leave this Spring, with H. C. Kimball the Twelve, (exceptmyself) and about 100 others on a tour to Salmon river to see thecountry.We have had the most snow ever known in this Territory thepast Winter; snow has fallen in our city over 8 feet deep by measurement;this has well soaked the ground, and I think we shall have a veryfruitful season, all fruit trees are loaded with fruit buds. They aregetting a head well at Tooele. I see bro. Rowberry frequently, they havegot a reformation at Grantsville: restored Bishop Clark to the Presidencyand Cooley has given it up. Your flouring mill is running, yourfamily are well. I see sister Benson occasionally. I do not have anytime to visit with my own family.The Bishops and various companies are sending to the Statesfor sheep. A good many of us will plant some chinese sugar canein the valley this season and try it, we think it will be of greatbenefit to us. There has hardly been a Ball or party of pleasure inthis Territory for this six months. I am very busy on the History.A few will go to California this Spring, some few in the Southernsettlements have started for California, by the short rout called the cutoff. I expect some others will follow them soon for they do not love to dwellwith the righteous. There is a company going to the Santa Clara to raise cotton. The brethren have made out 1200 lbs of lead and abandoned the business, as it is very expensive, and does not pay norwork as well as expected. I shall be pleased to hear from you from 
 ^see next page 455^seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as muchas they have done the past winter and hope it will continue to the powerof God has been with [them] their preaching and teaching in all the Quorum and Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant beforehe died, and after his death the burden of the care of the Missionariesrested upon me and brother F. D. Richards who was unwell considerable,but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Hyde have been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelve (except myself) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summer Trip Northto Salmon river.This spring A. Lyman & C. C.  Rich will be with us about the first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, some missionaries will be called to Europe and to the islands. President Young would liketo send a mission to Siberia and the Japanese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene and Kanosh with other chiefs are making great improvement. Arrowpeene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, it was good.We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or 12.00 lbs; it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected. a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going to try the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory.some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southern settlements have started on the short roads, [or] cut off to go there,and no doubt some others will follow them soon.  Your family are all well, you and the brethren associated with you are earnestly remembered in our prayers.As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to[text continues on the top of the page interlinearly]the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the other matters including the history of the Twelve up to the organization of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham Young and his fathers family briefly, and nowam at work with the history of the Twelve, from their first organization in a brief form, taking all that belonged to it, up to the 8 [August] 1844. We have no trouble now with the Gentiles here [in court] or any where else. It would amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filed in our officeâtoo lengthy to insert, [with] Dr. Hurt, Gen. Burr andsome smaller fry, to bullyrag [all our] laws and their defenders, a part of them came armed with [colts,] revolvers, it ended in T. S. Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's [dismissal] from the Bar; and some others who intended to use the pistols went out of the house in the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for runners, dropping their loaded weapons while going [rest of page illegible] 
 hand cart trains. the Presidency with many others, and a company of Lancers went out to meet them in the mountains, they metthem about the foot of the little mountain, it was an effectingscene, after passing the greetings and salutations they formed tocome into the city, one half of the Lancers in front followedby the presidency, citizens, band and marshal, then followed 500men, women and children drawing their 100 hand carts, which they had drawn 1400 miles, the rear was brought up by the Lancers. As they went through the city, the Streets were crowded with thousandsof people who stood and gazed with wonder and amazement tiarsstarting in their eyes, the scene was beyond description, to beholdold men women and children covered with dust dancing with joyas they passed along it filled our hearts until we were spechless,we felt that the flood gates of deliverance to the millions of the oppressed were hoisted, and we could say to the poor Saints "comehome to Zion",  for your way is open. Elders Ellsworth & Mcarthurhave gained great honor to themselves by leading that bravecompany of hand cart pioneers, they walked all the way, helpedalong the carts, healing the sick and comforting the weak all they could,and when they arrived in the city, they continued at the head of their companies, drawing the hand carts covered with dust, till theircompanies were safely encamped on the Public square, and were fed bythe presents of the populace: then the brethren went to see theirown families. Prest. Young has been sanguine all the time thattravelling with hand carts was a safe and practical operation, &it has now been proved to be so. the company declare the fewox teams they had were a hindrance to them, they had to wait 
 of clothing.Brother Smoot had to leave 100 head of cattle at Bridgets, and most of his freight.The President has suggested the idea of establishing posts, one at devil's gate, one at Wood River, one at DeerCreek, and one below Laramie, to put a stop to so late starting.The Presidency started East to meet the Immigration but while on Kanyon Creek Prest Young was taken soseverely ill that the company was obliged to return.Your family are all well.Yours truly.W Woodruff 
 Brother Cain has drawn some wood with your oxen toyour house. Houtz has begun to bring some flour of late.His Mill does all the grinding in that place: he runs itnearly night and day.I have written to Hon. Geo. A.

City July 1 1857Brother Lyman WightDear SirI take the liberty of addressing afew lines to you for various reasons, one is for old acquaintance sake,and another for the purpose of making a request of you, and uponthis subject I will write first, it is this. During the last year I have been engaged in writing the History of the church and especiallythe History of the Twelve. I am taking up the Quorum from thecommencement, have been trying to write your History but I cannot dojustice to it at all without your assistance, and on the receipt ofthis I wish you would write a sketch of your life and forward itto me to this city, name your lineage or forefathers as far back asyou can get, with anything you know about them, and where youwas born and when, what your religion was before you embraced the Gospel, where you was baptized and who by and all yourordinations, and by whom ordainedâan outline of all your missions.Was you not in the war of 1812? What offices have you ever heldin church or state. I want you to give me the particulars of yourconversation with General Wilson the night you was taken prisonerwhen he wanted you to betray Joseph, that was an important timewith you, and for that deed alone you shall have salvation; giveme an account of your going with Judge Higbee some 6 or 7 miles to intercept a company of 40 men going I think to Jackson County alsoof the 7 men armed, who chased you on a certain occasion, when youleaped a ditch with your horse which the others could not leap, and any incident of your life that should be preserved as History; please 
 time to time to know how you get along: it seems our brethrenat Washington have not been able to accomplish anything with ourimorial for a State government yet, but I believe that the Lordwill govern it all right.If we have any more emigration from England this Springor Summer, I hope they never will start so late as they did last season:it cost this city and territory more to get them brought through the snow, than it would to have paid their fare all the way from Liverpool. during emigration time it was by miracle almost that they were savedat all, about every horse and mule team within 40 miles of here hadto go out in the mountains from 1 to 10 weeks. I lost my lot frmhorse and wagon left &c: it cost tens of thousands of dollars to closeup the operation. My love to all who inquire after me.As ever I remain,yours truly,W. Woodruff 
 to keep up good courage, do what you can and dont worry aboutthe rest. I feel as though the Lord will sustain you, and bring youhome in peace.In answer to your inquiry about the proportionments of the Deseret alphabet Fonts; I would say I had that portion of your letterread to Prest. Young, and he said your letter of instructions expressedthe desired information, which he would have re-copied and sent youagain by this mail. He wishes you to get a few made, not as fullfont, but some of each kind and have them tried, and see if they will work, then to bring on the ma[illegible]s and pictures so that wecan make those here as we have a good deal of old type, [but] asyou will have a bill of instructions again from him upon the subjectI need not enlarge further. I hope you will be successful in this matter.The Presidency are very singly busy in the Endowment house.Enclosed you will find a letter to Geo A. Smith whichif he is with you, or in, the States please forward to him: Your family and all the families of the Twelve are well. I have beenso busy during the winter in attending meetings and the labors of my office that I have hardly had any time to visit any body, hardly my own familys. I feel to pray with all my heart that the Lordwill bless and sustain you, in your work and missions, and that youmay have grace equal to your duty and return again in peace, toyour family and friends during the Summer.As ever, I remainYours trulyW. Woodruff 
 ^from page 455^earnestly remembered in our prayers.As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up tothe death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the other matters including the history of the Twelve up to the organizationof the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of BrighamYoung and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on thehistory of the Twelve from their first organization in a brief formtaking all that belonged to it up to the 8 August 1844. We haveno trouble now with the Gentiles here in court or anywhere else. Itwould amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filedin our officeâtoo lengthy to insertâwith Dr. Hurt, Gen. Burr and some smaller fry, to bullyrag all our laws and their defenders, apart of them came armed with colts, revolvers, it ended in T. S. Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's dismissal from the Bar; andsome others who intended to use the pistols went out of the housein the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for run-ners, dropping their loaded weapons while going out, which they never afterwards found. all has been quiet since, having but little lawing on hand.Please not expose my succatash letter to the press, forI write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I would while writing to men who publish papers.Gen. Burr has written to the department as we areinformed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timberin the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Springof going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and taking a ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on thetop of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not costall it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leavinghim to be the judge. yours truly W. Woodruff 
 several hours each day for them, they consider they would have beenhere 10 days sooner without them, were provisions left at variouspoints for them, they came through in about 9 weeks and a few days.We are in the commencement of a great reformation, thePresidency are preaching the strongest and most heart searching & powerful sermons that I ever heard delivered in the church andkingdom of God, they are weighing the people in the balances and the people are found wanting, the President has calledupon the people en masse to repent and be baptized for theremission of sins and they are following their council by whole wards in some places, and I expect it will be the case in thiscity.The Southern Company brought in the small pox withthem but it has not spread much yet.We are making great preparations for our State fair to beheld in the Deseret store. The awarding committees occupy it tomorrow to adjudge upon the various articles which may bepresented, then it will be open to the public, it would do yoursoul good to go through the building and see what the peoplehave produced in this valleyâit is really a rich treat.Your family are all well. Bathsheba is on one of theawarding committees. George A. works very smart, our peachesgrapes and apples are doing very well this season. All wish to be remembered to you in the office. P. P. Pratt, T. Bullock &company started to the States, the middle of the month.yours truly W. Woodruff 
 Historian's office,G. S. L. City April 1 1857.Elder Orson Pratt,Dear brotherThe Cala. mail for Feby. arrived here March4th. bringing packages containing the pamphlet entitled the "Holy Spirit." The Eastern mail for Oct. and Nov. arrived on the 24th. Ult.bringing packages of your pamphlets entitled "The true faith" "True Re-pentance" and "water baptism," which have been distributed according tothe respective addresses. This mail has been detained during the Winterin the mountains, by the severity of the weather and the unusualdepth of snow. Elder Joseph L. Heywood was with the Mail and suf-fered very much on account of the lack of provisions. They lived onemonth on Hides, boiled and prepared in the best manner they could.It has been reported the snow was very deep on the plains Eastward.There is quite a spirit manifested this Spring through the Territoryin the cultivation of fruit, many are selling out fruit trees of allkinds that can be obtained. There is every prospect for a very fruitfulseason of fruit, grain, and vegetables; the Earth is well saturated fromthe moderate melting of large bodies of snow.The Temple block begins to assume its industrial appearance, &already the huge blocks of rock, are being brought from Red Bute onwhich the sound of the hammer and chisel again are heard.The big cotton wood canal is nearly finished so that we expectwater to be more plentiful in this city, as well as on the farming lands. Theire has been organized a company to raise cotton on the Santa Claraunder the superintendence of bro. I. C. Haight.There is quite a number of parcels of chinese sugar cane here,and many others on the way which will be cultivated with care and 
 to learn that you had prepard for us an account of the mar-tyrdom of the Prophet. I did not learn in what way you intended to forward it to u[s], whether by mail or private conveyance;if by mail I expect we will have it when the Winter mails getin. We have had mu[c]h later news from you and the brethren,through the Mormon, and by letters via California; than wereceived by the last Eastern mail. The Mormon keeps uswell posted up u[p]on matters and things in general in theEast. We can [c]learly see that you have had a strong war-fare upon your hands since your residence in New York, &I believe all your friends in Utah feel that you have ablydefended yourself; and maintained the cause of truth andthat victory has been with you as an able Editor and a champion of rights. I consider the Mormon has been fromthe commencement as a sharp thorn in the side of the enemiesof Zion, and a powerful engine in the defence of the truthand has been an instrument in the hands of God of doing much good.As far as news is concerned with us in Utah I will say that we are having universal health, peace and plentythroughout the Territory so far as I know.Spring has broke in upon us warm and mild, snowhaving disappeared ^in the vallies^; though the mountain and hills still weartheir white mantle, and are deeply clad with snow.The big cottonwood canal is nearly finished and willsoon receive the water for irrigation, and also for canal purposes,by which we will be able to boat the Granite rock from theBig cottonwood kanyon to this city, for building the Temple. 
 forward to me soon. Give my respects to Sister Wight, Orange,and any with whom I am acquainted.We are all well, it is a general time of peace, health andplenty in this Territory at presentânever a better prospect for crops.Our Eastern mail arrived on the 23rd inst. being the quickest trip ever made (25 days) from Independence 1200 miles.We are informed all hell is boiling over against the Mormons.Parly P. Pratt was murdured in Arkansas, by one McLeanâhe wasshotâlived 2 hours. T. B. Marsh is on the way to this placeâwishes to be forgiven and to return to the church again.I wish Brother Wight you would come and pay us a visit.we will all be glad to see you. we have built up a beautiful cityin the valley of the Mountains. Our census makes us about 80,000souls and increasing fastâmormonism is as great a trouble to the world as ever. All the Twelve are now in this country exceptO. Pratt, E. T. Benson, Erastus Snow and John Taylor who are abroadAmasa Lyman and C. C. Rich arrived a short time ago from SanBernardino, and Geo. A. Smith from Washington.I hope you will not fail to write me by the next mailWill you tell me who baptized Wm. E. McLellan and when?My family are all well. I have but one son grown up 17 yearold named Wilford and a good boy. My Father is with meâ80 years oldâis able to work about every day. I baptized him 20years ago, and brought him to this valley. I find the world is much bothered to know what to do with Utah. Brigham, Heberand Orson Hyde are all well.I remember old times we have spent many a good daytogether, and I wish we could spend many more. Mormonism is 
 G. S. L. City Feb. 28 1857Elder Orson PrattDear Bro. The Cala. mail for January arrived hereFeby. 4 having encountered much deep snow. The Eastern mail has notarrived yet.The weather for the last week has been moderately warm; snowdisappearing fast, in many places the ground is now bare, inviting the Plough and the spade of the agricultarist: some have commenced Gardening. Many wards have about finished their labors on the Big Cottonwood canal andthe prospect for water this season is encouraging.Sab. 22 A list of Missionaries for Europe and the islands wascalled off, to which it is anticipated more will be added; there was alsoread a list of names called to accompany Prests. Young & Kimball ontheir Northern trip to Salmon river to start after the April conference.I earnestly desire O. Pratt that you should write out a short sketchof your life for the church History. We have now come in the History compil-ation to the period when Prest. Young with his brethren of the Twelve Presideover the church, and we give a short history of each of the Twelve sayfrom 8 to 12 pages foolscap, which be pleased to forward by return mailas we will in all probability be waiting on it.Say to br. Benson the same will be required of him whenthe history comes up to the date of his ordination.Please also tell br. Phinehas that we want a brief sketch of hislife as we are compiling a short sketch of each one of the Brothers and sistersof bro. Brigham, their families, their missions, and important events in their lives.all these sketches will be required from your birth till Augt. 8 1844 when the history of the church becomes the history of Br. Brigham, and takes all hisbrethren from that date along daily, as Josephs history did. We also wish 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. CitySeptember 30th, 1856.Elder O. PrattDear Brother,As the mail will soon leave, I improve a few moments to keep you advised of matters withus. It is a general time of health and peace throughoutour Territory: all things are going right and prospering.One of the most interesting scenes that was ever witnessed in our Territory was the arrival of two of the Hand CartCompanies, on the 26th inst. Having heard the night previous that they were camped between the two mountains,Presidents Young and Kimball, and many citizens, witha detachment of the Lancers, and the Brass Bands,went out to meet them and escort them into the city. Theymet the companies at the foot of the Little Mountain.Elder E. Ellsworth led the First Company, and Elder DanielD. McArthur, the Second; and after the meeting andsalutations were over, amid feelings which no one candescribe, the escort was formed, a party of Lancers leadingthe advance, followed by the Bands, the Presidency, theMarshal, and Citizens; then came the companies of HandCarts, another party of Lancers bringing up the rear. Bishop Hunter, Capt. L. W. Hardy and myself fell inwith the escort as they entered the city, and I mustsay my feelings were inexpressible: to behold a company- of men, women and children, many of them aged andinfirm, enter the city of the Great Salt Lake, drawing 100 
 Historian's Office, G. S. L. CityNovember 4th 1856Dear Brother O. PrattAlthough it is the 4th of November theEastern mail has not arrived, and thinking the Californiamail would be safer than the Eastern, under McGraw andCo. we write you by it.On the 4th ult. Elders Franklin D. Richards, JosephA. Young, William H. Kimball, George D. Grant, DanielSpencer, John Van Cott, James Ferguson, C. H. Wheelock, N. H. Felt, William C. Dunbar, James McGaw, J. D. T.

 attention by us, we think it will be a benefit to this Territory.The Saints in the various wards in the city have been rebap-tized; the example was set them by the first Presidency: the fruitsof the Reformation has been made manifest throughout this Territoryin many things, among which is a great increase in Tithing grain,which will help to bread the brethren who work at the Temple.There will be a company of Missionaries start for Europe afterconference, and some to the islands. Many have received their ordinancesand blessings in the house of the Lord this Spring; some of the brethrenfrom Iron County and many from the country Settlements.The Board of Directors of the D. A. & M. Society have againpublished their lists of Premiums, amounting to over $1000 besidessilver, medals, and Diplomas, for the encouragement of home man-ufactures, and the production of articles from the native elements.The attention of many in this city and territory has beencalled to the importance of the Sheep raising, and as we have solimited a supply in this Territory, companies are forming to sendto the States for larger supplies; realizing that as a community we cannever attain to that commercial independence necessary to our prosperityand welfare, until we can grow our own wool and cotton and supplythe market with home manufactured cloth. I think we have a fair supply of bread to sustain the inhabitants until another harvest.It is a general time of health and peace throughout this Territoryall is peace with the Indians, Arrowpeene, Kanosh, and many of thechiefs are becoming quite civilized, and using a good influence with theirTribes to promote peace, civilization and industry, in the cultivation of theearth. Arrowpeene made a speech in the tabernacle a short time sinceto a large assembly, and all of his teaching, council, and instruction 
 There are many stone cutters now at work upon theTemple block, and after conference there will be a large addition:it is sweet music to hear the sound of the hammer and chisel in the hands of so many men. we expect to pushthe work of the temple this season.We have every prospect of a very fruitful season. Peaches,apples, Plums, apricots and currants are all loaded with fruitbuds, and some nearly ready to bloom. we have also a fair prospect for Grain as far as we can judge.The past has been a very interesting Winter in Utah tothe Latter day Saints, the inhabitants almost universally haveassembled themselves together in their towns, cities, wards, settle-ments branches and quorums, and spent their Sabbaths and winterevenings in preaching, teaching, prayer and praise unto the Lord;and much of the Holy Spirit has been enjoyed in all theassemblies of the Saints, in every capacity in which they havemet and such a thing as a Ball or party for recreation hashardly been heard of throughout the Territory. The powerof God has rested upon the Presidency, the Twelve, and theElders of Israel and they have been inspired to impart a great amount of teaching, counsel and knowledge unto thepeople, and the fruits of the spirit of God has been visibly manifested among the people; and they have greatly rejoiced in the Lord. I have attended a meeting of some kindalmost every night through the Winter months.The Presidency with many others are preparing tomake a trip to Salmon river settlement this Spring visitingthe Northern branches as they go. 
 Historian's OfficeGreat Salt Lake CitySeptember 30th 1856.Editor of the LuminaryDear Sir,The people throughout thisTerritory are enjoying good health so far as we can learn:there have been a few cases of small pox on Big Cottonwood,but nothing serious.On the morning of the 31st ult. [last month] a fire broke out in thePublic Blacksmith's shop, but was extinguished without doing much damage.On the 10th inst. we moved into our new office, oppositethe President's and Governor's offices; it is a very pleasantlocation, and the building is much more suitably adaptedfor the purpose of compiling history than the one we havepreviously occupiedElders Parley P. Pratt, Thomas Bullock, BernardSnow, Samuel F Neslen, George Gates, and a number ofother missionaries for the States and Europe left on thesame day.I took a trip to the Sugar Works, on the eveningof the 11th and preached to the Saints on the necessityof encouraging Home Manufactures.Elder Preston Thomas arrived in this City fromTexas on the evening of the 12th inst. in advance of hiscompany which arrived on the 16th.During the night of the 19th Brother Lufkin's cabinet

 hand carts, (led by Bro Ellsworth, who assisted in drawing thefirst hand cart,) with which they had travelled some 1400 milesin 9 weeks, and to see them dance with joy as they travelledthrough the Streets, complaining of nothing, only that they hadbeen detained by the ox teams that carried some of their provisions,as they had to wait for them several hours each day, the oxen notbeing able to keep up with them: they say if it had not been for these teams they would have been in ten days sooner. Thissight filled our hearts with joy, and thanksgiving to God: Yesour hearts swelled until we were speechless with joy, and not with sorrow. As I gazed upon the scene, meditating upon the futureresult, it looked to me like the first hoisting of the flood gates ofdeliverance to the oppressed millions; we can now say to thepoor, and honest in heart, Come home to Zion; for the way isprepared. As the companies entered the city, and passed onto the public square, the Streets were thronged with thousandsof people gazing upon the scene, which looked more like thedream of a night vision than a reality. They pitched theirtents upon the Public Square. President Young calledupon the Bishops and people to carry them food whilethey remained there; in a short time we could see loads ofprovisions going to their encampment. There has never beena company enter these vallies that has had the honor andrespect paid to them that the Hand cart companies have;and Elders Ellsworth and McArthur have gained honor andglory In leading these brave companies: they have walked allthe way, and assisted in drawing the hand carts to Zion, and 
 of hand carts, bringing bad news. Through starting solate in the Season, many of them have died; when themessengers arrived at this camp twenty had diedânineteenof them men; and when they left fifty had died. In order to put a stop to so late starting another year, The Presidencytalk of establishing posts along the road, for the storage of provisions &c, viz: at Kearny, Wood River, Laramie, Deer Creek,and Devil's Gate.Altogether about 26,668 lbs of flour, 250 teams, and great quantities of clothing have been sent out to meet theimmigration, and assist them in.The spirit of reformation is still cutting its way throughthe different settlements in these vallies; the saints are begin-ning to wake up to a sense of their duties, and the responsibilitesthey owe to their God. The Presidency are actively engaged in the field, and wield the the arrows of the Almighty with aforce and precision that carry conviction to every heart, andcauses the miners in Zion to tremble, and fearfulness to surprisethe hippocrite. The returned missionaries have been appointed"Home Missionaries," and they also have entered their fieldof labor, which at present is mostly confined to Great Salt LakeCity, and are doing much good.Yours trulyW Woodruff

 would prove a blessing to the Saints, and the whole christian worldshould they follow it. He is a very sensible man, and preachessound doctrine, which is the case with Kanosh the Pauvan [Pahvant] chief, whois learning his tribe to raise their own bread. There are no Indiansin North America who have been so wisely dealt with, kindly treatedas well as fed, and clothed according to the resources at command, or thatare in as propserous a condition for civilization and industry, according to thecircumstances in which they were found as those Indians which come underthe supervision of Governor Young who presides over the Territory ofUtah. For the Indians of this Territory were unlike the Cherokees andmany other Tribes, who had been connected with civilization and white menfor half a century but when Governor Young found them 10 years ago,they had but few of them even seen the face of a white man: butwere sunk to the lowest degree of degradation and misery, that humanbeings were capable of existing under, but the wise and humane policyof Gov. Young has fed, clothed and exalted those degraded beings inthe scale of intelligence, industry and civilization, and bettered their conditionin regard to the world in a manner which has been unequalled in ourday.Yours truly, W.

Rich have arrived fromSan Bernardino, the former with the Cala. mail June 3, the latter onthe 8th with a small Coy. [company] of Saints; subsequently another small companyarrived from San Bernardino, who brought along a seven stopped organ donated to the church by the Australasian Saints; which is being fittedup in the Tabernacle at the North end, by br.

S. pertaining to Utahâher Governorâandthe Saints. Never at any former time have we witnessed a more universalbetter feeling against Mormonism than at the present. Gov.

 shop was destoyed by fire: the amount of damage was estimatedat $15000.A large company of Danes led by Brother Petersonarrived on the 20th.At 9 A.M. of the 26th Presidents Young and Kimball,with the Brass Band, a attachment of the Lancers, and avery large number of the citizens started to meet the 1stand 2nd companies of hand carts, under Elders Edmund Elsworth, and Daniel D. McArthur.  They travelled tothe foot of the little mountain, where they met the companiesand escorted them into the City, where they arrived about5 1/2 P.M. The feelings of the brethren when they metthem cannot be described; their hearts overflowed withgratitude to their heavenly Father that the lives of those faith-ful brethren and sisters had been preserved throughout theirtoilsome journey. There has been less sickness and deathin these companies, than in any ^other^ company that ever crossedthe plains, there being only 7 deaths out of 486 souls.The only complaints we have heard them make is thatthey were detained by a few ox teams in their company;if it had not been for these, they say they would havebeen in some few days sooner, as they had to wait severalhours daily, for these teams to reach their camp.By these companies Elders Edmund Ellsworth, DanielD.

Young and Company on the 26th and the Eastern may mail on the 29th, by which we are happy to announce the safe arrival of Elders Geo. A. Smith, J. M. Bernhisel and T. O. Angel.The weather was cold during the fore part of last month with occasional showers which mostly fell on the mountains aroundthe valley. The frost on the morning of May 9th killed the Beans, Potatoe vines, and injured the fruit blosoms: the weather for the latter part of May has been very warm and dry.Crops are promising throughout the Territory.Water is abundant in the streams, the water sects in the city are overflowing, and the waste water race in North Temple street carries of much surplus water.The health of the inhabitants of the Territory is excellent; and since the opening spring has washed away with the tide of emigration many of the half hearted Saints; the moral elements  feel considerably clearer.Prest. Young gave a short sketch of his late tour on the stand yesterday, said he had heard much concerning the countryNorthward; but all he had heard had failed to impress his mind with a correct idea of the sterrility, barrenness, mountainous and broken condition of the country: the company travelled 762 miles in 1 monthand 2 days, had a laborious journey, which however was rendered agreeable by the unanimity, harmony and good feelings manifested. 
 they have healed the sick, and strengthened the weak, bynight and by day, and when those worthy elders entered theCity, they remained at the head of their companies coveredwith dust, drawing a hand cart like the rest of their bretheren.Elder Ellsworth, while passing his own house, and seeing hiswives and children standing in the door did not stop to speakto them, but only saluted them while passing, and remained with his company until they were encamped and fed.There were but seven deaths in Elder Ellsworth's company,and less in McArthur's, during the whole journey, althoughmany were aged, and feeble; women and children havedrawn hand carts all the way. No oxen that could beput upon the road could keep up with them.President Young has been sanguine from the beginning,that it was a safe and practical enterprize, and it has nowbeen proven to be so; and I feel that we can say to the saintsin all the world, Let your hearts be comforted, have faith and trust in God, call upon him in mighty prayer, befaithful, and follow the counsel of the servants of God, andlay up all that you can to help you over the sea, and yourdeliverance is nigh, even at the door.The Presidency of the Church have commenced a great reformation among this people in the vallies of the mountains. I have never heard as strong sermons del-ivered to the people, as have been preached unto them of late. The Presidency are weighing the people in the balanceand are calling upon them to repent and be baptized for the 
 Ed. of Mill. StarG. S. L. City apl. 30 1857Dear Sir,April 6, 7, 8 & 9 was the 27th annual conference held by the church of Jesus Christ of L. D. S. and one of the most interesting I ever attended.The teachings of the First Presidency were rich indeedâpointing out the onward course of Israel, and urging upon the Saints to lay up grain against the days of famine.There were 11 missionaries appointed to the U. S., 13 to the Sandwich Isles, 33 to Europe, 22 to Canada and 2 to California.One very interesting scene transpired at the close of the conference: the sons of the Prophets and apostles were called up on the stand, and to speak before the assembled people. Their wordswere few but generally well ordered. Amongst the number were JosephA. & Brigham Young Jr. William H. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt Jr., OrsonPratt Jr., and Heber John RichardsIn some wards in the city most of the young men have been ordained and set to work in the Priesthood as Teachers & Deacons.The weather for the past month has been very dry, and irrigating has been resorted to, to start the Spring crops.34 brethren were selected this Spring to make a settlement on the Rio Virgin for raising cotton; and over 100 have

Rich arrived in good health and spirits, with a small company.June 12th. A few brethren arrived from San Bernandino, bring-ing the seven stopped organ donated to the church by the Australasian Saints, which was left at San Bernardino, and has been forwarded by the generosity of the brethren there to this point. Br. Joseph Ridges who made the organ is fitting it up in the Tabernacle, at the North end; and when the weather is cool, and the congregation resume meeting in the Taberna-cle it will be a soul stirring accompaniment to the choir.By the arrival of the May mail we learned of the agitation of the public press in the U. S. pertaining to Utah,âher Governorâ and the Saints. Never at any former time have we witnessed a more universal bitter feeling against Mormonism than at the present. Gov. Young thinking the working bees of Utah would not take time to readwhat the public press say, in relation to them and himself, set apart Sab. June 14th at 8 a.m. to have some of the most rabid articles read to the Saints ^in this city^, and had two of our best readers employed for the occasion. The forenoon from 8 to 12 was nearly all taken up in hearing the loathsome hash which the corrupt press of the U. S. has given birth to. It was indeed novel however to hear the Governor propose such articles to be read; seeing; they were mostly aimed at his private and public character; but this only shows the consciousness he possesses of the rectitude of the path which he pursues, and the confidence he has in the people whom he leads. 
 seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much asthey have done the past winter. I hope it will continue. the powerof God has been with in preaching and teaching in all the Quorumand Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died,and after his death the burthen [burden] of the care of the Missionariesrested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards; who was unwell consid-erable but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Stydehave been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelv(except myself) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summerTrip North to Salmon river.This Spring A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us aboutthe first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, somemissionaries will be called to Europe and to the islands. President Young would like to send a mission to Siberia and the Japan-ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene andKanosh with other chiefs, are making great improvement. Arrow-peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, itwas good.We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or1200 lbs,; it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected.a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going totry the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territorysome are going to California this Spring, several in the Southernsettlements have started on the short road, or cut off to go thereand no doubt some others will follow them soon. Your family are all well, you and the brethren associated with you are

 the Saints in this city & vicinity, and had two of our best readers employed for the occasion, who read alternately from 8 till nearly noonthe loathsome hash which the corrupt press of the U. S. had givenbirth to. It was indeed novel however to hear the Governor proposesuch articles to be read; seeing they were mostly aimed at his pri-vate and public character: this however only shews the consciousnesshe possesses of the rectitude of the path which he heads, and the confidencehe has in the people whom he leads.June 16th. Teams re-commence hauling rock for the Temple, operationhaving been suspended in that department for a few days in consequen[ce]of the church selling many of their cattle to cancel church obligations, butthe Saints having the privilege of turning in stock to help defray these liabilities, contributed so liberally that but a few days elapsed before thechurch had as many cattle as before, and not any who donated have beenhindred in their business, nor have felt any the poorer in consequence oftheir liberality; and thus the Saints have witnessed to God and his ser-vants that the Spirit of the Reformation lives in their hearts, and bringsforth fruit in their lives, and therefore Prest.

 Historians officeG. S. L. City June 1 1857Ed. of MormonDr Sir,The May mail which left Independence on the 1st, arrived here on the afternoon of the 29th Ulto. conducted by John Murdock and O. P. Rockwell; bringing all the mail matter left on the way since last November.Hons. Geo. A. Smith, J. M. Bernhisel and Elder Truman O. Angel arrived with the mail in good health and spirits; notwithstandingthe fatigues of the journey, which was rendered very laborious on account of the scarcity, and in some parts almost entire absence of feed onthe route.The weather was cold during the fore part of last monthwith occasional showers which mostly fell on the mountains around the valley. The frost on the morning of May 9 killed the Beans, Potatoe vines and injured the fruit blosoms: the latter part of May has been very [war]m and dry.The water is abundant: water sects in the city are full and overflowing.Crops are very promising throughout the Territory.During the absence of Prest. Young and company North, the News has been ably edited by Judge Elias Smith, from which you willlearn of the prosecution and completion of much public improvement in and around the Temple block, Council house and Governors residence. The same spirit of public improvement is manifested through the city; and in many places throughout the Territory.May 26 Gov. Young and party arrived having been gone one month and two days, travelled 762 miles, had a laborious, but 
 G. S. L. city May 1 1857Editor of the MormonDear Sir,The weather for the past month has beenvery dry, and generally warm. The health of the inhabitants ofthe city is excellent.The past conference was very interesting. The teachings of the First Presidency were appropriate and seasonable: 33 missionaries were sent to Europe, 22 to Canada, 13 to the Sandwich Isles, 11 to the U. S., and 2 to California.A great many have been called to go on the road between here and the States; some to make settlements, others to engage in the service of the Express and carrying coy.Quite a number have left these vallies, and are returning to the States, and others to California.Since the arrival of bros Ellsworth and McArthur last fall with the hand cart companys, hand carts have become popular; inso-much that the Missionaries for Europe Canada and the States have substituted the hand carts, and are now travelling en route for the states by that method of conveyance: 23rd. Ulto. was the day appointed for their starting, which created an unparralleled excite-ment in the starting of Missionaries from these vallies. Appropriate addresses were delivered by Elders Hyde, Woodruff, L. Snow & others: 
 remission of their sins.President Grant has gone into the North counties,and is preaching and baptizing whole wards, and buildingup Churches. I presume the same course will be pursuedin the wards in this city. The people begin to feel morethan ever that they are dealing with the spirit and power ofGod, and the Holy Priesthood. Yes the Latter Day Saintsbegin to feel that they are dealing with a spirit that can reach the hearts, know the thoughts and intents thereof, andtry the souls of men. The people are called to sanctifythemselves before the Lord, that we may be prepared for thework of our God.Elder P. P. Pratt, in company with the Eastern MissionariesStarted on the 10th inst.We are making great preparations for our Home Manufacturingand Agricultural State fair, which is to be held in the Deseret Store.The awarding committees occupy it tomorrow to award premiums,after which it will be open to the public. It would do your soul goodto walk through the building and see the products of Utah whichare there gathered together; it is certainly far beyond my expectation.A full account will be published oin the Deseret News.The California Mail arrived to day: I received a letter fromElder C. C. Rich, of San Bernardinoâall well in that place.We are having a favorable fall for all kinds of labor, exceptit is dryâwe need rain.Oure early frosts damaged late corn very much. Some aresowing their fall wheat. Wheat is again selling from $1 to $1.50per bushel, notwithstanding we have just passed through a famine.Your family, and the families of all our brethren in Englandare well so far as I know.Remember me to Elder Benson and all our friends. Yours truly,W Woodruff 
 been called to make settlements between here and the States, and to engage in the express coy.Quite a number have left and are leaving this Spring for California and the U. S. amongst the number are Judge Stiles and T. S. Williams.The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society have published their lists of Premiums for the year 1857 amounting to $1470, 253 Diplomas and 5 silver medals: this will be a great incentive to home Manufacturers, Stock raisers, Farmers, Mechanics &c, and tend to facilitate our commercial independence.April 25 The Missionaries for Europe, Canada, and the States started with their hand carts; it was a soul inspiring sightand called forth more interest among the citizens, than the starting of any missionaries from these vallies. Elders Hyde, Woodruff, L.Snow and others addressed the missionaries and the concourse assembledon the occasion24th. A little before sun up Prests. Young, Kimball& Wells started up for Salmon river on their northern trip, and during the day, the company mostly left the city.yours truly W. Woodruff 
 June 16th. Teams re-commence hauling rock for the Temple, operations having been suspended in that department for a few days in consequence of the church selling many of their cattle to cancel P. E. Fund obligations &cbut the Saints having the privilege of turning in stock to help defray these liabilities, contributed so liberally that but a few days elapsed before the church had as many cattle as before, and not any who donated have been hindred in their business, nor have felt any the poorer in consequence of their liberality; and thus the Saints have witnessed to God and his servants that the spirit of the Reformation still lives in their hearts, and brings forth fruit in their lives, and therefore Prest. Young frequently of late has said this is a "God blessed people."The Eastern June mail arrived on the 23rdâ23 days from Independenceâthe shortest trip ever made by the mail; by which Elders Ferramore Little and Ephraim Hanks arrived. This mail brought us several papers containing an account of the massacre of Elder P. P. Pratt.June 27th. The Nauvoo Legion held a general muster in the Great Salt Lake, and San Pete military districts, entered into a new organ-ization, in consonance with the late enactments of the Legislature. It is perhaps worthy of note that this new organization was entered into on the 27th June the day on which the Prophets were massacred in Carthage Jail 13 years ago.Crops are abundant, harvest is about to commence in this county, and the harvest being so great it will truly be an applicablesaying in a few days "the laborers are few."Love to br. Benson ^appleby^ and all the Elders of my acquaintance associated with you.W. Woodruff 
 G. S. L. City 30 Sep. 1856Editor of the MormonDr Sir,The hand cart company's of Saints underElders Ed. Ellsworth and D. D. McArthur arrived here on theevening of Friday Sep. 26 Inst. having been about 9 weeks from Florence,to this point; the few ox teams and wagons they had along, retardedtheir progress considerably, not being able to keep up with them.Prests. B. Young, and H. C. Kimball with a detachment of Lancers, the Brass band, and many citizens went up into the Kanyon tomeet the companies.  The feelings which the Brethren had on meetingthem I will not attempt to pourtray, to behold a company of menwomen and children amounting to nearly 500 souls, drawing 486 100 handcarts, entering into the city of Great Salt Lake, dancing with joy asthey passed along, only complaining that they had been encumbered witha few ox teams for which they had to wait several hours almostdaily, otherwise they would have been with us ten days sooner, andthen to realize that this company had walked some 1400 miles,drawing their hand carts the whole distance; these things presentedto our eyes, at the same time reflecting upon the future resultsâ filledour hearts with joy unspeakable, and caused our bosoms to swell with thanksgiving to God. we felt that the flood gate of deliverancewas hoisted to the oppressed millions, and we could say in confidenceto the poor and honest in heart "come home to Zion," for the way isopened up. Prest. Kimball said his heart felt as big as a two bushelbasket, yes our hearts were so swollen that we were speechless notwith sorrow, but with joy. Elders Ellsworth and McArthur haveearned honor and glory to themselves in the leading of these companies 
 otherwise pleasant journey: remained with the settlement at Salmon river 4 days where the brethren have made much improvement, and have sown 120 Bushels of seed Wheat this spring.Elder A. O. Smoot and Company start with the June mail, he takes men enough along to make a mail station at Deer Creek, to preserve the animals from Indian depredations. Several companieshave gone out this spring to make mail stations on the route.Many teams are constantly engaged hauling rock for the Temple and a company of stone cutters have been sent to Big Cotton woodkanyon, to cut the rock preparatory to boating it for this point.The health of the inhabitants of the Territory is excellent; and, since the opening spring has washed away with the tide of emigration, many of the half hearted Saints; the moral elements feel considerably clearer.Geo. A. has just stepped in, and hearing we were writing to you says tell the Editor I am glad to be at home and have the privilege of walking our streets once more.yours truly W. Woodruff

Elder Bank'scompany from St. Louis, and Elder Bunker's hand cart companieshave arrived this week.On the 26th Ulto. the hand cart company's of Elders EdmundEllsworth and D. D. McArthur arrived with about 100 hand carts and 486souls. The kindly welcome and benevolent reception these Pioneer hand cartcompanies received exceeded greatly that of any other company since our ar-rival in the mountains.On 20th Sep. Ulto Elder Peterson's company of Danes arrived.Elder Preston Thomas arrived from Texas on the evening of12th inst. in advance of his company which arrived on the 16thThe health of the people generally is firstrate.The Weather has been very fine this last month, which has beenvery favorable for public improvements.The Deseret State Fair closes to day. This has been a display of talent genius and industry which does honor to our citizens,indeed we feel proud of our associations with a people, who altho' hem-med in by mountains living on desert plains, accounted unworthy theabode of civilization, have made mother earth team luxuriantly withthe comfortsâthe bountiesâyea the luxuries of life, and we can indorsethe sentiment of the Prophet, when he declared the desert shouldblossom as the rose [##Isaiah 35:1##], and the barren waste should be converted intoa fruitful field [##Isaiah 32:15##].On the 10th Ulto we moved into the new Historian office 
 the lands and a large concourse of citizens conveyed them on to the bench and witnessed their departure. The Presidency organized them towards the mouth of the kanyon.April 24th. Gov. Young, Hon. H. C. Kimball & Gen. D. H. Wells started before sunrise, and the balance of the company during the day on their tour to Salmon river and the Northern country.The Sabbath school children from the various wards organ-ized for a May walk this morning, and promenaded on the bench, and in city creek kanyon, gathering flowers and branches with green foliage, under the superintendence of their respective Directors; andabout 2 p. m, met in the 14th Ward, where they formed a line and with their appropriate banners and devices, walked through the principal streets and pasted the Governors residence, then proceeded to the Tabernacle at 4 where their parents were invited and I delivered them an address. The brass band accompanied them, and with their soul inspiring music added interest to the interesting spectacle.yours trulyW. Woodruff 
 Historian's office.G. S. L. City May 5 1857Ed. of Western StandardDear Sir,The California Mail arrived on the 2ndinst., bringing files of the Standard, which as usual is very interesting.During the 6, 7, 8 & 9 days of the past month we held our 27thannual conference, which has been a very interesting and important oc-casion. There were 33 Missionaries appointed to Europe, 22 to Canada 13 to the Sandwich isles, 11 to the U. S., and 2 to Calafornia.We were favored with rich teachings from the First Presidency. The objects and interests of the Express and Carrying Company were laid before the people; showing the advantages that would accrue to gathering Israel when a high way was cast up, settlements made at every feasable point, and a thoroughfare established so that the Saints could come home. The necessity of laying up grain against the days of famine and want was urged upon the Saints.Thirty four brethren were selected this spring to make a settle-ment on the Rio Virgin for raising cotton; and over one hundred have been called to make settlements between here and the States, and to engage in the Express Coy.Judge Styles, T. S. Williams and many others are leaving this spring for the States, not being able to find out here, whether mormon-ism is true or not.The weather for the past month has been very dry, still crops are looking well; Dews are becoming more prevalent in this country.april 23rdâThe missionaries for Europe, Canada and the States started with hand carts, as another ensample to the Saints scat-tered abroad of the feasibility of that method of gathering: there was 
 Historian's officeG. S. L. City Nov 5, 1856Ed. of the Western StandardDear BrotherThe Weather has been very cold and some-what stormy for the past month, but at the present more open & mild.On the arrival of Elders D. Spencer, F. D. Richards and companyat this place, Prest. Young learned the exact situation of the Emigration,at the dates the brethren passed the several camps; and although muchhelp in Teams and Flour had been sent out early in the season,the President made it the first item of business before the conference toraise Flour, Teams, Wagons, Teamsters, Blankets and clothing to sendto them: to this call there was a very liberal response. Subsequent callshave been made, and it is now believed there has in the neighborhoodof 250 Teams gone out, and at the conference call alone there was26,688 lbs of flour sent, so you perceive this seasons emigrationcomes tolerably heavy on those of our brethren who are always on handto help Israel.The best news from this place is the reformation whichis abroad in the Territory. you may consider that reformation is nonew thing in Israel, that as a people we have always been reforming or trying to do so; but let me assure you that reformation hasbegan in solemn earnest. The humble and faithful are waking up,repenting of their sins, making restitution where they have wronged,and preparing for the waters of baptism determined from henceforthin the strength of Israels God to serve him, and keep his commandments. The reformation is the all absorbing topic here to those whowant to do right, and as a matter of course the greatest thornto those who do not, that has yet troubled them in Israel.

I could not give informationwhether the proper time of sowing should be Spring or Fall. I alsoenclose a few service berries where the bush is calculated it producestwo crops each season.During the summer I will dry carefully some of our bestmountain currants of each kind & service berry and forward to you, orany other native seeds which I think may be of any worth to you. someof our native currants bear a remarkable good berry both for size andflavor as large as the English black cherry. I am satisfied thatUtah will prove a good fruit growing country. Aprictots and Peaches 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF was the next speaker. He alluded to the departure from the true order of the gospel by professing Christians. It was almost impossible for them to believethat continued revelation from the Al-mighty was necessary. The faith of the Latter-day Saints, however, was that it is God's right to rule and dictate by revelation. The law of tithing was given by revelation, and no Saint could neglect to comply with it and retain the spirit of the gospel. It was the duty of all to assist in building templesin which to attend to ordinance per-taining to the living and the dead. None of the requirements of the gospelwould fall to the ground, for all must be fulfilled. The speaker exhorted the people to draw near to the Lord, that he might draw near to them, and that they might be filled with the light of truth. He also bore testimony to the greatness and the divine nature of the latter-day work. 
 ELDER W. WOODRUFF said: Imet in this house when it was dedi-cated to the Lord and I was very gladto see a house built after the Prysby-terian style, filled by prophets and apostles; it being the first that was builtby the Latter-day Saints; I feel so to-day to meet with so many of the Saintsto worship the Lord our God; I havelistened with a great deal of attentionto the teachings of yesterday by the servants of God; for a long time I havethought and asked myself the questionwhere are the Saints drifting to; I saw and realized that a change was neces-sary to save the people; I have medit-ated upon the condition of our countryand of our nation that is fast goingdown, therefore the Lord is callingupon his people to unite, and you andI live in the dispensation of the fullnessof times; it is the greatest that has ever been upon the earth, for it will gatherall things into one and the principlesthat have been laid before you bybrother Snow and Cannon will preparethe hearts of people to receive the truthand prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man; what did the world know about the gospel of Jesus Christfor the last 1,700 years, until God calledJoseph Smith in his youth, raised himup and educated and prepared him tolay the foundation of this great and mighty work, and offer to the worldtruth, the principles of life and salva-tion; Luther and others were called tointroduce principles of liberty and theydone good work for many years, andin process of time Columbus discover-ed America, and our puritan forefa-thers who came over in the Mayflower,and the Declaration of Independenceand the Constitution that was framed by our forefathers when they met inPhiladelphia; we acknowledge that the hand of God was in all this to pre-pare the way for the gospel, and Jo-seph Smith was inspired of God andwe are well acquainted with him, wehave traveled with him, eat and sleptwith him and knew him well, and know what he passed through and en-dured until his blood was shed; Jo-seph lived long enough to establishthis work and before his death he com-mitted the keys of the kingdom to hisbrethren, and he has gone to preach tothe spirits in prison that have diedsince the days of Jesus and his Apos-tles, and he has organized the churchthere the same as he did here. Pres-ident Young has brought us herewhere no marks had been made by anyof the Anglo-Saxon race after we weredriven from our homes; we as Latter-day Saints have got to unite and do the will of the Lord, build temples to hisholy name and receive the blessings ofthe Lord and assist in the fulfillmentof the revelations of God, for Babylonis nearly ripe for destruction, for Godwill cut his work short in righteous-ness; the nation has rejected this workas a general thing; this is the work of God and He will defend his people;the revelations say, woe to that people or nation that shall lift up their arms against the Lord's anointed, for they will be destroyed, and on whomsoeverthe little stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands shall fallupon it will grind them to powder.Let us unite for the defense of Zion,for it is worth more than we possess togain eternal life; let us remember Geo.Q. Cannon, who is in the halls of Con-gress in Washington, in our prayers,that God may sustain him, and if thesaints unite and be faithful we shallcome off triumphant from this timehenceforth and forever, which may God grant for Christ's sake, amen. 
 they have like the people walked all the way and assisted in drawing the hand carts. Brother Ellsworth went through the citycovered with dust at the head of his brave company drawing ahand cart, under the close scrutiny of the thousands who crowdedthe streets with weeping eyes to gaze upon the scene; as he passedby his own lovely home and saw his wives and children standing in his doorhe made no halt, only gave a passing salute, continuing with his companyuntil he reached the public square and saw them all comfortably encamped and fed. I felt that his position was far more honorable and lovelyin the eyes of God and Angels and good men, than it would havebeen had he been mounted upon the best steed that ever had theearth clothed with ermine and gold. Prest. Young has declared fromthe beginning that it was a practical safe operation his sayings inthis, as in all other cases have proven here, he lost but seven out of hiscompany a smaller number than almost any company that have arrived herecontaining as many souls. Many were aged and infirm, yet they out-travelledany ox teams that could be started on the road; never has a companybeen so highly honored, so numerously worked, or so kindly dealt withsince Israel has arrived in these mountains, as the Pioneer hand cartcompanies.The Deseret State Fair is opened for the reception of articles forexhibition, and from the universal spirit of encouragement to domesticmanufactures, we anticipate our Fair will be an emporium of Utah's truewealth which will astonish her own citizens, further particulars by nextmail.There is a reformation commenced here among this people bythe authorities of the church, such an one as we trust will be 
 The first speaker wasAPOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF."We are again called to assemblehere to pay our last respects to one of God's noblemen. We have lyingbefore us the tabernacle of President Joseph Young. It is said that he isdead. I suppose he is as we use theterm death. His tabernacle lies here in this casket, but Uncle Jo-seph is not there! We call him "Uncle" because he has been related to almost all the Holy Priesthood of Israel from the organizationof this Church. I ask BrotherLorenzo Young and Bro. Young's wives and his sons and daughters, if they feel to mourn in their heartsto-day? If they do, I do not; if they do, President Joseph Young does not; for it was one of the most glo-rious moments of his existence, whe-ther in time or in eternity, when heopened his eyes in the spirit world and struck hands with Joseph Smith, with Brigham Young, with his father's house, and with the El-ders of Israel with whom he hasbeen associated here on the earthmore or less for the last 50 ye[a]rs ofhis life. If Bro. Joseph ever felt while in the flesh to shout, glory, hallelujah! he did so when this newbirth took place. Now these are some of the sentiments of myheart. I cannot mourn when I fol-low to the grave a man like Joseph Young; I have never been able to doit since I have been a member ofthe Church, when I havo followed a true, faithful, Latter-day Saintto the grave. Death was a gloomy subject to me before I heard the gospel of Jesus Christ. It was sadto see the bodies of men and womenlaid away in the tomb. I did notknow where they came from, why they were here, where they were going. It was taking, as it were, a leap in the dark. But, thank God, the blood of Christhas burst the bonds of death, given us power in the resurrection, andthe gospel of Jesus Christ has point-ed out to us the blessings, the glory and the privileges that we can en-joy in this world and in the worldto come. Death has lost its gloom with me, with the Latter-day Saints.I do not know whether the spirit of Brother Joseph is watching over us to-day, seeing this funeral, hearing us talk upon this subject, or whetherin the eternal world his joy is sogreat that he will say in his ownmind to those that are left be-hind, "bury my body, I have got something else to do."I do not know that this is the case,God has not revealed it to me; but one thing I can say from the very depth of my heart, and that is, I rejoice and thank God that I hadthe privilege of becoming acquaint-ed with such a man as President Joseph Young and of being associat-ed with him in the flesh for nearly50 years. His life is before me andyou, it has been before the heavens and the earth. A purer man, amore virtuous man, a more honestman, according to the light and knowledge God bestowed upon him,I do not know that we have in our midst. "Blessed are the dead thatdie in the Lord, yea, saith the Spiritfrom henceforth, for they rest fromtheir labors and their works do fol-low them." We have death herein this world. We attend funerals;our friends, our fathers, our moth-ers, our brethren, our sisters, our children die; we mourn over them in a measure; we follow themto the grave; but do you compre-hend and understand that when we have such a death as this here,there is a birth on the other side of thevail? Don't you think that Sarah, when she received Isaac, rejoiced atthe birth of her son? [##Genesis 21:1-7##] Yes, she did,and so have all the mothers inIsrael who comprehend the value ofoffspring. Now, whether there was any mourning in the spirit worldwhen Isaac left, I do not know. I should think not, for those therewould fully comprehend the value of spirits taking tabernacles on theearth. But here we have a death,a funeral. Well, if you could see the vail lifted up, and behold Uncle Jo-seph, the old patriarch, who haslived 84 years in the flesh, and morethan half of his life in theChurch and Kingdom of God,do you think you would see much mourning there? No you would not. Brother Joseph Young is re-joicing with Brother Joseph Smithand his brethren the Elders of Israel,and we certainly should rejoice onthis occasion, when we are payingour respects to a man that has beenfaithful during these great manyyears, faithful to his God, faithful to his family, faithful to his quo-rum, faithful to the Church andkingdom of God and to his coven-ants. Brother Joseph has finished his work here in the flesh and gone into the presence of God and the Lamb, and we have the hope and consolation that this man will in-herit eternal life and come forth in the morning of the first resurrection. That same tabernacle which Uncle Joseph has occupied for over 84 years will come forth again, and he will be crowned with principalities andpowers, and be made an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus Christ to all the blessings that God himself possesses. Can you mourn? I can-not. I wish I might live as good alife and receive as good a glory and exaltation as I am satisfied BrotherJoseph Young will obtain. He has lived to a great age. My first ac-quaintance with him was in 1834, in Kirtland. I traveled with him in Zion's Camp a thousand miles, led by President Joseph Smith; with Brother Brigham and many othersfrom whom the Lord afterwardschose the first quoroum of the TwelveApostles, of whom Brother Pratt and myself are the only ones now alive. I always rejoiced in the society of Brother Young. He is from a noble family, and perhapsit is my duty here to say something with regard to his father. I made a remark in some of my public dis-courses that Father Joseph Smith was the first Patriarch ordained in this Church and Kingdom. I should have been more explicit in this matter. The father of Joseph Young and Brigham Young was the first ordained Patriarch in this generation, but he was ordained as Patriarch of his own family, he did not officiate as the Patriarch of the Church, as Father Joseph Smith did up to the day of his death. I wished to make these remarks be-cause I consider they are just andright.Well, now, what shall I say to you with regard to Bro. Joseph Young?  You are acquainted with him, he has been in your midst. He was ordained the First President of the Seventies in 1835. He has held that office from that time up to the day of his death, and he will hold that position and the keys of that posi-tion after death and after the resur-rection. Not only so, but he will occupy a place as a king and priestto the Most High God, ruling and reigning in the house of Israel forever.I want to say to the sons and daughters of Brother Joseph Young, follow your father as he has follow-ed Christ and you will rejoice in the eternal worlds with him. He has been a good father to you, a good husband, and a good counselornot only to his family but to the Church and Kingdom of God. He has been associated with these sevenPresidents of the first quorum of Seventies. There are but few of those living to-day, and are here remaining who were ordained the same time that he was. He was or-dained a Patriarch under the hands and direction of his brother Brig-ham in the Endowment House a few years go. He has held that office from that day to this; and his tabernacle will lie in the tomb but a very short time until it will burst the bonds of death and come forth out of the grave, and that spirit that to day is rejoicing in the spirit world will again return to the same house. I am glad of that. I rejoice in that principle that we can again haveour bodies in which we have traveledon foot, without money and without reward, for many thousands of milesto preach the gospel, in which we have labored in weariness and hun-[g]er and thirst to perform this labor. Now this is a great conso-lation to me that this same house that our spirits dwell in to-day, we can have in the morning of the resurrection. This will be the case with Prest. Joseph Young, who lies here before us to-day. I was very much pleased in looking upon his face, so natural, so pleasant, so life-like in one sense of the word, it looks as though he went to sleep and was happy. His tabernacle shows, as it were, the happiness of his spirit when it departed.Brother Joseph's history has been of interest to us. He has magnified his calling, he has been true and faithful in all his days. Before he was a member of this Church he was a Methodist preacher. He taught the gospel according to the best light and knowledge he had. But when he had the Gospel carried to him by his brother, he embraced it, and it is said he never laughed in his life until he embraced our religion. When he was a Metho-dist preacher he was always gloomy and sober, very seldom smiled, but when he embraced the true gospelit is said he laughed for six months,he was so overjoyed to think tha[upside-down text]t[end of upside-down text]he had found out the truth. Well, I will promise you he is happy to-day, and he will see no more sorrow.  I rejoice when I see a man who is true and faithful to the gospel, to the Priesthood, to his calling and covenants before God, I can tell you the heavens rejoice over him, the angels rejoice over him, and why should not we?I am pleased to have the privilege of making a few remarks on this oc-casion. I do not, however, wish to detain you, as there are others of my brethren who will speak. But I thank God that we have the privi-lege of paying our last respects to our departed brother. His body willnow be laid away in the tomb, but by and by it will come forth and be glorified.I pray God my Eternal Father to let his blessing rest upon us; that his spirit may rest upon Bro. Lorenzo, and upon the wives, sons and daughters and friends of the deceased; that we may all of us take the admonitionâfor all these things are admonitions, to live faithful like unto our departed brother for "the night will come when no man can work." I have a desire myself to do good. I cannot remain here long. Many of my brethren have gone henceâBrigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, George A. Smith, P. P. Pratt, and now President Jo-seph Young. Many of my brethrenwho went with that Camp havegone henceâBrigham Young, He-ber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, GeorgeA. Smith, Parley P. Pratt, andnow President Joseph Young.And there are but few of us left.  How long we shall tarry here, I do not know, but while I live I want to do what good I can.  I tell you it is a glorious blessing for men to receive the Priesthood ofGod, and to be called of God topreach the gospel. The old pro-phets and patriarchs are watching over us. They are anxious to see us perform our work. Brother Joseph came to me a few weeks since and talked about his death. He wanted to finish up his records before he left. He wished to do what he could for his dead while he was in the flesh. Well, I told him I rejoiced that he was looking after these things. But now, if he has left any-thing undone, his brother Lorenzo or his family will attend to the matter, as we have all got to do what we can to save both the living and the dead.May God bless us all, and give uspower to finish our work, to be true and faithful unto death, that we may gain eternal life, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 
 Apostle Woodruff said, it is im-portant that the Saints should knowthe position they occupy, and their future destiny. Read from the rev-elation called "##Doctrine and Covenants 76|The Vision##," also the##Revelation 5|5th chapter## of John's revelations.Said that the Savior while on earthwas very poor, as far as the wealth of the world was concerned, as an evidence, when called upon to pay [t]axes, he had to send Peter to catcha fish, from which to obtain the money. No man who ever lived can say he descended lower than the Savior did. Spoke upon the variety that is seen upon the earth and among men, showing that each hashis own identity, which he will re-tain to all eternity, and that God in all dispensations has had spirits uponthe earth to work with. If the eyes of the Elders were opened they would never set their hearts upon the things of this world. We sh[a]ll build these Temples because God has decreed it. The Savior is watch-ing over us and will continue to do so until his second coming. Go[d]has decreed that Zion shall not be moved out of her place, but if we transgress we shall be chastised.  Wished to say to the young it is theirduty to get married, but not to get themselves into a condition to be obliged to marry or they would reap sorrow. The spirits that have been reserved will be born in spite of all the laws to the contrary. Said that Zion would never go backward, andthe curse of God would rest upon those who apostatize after having partaken of the blessings promised.Those of the daughters of Zion who have been legally married have a right to bear the souls of men, and though they know it not, many of the rising generation will never taste death, but will be changed in amoment. It will require great faith to stand in the midst of the judg-ments of God. 
 quite an excitement in the city on the occasion: large crowds ofcitizens assembled to see them start: Elders Hyde, Woodruff, L. Snow &Claiton addressed the people & the Missionaries: the brass band escorted them through the city.april 24âThe Presidency & Coy. for Salmon river and the Northern Settlements started.The Sabbath school children had a may day walk on the 1st inst.âpromenaded through the streets, and at 4 p.m. met in the Tabernacle, where there parents were also invited. I had the pleasure of delivering them an address, & felt the occasion and felt it was one of no ordinary character,  I understand the address appears in the News. All is quiet, peace and health, in our Territory so far as I know.yours truly, W. Woodruff

 PRESIDENT W. WOODRUFF re-ferred to the present prosperous cir-cumstances of the people, as com-pared with those which surroundedthem immediately after the settle-ment of these valleys. He observedwith interest and satisfaction the in-crease of the population and settle-ments throughout the Territory.Zion was being rapidly built up. Itshould be remembered however thatthe angels and our dead are watching us and our labors. The speaker hada great anxiety to see the Latter-daySaints manifest to their works a de-sire to build up the Kingdom of God in view of fulfilling all that had been spoken and written to reference tothe redemption of the living and thedead. He referred to the progressbeing made in the building of theSalt Lake temple, and observed that it would, at the rate of progress nowbeing made, be three years yet be-fore the walls were built to thesquare. It should be remembered,he said, by the Saints that their ob-ject in coming here was not to makethemselves rich in the things of theworld, but to build up the Lord's Kingdom. He admonished all toobey the commandments of God, and then we shall satisfy ourselves,our Father in Heaven, and ourfriends in the spirit world with thework we have performed on the earth. The speaker prayed that the spirit of the Lord might rest uponthe congregations assembled duringthis Conference, so that the servants of the Lord would be able to profitablyinstruct those who came to hear. 
 On the 31st October, brother Gideon D. Gibbs and HoraceNewell arrived from Elder Willie's hand cart Coy., whom they left onthe sweetwater, when the teams sent out at Conference arrived atthis camp, there had been twenty deaths, nineteen of them men.and while with them in one day there were fifteen burials, and whenthe messengers left there had been fifty deaths. They did not seemto be sick, but chilled through, men would dig graves for theirbrethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed their last rations of Flour the night before the brethren met themand they did not know that any relief was at hand.The reason of this difficulty and suffering [ink faded] with theemigration is in consequence of the companies starting so late, and the early falling of snow in the mountains. Prest. Young hasuniversally given counsel for the emigration to start early.The hand cart companies who started early came in well indeedbetter than the most sanguine could have expected.yours truly.W.

 permanent. The preaching of the First Presidency has been soultirring indeed. We may safely say in a measure that such sermonswere never heard before, as have been delivered unto us of late by theprophet of God, and they are weighing the people, and the people feelthat they are dealing with the quickening spirit and power ofGod which discerns and knows their hearts and they feel the importanceof repentance and baptism for the remission of sins and leading holylives before God that we may be prepared for the events which awaitthe whole earth. In some of the settlements in Davis County everyone has gone forward and been re-baptized, and we anticipate thesame results will follow in G. S. L. County.Sep 20. Elder Peterson's company of Danes arrived.Elder S. M. Blair and company returned from exploring aroute to Carson valley, report no feasible route westward. Hon. E. Reesearrived from Carson with the same report.The weather has continued fine and must of the corn notinjured by early Frosts will have time to mature.On the 10th inst we moved into our new office oppositePrest.

 opposite Prest. Young's buildings.On the 29th. Ult we had a general muster and inspectionof the Nauvoo Legion. Lieut. Gen. Wells and his staff received thetroops, after which a hollow square was formed and the Lieut. Gen. delivered an animating address to the troops, which was well sustainedby the officers of his staff and chaplain.We have had much excellent preaching lately by the FirstPresidency and others. Prest. Young has come out boldly and told thispeople in the name of the Lord, they must repent and be baptizedfor the remission of their sins. Several Wards have gone forwarden masse been baptized and recieved their covenants before the Lord,and I believe the fire of a universal reformation in this Territoryhas been lit and will continue to burn, until a permanentfoundation for good works has been laid in our midst. We must say since the organization of this church our ears have never beensaluted with more pointed Godlike sermons, than have flowed latelyfrom Prest. Young and his counsellors.We are happy to announce the arrival of Elders F. D.Richards, Daniel Spencer, Jos. A. Young W. H. Kimball Geo. D. Grant, James Ferguson, John Van Cott, C. H. Wheelock, N. H.

 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF.President Woodruff said: The taber-nacle of our dear beloved brother,pioneer, father and patriarch, LorenzoD. Young lies before us today. We have met together to pay our respectsto it, and to bury this our friend in the earth, to lay his body in the tomb torest until the time of the resurrection.But Brother Young's spirit is free.Whether he is here attending the funeral of his body or not I do not koow; that is something that is notrevealed to me. But I will say thatwith the knowledge I have of the Gospel of Christ I have never beenable, since I have been acquaintedwith the principles of the Gospel, tomourn in my heart and my spirit overany faithful Latter-day Saint who haddied and departed this life. This mayseem strange, and sometimes I have thought that perhaps I have offended some of my friendsin expressing myself with regard tothese things. Until I heard theGospel, death was a most gloomy thingto me. In my early youth I attended funerals. I looked upon the deadbody; I saw it placed in the tomb,covered up in the earth, and it was a very gloomy matter to me. I did notknow where the spirit of that body wasgoing to. I did not know what itsdestiny was. But when I became ac-quainted with the Gospel of Christthese things were all clear to my mind;and from that day to this I have neverbeen able to mourn over anybody,prophets or apostles, fathers, mothers,brothers, sisters, or any of the Saints ofGod who have dwelt in the flesh andkept the celestial law of God andqualified themselves to enter into the

 celestial kingdom of our God. Thereis something about it that takes awaythis feeling of mourning and deathfrom me.I have been associated with BrotherYoung for sixty years of my life. Hecame with us here in our pioneer journey. He has been with us fromthat day till this. He has livd andlabored with us, and as far as I knowfulfilled every duty that has been re-quired at his hands. I believe he is the last of the family. One reasonwhy I cannot mourn over BrotherYoungâand it will apply to all thefaithful Saintsâis this: when a manhas dwelt in the flesh, has obeyed theGospel of Christ, has recieved theordinances of the house of God per-taining to the Holy Priesthood, andperpared himself so that when thespirit leaves his body he can enterinto the presence of God or into thepresence of the righteous, and pre-pared also to have a place in the first resurrectionâwhen a man of this kindpasses away I cannot mournover him. And that I view as the condition of Brother LorenzoYoung today. I believe that he is mingling with his father'shouse, with his brothers, and perhapswith the Prophet Joseph; and if theveil was take from our faces and we could see and comprehend the position of Brother Young today, none of uscould mourn.I visited Brother Young severaltimes before his death. The last timebut one I visited him I felt impressedto lay my hands upon his head and bless him, and I did. I blessed him asfar as I had power to bless anybody in the earth. He has been a man I thought a great deal of, because of histruth, of his goodness, of his gener-osity and of the feeling and spirit ofGod that has been with him all hislife, as far as I have been acquaintedwtih him.I do not wish to detain the congragation; but there is one sentiment I wish to utter. If I had power to de-cide the destiny of the children of men,I would like to decree that everyson and daughter of the oldPatriarch, Father John Young,the father of Brother LorenzoYoung, and all the descendants ofFather John Young, Brigham Young,Jospeh Young, Phineus Young and Lorenzo YoungâI say I would like todecree if I had the power that the pos-terity of these men should follow in their channel, whereby when they get through they may have experience,light, knowledge and truth, every oneof them, sufficient to prepare them tomingle in the same society, the sameplace, the same glory, the same exalta-tion and blessings that these noble menenjoy who have passed away. I havebeen associated with the whole family.I have traveled forty years with Presi-dent Brigham Young, at home andabroad. I know something of his life. You know him. He is known to this people. He is known to the world.He was a great man, a good man, a righteous man. God raised him up to perform a great work, and he ac-complished it all until he finishedhis mission in the flesh, andthen he went home to God,who gave him, and mingled withthe Prophets and Aposltes. If the veil was taken off and we could com-prehend the blessings these men enjoy,the sting of death would pass from us. All is right with our brother. He has lived a good and righteous life. Hehas finished his work with joy and re-joicing, and he has passed away from the trouble and tribulations of this world. He will come forth in the morning of the first resurrection,clothed with glory, immortality and eternal life, and dwell with therighteous. We have to become ac-quainted with the celestial law, withthe terrestrial law, and with thetelestial law, and the glories of whichthe ancient patriarchs and prophetsspoke, and of which the Apostles Paulspoke at some length; and it will payany mortal being on the face of the earth to pursue a course whereby he may be made a partaker of thecelestial glory and obtain the blessingsof that glory. I think sometimesthat we ourselves come far short of comprehending our privileges and ourblessings that we enjoy here in life.I thank God I have lived to hear the Gospel. I thank God I have lived tosee prophets and apostles. I desiredthis in my youth with every sentimentof my heart. I have lived to see all Idesired in my heart with regard to those things. I have spent over sixty years of my life with prophets andapostles. I rejoice in this. As to my-self, I am liable any hour or any dayto occupy the same position Brother Young does now. I have felt in myheart that I did not want to live anhour longer than I could live to do some good in the earth. The Lordhas preserved my life to a good oldage. In fact, I have had to give theLord all the glory and honor and cre-dit for every blessing I have ever en-joyed. I have known for myselfthat what I have recieved has beenby the power of God, and not ofman. I know these principles thatBrother Joseph F. Smith has beenreading about are true. The resur-rection is true. We are placed hereand a mighty responsibility rests uponus as Latter-day Saints. The Lordhas placed upon us the Holy Priest-hood, and we are under this great re-sponsibility of magnifying this Priest-hood in our day and generation,preaching the Gospel, doing good, building up Zion, and preparing the way for the coming of the Son of Man. I feel to rejoice with the Saints of God;and I hope when I get through withmy work here I will be able to meetour brethren in spirit as well as inthe resurrection. These things arejoyful to me in my meditations. Thesebrethren that I have been with for a great many years; they die, and the spirit leaves the body. We bury them,and of course there is a separation. But I look forward, which we can all do, with faith and with confidence, to the time when we shall again minglewith them. I believe that whenBrother Young's spirit left him he metmany friends in the spirit who wereready to accompany him wher-ever he had to go. To whatever place he had to go he did not goalone, but had friends to go with him. His mission is finished here, and wehave to follow in our day and time. Therefore let us all try to be faithfuland to do our duty; try to walk up-rightly before the Lord, and labor to overcome the temptations of the devil. The enemy labors to draw away everySaint of God. We have to contend against these spirits of evil.I pray God my Heavenly Fatherthat His blessings may rest upon us.I pray that the hearts of the family may be comforted. With regard to our brother who is taken away, I donot feel that they can mourn in theirspirits over Brother Lorenzo. He lived as long as was necessary, as longas he could do good int he flesh; andwhen he passed away he finished thelabor of this probation. He was senthere for work; he finished th[a]t work. So have his brothers, as well as manyof the Elders of Israel, finished theirwork and mission. We ourselves stillremain, and we have got our work to finish. If we do it right, all will bewell with us. I pray God that His blessings may be with us, that wemay all be led by the Spirit and powerof God in the paths of righteousness, ofholiness and truth, and that we mayaccomplish the work assigned to us ina way and manner that we may be jus-tified when we have finished our work,which is my desire in the name ofJesus Christ. Amen.

 Apostle W. Woodruff said there never was a prophet or inspired man upon theearth in any age who did not requirethe spirit of God to teach him thethings of God, and that no quorum ofTwelve Apostles who had ever livedupon the earth had been more unitedor had done a greater work toward building up God's kingdom than theTwelve were now performing. He then gave an account of his recent mis-sion to the Saints and Lamanites inArizona. During a visit of nine months among the settlements of the Saints inthat territory the speaker had not heard a man profane the name of theDeity, had not seen any quarrelsamong neighbors, had not known ofany drinking of intoxicating liquor, noru[s]ing of tobacco, tea nor coffee; in facthe had not [witnessed] the vices whichare too common in the cities and townsof Utah. The town of St. John, Apachecounty that, having been owned byJews and Mexicans, and as the "Mor-mon" settlements were located aroundthis town, it was thought expedient tobuy the township, accordingly the pur-chase had been made.The tribes of Indians visited were the Navajoes, Apache, [Haqui], and Zuni.The two former tribes been verywary [3 or 4 illegible words (page break)] were called by theElder [[illegible (page break)The former were roving and savagetribes, the latter lived in town and were partly civilized. He was well treated in all the travels among them. The strictest attention was given to allthe preachings, and the teachings andinstructions he imparted caused a spiritof thankfulness and rejoicing amongthem. Especially was this the caseamong the Zuni who were the mostintelligent and civilized of all the tribes. through their earnest request, he con-tinued speaking unto them for severalhour[s], whenever he would stop thequestion would be asked "Do you knowany more?" and the hearer became soovercome that they wept for joy. The situation on the [H]aqui villages was very picturesque, they being built upon tables of solid rock from [500] to 1300 feetin height with perpendicular [sides].Here they had lived for centuries per-haps--Tilling their farms below and carrying the products their fuel and their water up to their homes by means of a circuitous [p]ath or dugwaythe frequent raids of the [Warkka reing]had driven them (the Haqui) to thismanner of living, that they might pro-tect their lives and property without going to war. Some of the leading menamong these tribes had said that beforethe white came among them [adultery]was not known [the term "adulterer"] such a sin was punishable by death. In conclu-sion, the speaker alluded to the re-markable preservation of the Saints ingathering from the nations of the earth,testified to the near approach of the Son of Man, and exhorted the Saints tofaithfulness continually.

 Pres. Wilford Woodruff, addressed the Saints and remarkedthat if he had all the elders Isreal before him this afternoonhe would like to speak to them a short time and it wouldbe that when they get up to speak to cease making excuses, he was displeased to hear such things, he like to hear aman get up and speak to say what he has to say to sayit without making excuses when the elders stand up toteach should do so by the aid and insperation of the Holy Ghost, min^esters^ and Law^yers^ are trained to speak, Hespoke of the stamina that is required to receive and live up to the truth, because of the unpopularity of the gospel,the world hates the Saints as it did Jesus when he was onthe earth, The world deride the saints because they areoutspoken against wickedness and coruption, The Lordhad gathered up a people to serve him, and to assistin the building up of the Kingdom of God, The worldhas become infidel and becoming more so continually,The Christianity of the day in conection with its mini-esters have done more to cause infidelity than all the writings ofProfessed Infidels put togeather, he refered to the greatevils that exists in the world, The Lord will hold agreat account against the elders of this generation,because of the great intelligence God has revealed to us, The heavens are watching over us, and all good men beyondthe veils are solicutious for our welfare, and are anxiousthat we shal prevail against all the evils that arebrought to bear against us, He spoke of the permenancyof this work because it was of and from God, if it wasof man it could be easily prevailed against, let thesaints then do their duty, and make our probationeffectual, we lived before we came here in the presence of HeavenlyFather & Mother, It would not now pay to apostatise fromthe Truth, urged the completion of the Temple that wemay redeem the living and the dead, for God requiresthis at our hands, The world wonder and gaze at the eldersand this people they wonder more if God has a hand init than he has not, he bore a faithful testimonyto the truth of this world, and assisted the triumphof this people, and Kingdom, and referred to themany who have come to an Ignominious end whohave fought against this people, he exorted the saintsto be faithful to the end, and be saved in the Kingdomof God, and implored the blessings of God upon the saints, 
 Pres. Wilford Woodruff, expressed himself appearinglyof the remarks of the former speaker, he spoke of the great change, & improvement which have beenwrought in a quarter of a century in these vallies ofthese mountains, he spoke of the great future thatis before the saints Judging from the past what maywe expect to take place in the next 1/3 of a century,to come he spoke of the unbelief of thingsem as also theinfidelity that is to be found in the world, he refered tothe remarks of Bro. Smith in regard to the propertraining of our children, and thought such remarkswere necessary for the benifit of the young and rising generation, he spoke of the responsibility resting upon thesaints, and ^a^gain adverted ^to^ the great blessings that is every where manifest through out all Utah,he spoke of the interposition of the almighty inpreserving the saints and their crops, from theinsect that is here in this country, was glad tonote the increase of the faith and good works amongthe saints & especially the young & urged the saints to educate & train their children and prepare themfor the work that lie before them. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFwas pleased to have the opportunityof listening to the many good re-marks uttered by the speakers. In referring to the reports made by the Bishops respecting the secur-ing of missionary farms, nearly allreported a diflicully to obtain the same. He suggested the proprietyof selecting farms above irrigationlimits and sow rye thereon, and thus secure a product that would be nearlyor quite as valuable as wheat andthus form a source of support for thefamilies of missionaries in the field.He alluded to the antagonism thatis found in the world against the [lamb], and remarked that this oppo-sition existed before Adam was cre-ated and dwelt here in the flesh. Re-ferring to the career and treatmentof our Savior, who in the midst of a cruel and excruciating death, im-plored the Father to forgive his mur-derers, for they knew not what theydid. He enjoined upon the Saints,while their enemies were seeking theirdestruction, to emulate the Savior in his dying agonies to ask the Lord toforgive them for what they do andare seeking to do against us, and feelwilling to leave them in the hands ofthe Almighty. He spoke of the ne-cessity of all becoming acquaintedwith these things, and exhorted theyoung men to study the gospel andits duties, and touched upon the in-tricate and perplexing circumstancesthat exist among the nations, thatculminate in their destruction.He was not surprised at the utter-ances of the priests of the day,against the Saints, seeking and urg-ing violent means for their extirpa-tion. The evil on is their prompter and abettor, and we could not expectanything different from them; nev-ertheless this kingdom will prevailand overcome all opposing powers.This is its ultimate destiny. He ex-horted the Saints to keep all the lawsand commandments of the Lord and thus entitle themselves to His pro-tection and blessing. He encour-aged the Saints to take no heed of the efforts of the wicked, for oppo-sition must come, because the Lordhas called us out of the world and asit hated the Savior so it will theSaints.
