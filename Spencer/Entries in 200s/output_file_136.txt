I closed by making An address concerning  Zion in the following words   rest of page blank ENDENTRY  without turning my eye towards  now merely a phantom of the brain or a name, but actually a  living thing. Truly  A Tabernacle, the Mountains of Israel. Her bed is in the cham- bers of the rocks. Her garden one of the rich valleys of Ephraim  She speaks and Her voice is as the voice of God. She has A spirit  which burns like flames of fire. She has power, And has started  A little stone rolling from the mountain her habitation, which  increases as it goes: it is causing the Earth to quake &amp; tremble,  take care ye Nations it will grind you to dust. She has messengers who go &amp; come at her bidding, one of them can chase A thousand  and two put ten thousand to flight, they command the Element &amp; they obey them. She has An Ensign for the Nations to flee to. She has A law which will soon govern the Earth. She is  born in the generation that David had A view of. O Praise  the LORD I am a witness that mine eyes have beheld her.  She has Keys to open &amp; no man can shut, And shut And no man  can open. Her power is from Heaven whare she hath Noble  senators who plead her cause both day &amp; night. This is the Zion I seek After, this is the Zion I speak off. Her Church is the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Her city  was sought in 1847 And the Lord has favored her from that  that time. And During the year 1848 the Church has been organized with A first Presidency of three persons viz Brigham  Young, Willard Richards, who have gatherd  to the mountains of Israel, in the valley of the Great Salt  lake, Great Basin North America, And taken with them  some three thousand souls with their flocks &amp; Herds, which  makes A population of about seven thousand souls in the  city of the Great Salt Lake. The Lord has also blest their  land which has brought forth in abundance. And while the Lord  has been multiplying blessing upon Zion in her quiete Habitation Her messengers have been crying aloud to the Nations of  the Earth &amp; the Isles of the sea preaching the gospel unto them And uttering their testimony in the power of God And the  gift of the Holy Ghost untill they have gatherd their thousands  together untill one of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb (Orson  Pratt) Estimates that it will take three hundred ships to remove the saints from the British Isles Alone to Zion. The Saints who  were gather into the valley of the Sacramento have discoverd  such vast mines of gold silver copper &amp; other precious ores that the report of it is creating great excitement throughout the world  Esspecially in the United States untill tens of thousands are rushing to the gold regions to try to obtain the precious mettal. And as the hand of God has been so visible in all the signs of 1848 May He continue his work  through 1849 and all following years untill His arm shall be made bare  in the eyes of all Nations. Untill Zion shall arive to her full strength of Manhood  for Brass may she have gold for Iron silver for wood Brass for stones Iron.  May her execters &amp; peace officers be righteous men. May her Nobles be of Ephraim And her Govournor procede out of the midst of Him. May all of her Messengers be armed with righteousness in the power of God in great glory. May all of the Nations of the Earth fear &amp; tremble because of her law. May the wicked find her sons terrible when they go to battle against her &amp; not have power to stand before them. May her dwelling places  be distinguished by a pillar of fire by night &amp; cloud by day, &amp; in fine may she arise  &amp; shine forth And spread herself abroad with all that perfection of beauty power  &amp; glory which has ever been spoken concerning her Even to the full Expectation of God Angels &amp; man  Wilford Woodruff   ENDENTRY February 16, 1849       ENDENTRY February 17, 1849    It was full of news on Calafornia, gold digings, &amp;c large Extracts from the Calafornia Star.

Also made An extract from my address to the Historian concerning Zion &amp;c &amp;c. The following is an Extract of my letter to him FIGURES    Elder Pratt, Beloved Brother, As this is my birth day Also the  first day of Spring, my mind is led this morning more than usual to reflect upon the signs of the times of the Globe upon which we dwell And while meditating upon Zion And Her messengers my mind flits across the Ocean &amp; runs over the wall And takes A view of A large co- mpany of swift messengers who are the Horns of Joseph used to push the people together from the ends of the Earth, these meditations create A desire to convers A few moments with Br Pratt. So while all Nature is locked fast in sleep before the dawn of day is broke to start man from his slumber I seat myself to say A few words to you. I said this was my birth day, yes I am  a man while counting up his years in this probation. The vary sight of them croud into the mind A flood of thought even more than tongue can utter or pen can write. The last sixteen years of my life has been spent in endeavouring to preach the Gospel &amp; build  up the Kingdom of God in connexion with my brethren. The past is gone, I have no desire to recal it, I  my life over if I could. I feel like looking forward &amp; not backward I have a great desire that I may spend my future days doing the works of righteousness, Honoring the Priesthood &amp; my calling, saving the souls of men, &amp; building up the Kingdom of God that I may have a  place with the faithful at the end of the race. Turn my eyes which way I will Either towards Babylon or Zion And I find the mov- ements &amp; signs of Either of them at the present day Are fully keep- ing pace with the wheels of time. It is deeply interesting to see hear, feel, &amp; live in this age and gaze upon the scenery of the  whole Earth rushing like A Mighty cataract to finish its work while the high minded Jew in the highth of his pride was exha- usting his talents &amp; oratory to prove to the Roman and the world  their right to independance greatness &amp; power. The Son of God was in Lamb like meekness bowing to the ordinance of Baptism And all the rites of the gospel &amp; commandments of his Father looking forward to the day when He should make his second visit to his brethren with his reward upon his head. So at the present day while the Emperors, Kings, Princes, Lords, Nobles, Presidents Governours, Statesman with all the great men of Babylon have been making A desperate Effort to maintain their dignity And appear to a good Advantage before the whole Earth   ENDENTRY  like Jesus and the Apostles have been meekly submitting to  the ordimances of the gospel, and like little children have  been subject to the Authority of the Holy Priesthood And have  made evry sacrafize required and laboured day &amp; night to build up Zion that the honest in Heart &amp; the meek of the Earth may have A place to flee to in order to Escape the just judgment of ^that^ God whose rod is now suspende to Fall upon the Earth and lay great Babylon with all of Her  greatness, pomp, power, and glory in the dust. My Prayer to God  is that evry Elder of Israel &amp; saint of God throughout the whole  Earth may be incouraged to labour dilligently &amp; faithfully  while the day of Harvests lasts for soon night will come when  No man can work, the As was their chief captain &amp;     ENDENTRY March 3, 1849    Also recieved A letter from Whipple called upon  me And spent the Afternoon I had A good time with him we conversed upon A variety of subjects Among other things He informed me that  the Utah Lake abounded with the largest kind of the Mountain trout some As much as two &amp; three feet in length And that all the small &amp; large streams puting out of the Mountains Also  Abounded with trout.

ENDENTRY March 4, 1849    President Polk went out last night President Taylor is installed to morrow.

Elder J P Haven from the Bluffs Also And A vary full House. I Addressed over one hour &amp; had much of the Spirit of God resting upon me And bore A strong  testimony unto the People preached the first principles of the gosple And spoke of the general Bareings of the work of God  in the present Dispensation. In speaking of the body of Christ And members in particular I told them I had seen men in  my travels without Arms, legs, some without eyes, &amp;c but I had  never seen A man going about without A head. And As A natu- ral body without A head would dye so the Church without ^a^ Head  would die.    remarks And ede the right of the kingdom belonged to them &amp; Jesus came &amp; set up the kingdom  among them they rejected it He took the kingdom from the Jews gave it  to the Gentile all that were in the kingdom went to the gentiles with the  Kingdom of God. The Gentiles in like manner have Apostitized And have not continued in the goodness of God still they have A rightt to have the  kingdom of God set up among them in the last days And Joseph Smith  being warned &amp; commanded of God has recieved the gospel from the hand  of an Angel, preached it to the gentiles set up the kingdom for the last time among them they have rejected it, it will now again be taken from them  &amp; given to the Jews &amp; all in the kingdom will go to the Jews with it &amp; many will  come from E. W. N. S. &amp; si   ENDENTRY  the principles of repentance, by A figure. If A Mother set two little  children at work, they should leave it &amp; go to play &amp; dirty their clothes And when the Mother came she find they had not done the work but been disobediant but promised forgiveness if they would  go wash their face change their closes clothes &amp; do the work one goes &amp;  do as she is required the other follows her Mother &amp; crys all day &amp;  pleads with her to forgive her. When night comes one has cryed all day for f has done the things required, which is most justifyed the  one that obeyed the Mother. So with Man it is not evry one who says Lord, Lord, that shall enter into my Kingdom but He that  doeth the will of my father who is in Heaven.
