 and stands upon a hill. The monument was about eighty feet highThe Duke was of course a member of the BritishParliament and as an emblem of his legislative character he held inhis ^left^ hand a roll of paper. He stands facing his splendid mansion whichis an expensive and majestic building in the vale north of the monumentat which a person has a fine view of it.The house covers 4 acres and is built of hewnstone having much carved work of lions and other images. There were365 windows in it before the repairs and additions which the presentDuke was making which it was supposed would take seven yearsto accomplish.There were some hundreds of acres of woodlandon the estate and farm patches all of which were enclosed witha fence of 4 or 5 feet high. The whole of the fence was composedof solid iron railing miles in length.In this park the Duke had vast quantiesof game fish and fowl. The deer was as tame as sheep. Wesaw about 300 of them in one drove.The river Trent runs through the Parkand the Duke has converted the whole of it for some distanceinto a fish pond.I visit the burrying ground which wascovered with many kinds of evergreen.The public road running through the Parkis between two stone walls about 10 feet thick and from fourto six feet high covered with turf and green grass.The Duke of Sutherland has two otherParks as valuable as the one we visited and his wealth wascomparatively inexhaustible and beyond his own knowledge.My Birthday, March 1st.On this day I was thirty three years of ageOn this birthday I preached in ^Hanly^ and broke bread andin the evening I preached again to a large congregation whenthe Spirit and power of God rested upon me. Four offeredthemselves for baptism and others received my testimonywhom I expected would be baptized. 
 to silence for the murmerers saw that he stood in the power of aProphet of the Lord God.The next month was principally spent in my attending schooland some interesting meetings and preparing myself for my endowmentswhich I was soon to have the privilege of receiving in the Temple of theLord with many others.On March 23rd I went up to the House of the Lord at anearly hour in the morning to spend the day in prayer and fastingwith the Saints in Kirtland as this was a day set apart for thatpurpose. Immediately after en^t^ering the House in company^with^ of several other Elders I went within the veil and we bowedbefore the Lord in the Aronic Stand and offerred up our morning sacrifice. The Spirit rested upon us with joy to our souls.I was then called upon by Father Joseph to reada chapter in the Book of Mormon and I read a chapter from theBook of ##Jacob 5|Jacob## which contains the parable of the tame olive treelikened unto the house of Israel as was spoken by the ProphetZenos. The same God that touched Isaiah's lips with hallowed^fire^ gave Zenos great wisdom in setting forth this parable.When I had made some brief remarks upon thesubject the congregation took their seats for the service of theday in the following order:The house being divided into four parts by veils thefemales occupied two parts and the males the others. Some of thePresidency presided in each appartmentThe time was taken up during the day in singingexhortation and prayer. Some had a tongue others an interpretation and all was done in order. The power of God rested upon thecongregation. Upon some the gifts were poured out while othershad the administration of angles and the image of God sat uponthe countenances of the Saints.At four o'clock in the afternoon the veils were all rolledup together which brought the whole congregation in full view ofeach other and while the presence of the Lord filled the house thecongregation of Saints fell upon their knees and all as with one accordvocally poured forth rejoicing supplication and prayer before the God ofIsrael. This closed the service of the day after contributing forthe support of the poor.Sunday March 26 in the latter part of the day ElderWarren Parrish preached the funeral sermon of sister Pratt the 
 He was a strong beleiver in the prophecies of Joanna Southcott andwas one of the society. We then returned and had a viewof St. Pauls cathedral, the largest in the world exceptSt Peter's at Rome. We crossed London Bridge tooktea at 19 King Street, and then went to Union chapel,Waterloo Road, and heard a comical sermon deliveredby an Atkinite preacher. I spent the night at 58 KingStreet at Mrs Loftus.The next day August the 21st was themost interesting sight seeing day in my life, as far as theviewing the splendid works of manI started in company of Elders HeberC Kimball and George A Smith for a walk over thecity of London. We crossed London Bridge, and passedthrough King William Street, and several other streets, and visited Covent Garden, then through St Martin Street and Court, LeicesterSquare, Sidney Alley, Coventry Street, Picadillie, Glass Hous stand through most of Regent Street, The latter is one of themost splendid streets in the world. We passed throughLangham Place, and All Souls Church, which has a spire nakedfrom its base to the top, then through Oxford Street, andreturned by way of St Paul's, and ended our sight seing ofthe day by visiting the noted monument erected in commemoration of the great fire in London, in 1666, and built underthe direction of that famous Architect, Sir Cristopher Wren.We entered a door at its base (paid 6 pence on entering) andascended 345 black marble steps which brought us up 200feet into the air and about 100 feet higher than the highesthouses. We steped on the outside of the pillar, which issurrounded by an iron railing; and here we had presentedto our view an indescribable scenery on every handof one of fthe greatest capital cities of the world, & which can boastof a history of nearly two thousand years. At our feet, as it were laid a historical panorama stretching out to ourview arround. Never before had I beheld such a splendidsight never before such a grouping of the monuments ofancient times never before beheld such a grand historicalillustration of London as it was through the long succession of 
 About this time commencedA Great Work in the Potteries & ^County of^ Herfordshire.^through my labours^which resulted in the baptism of hundreds and the workflourished and grew and the fame thereof went abroadthroughout that region of countryOn the 4th we took coach to Worchester andthere walked to Mr John Benbow's Hill Farm Castle FroomeLedbury Herefordshire.Mr Benbow was a large farmer andcultivated about 300 acres of land. I spoke the word ofGod to him and his house and he received my testimonyand we had a good time. I spent the night at hishouse, and also the next day and preached there andhad the testimony that there was^ere^ many present that wouldbecome Saints.On the next day I preached again athis house in the evening when a number received theword and I baptized six. Mr John Benbow andhis wife were among the numbers. The other four werepreachers of the United Brethren of the Methodist Order.I spent the next day in preparing a pondto baptize in.The next day was Sunday when I preached in the morning at Frooms Hill in the afternoonat Standly Hill and in the evening at the Hill Farm.The Lord was with me and I baptized 7 persons 4of whom were preachers of the United Brethren. I alsoconfirmed 13 and broke bread with the Saints.Next day I preached again at StandlyHill and baptised 7 persons more 2 of whom were preachers,and one ^on^ the one following ^day^ I baptized 12 persons more, 3 ofwhom were preachers.I preached on the next three daysand the power of God was with me. On the thirdday after preaching at Stokes Lane I baptized three othersinto the Church. 
 wife of Elder P. P. Pratt one of the Twelve Apostles. Sister Pratt diedMarch 25 1837.On Monday, the following day I signed fifty dollars forthe building of the House of the Lord in Zion. The subscription listwas in the hands of Elder Elisha H. Grovesof Several subsequent days I spent in perusing the outlinesof ancient and modern history by the Rev. Royal Robbins. Thereflective mind is struck with deep sensibility in viewing therise & progress, and decline and fall of the nations and Kingdomsof the earth since the days of Adam. And it is equally importantand interesting to contemplate the day that has already begunin fulfilment of ancient prophecy when Israel shall be restoredthe Kingdom of God established upon the earth and thecovenants made by the Lord unto Abraham Isaac and Jacobrealized by their seed. As I read this book and reflected uponthose things I sensibily felt my calling from the Lord ashis servant to act my part in the fulfilment of his workand now as one of the first Seventies of Israel to become aspecial witness of Jesus Christ to the nationsApril the 13rd brought the day for the preparationsto be made for the solemn assembly and the anointing andendowment of the Elders of Israel. Those were now to receivetheir endowments who had not received them in the Spring of1836 and as I was absent at that time it fell to my lot toreceive this blessing with those who were to pass through theTemple for endowment at this time.I shall record the events of each day of the endowmentfor the benefit of the generations to come.On this 3rd day of April I met in the house of theLord with a number of the Seventies to received counselcil respectingour washings and anointings. I was appointed with ElderG. Meeks to visit President F. G. Williams and have the perfumesand oil prepared for the day following that we the Elders of Israelmight become the anointed ones of the Lord according to therevelations of Jesus Christ and as sung by the poet:"We'll wash and be washed and with oil be anointed"Withal not omitting the washing of feet"For he that receiveth his penny appointed"Must surely be clean at the harvest of wheat." 
 England's greatness by this magnificient view of London asit is in the present dayWe were situated so as to overlook nearly everypart of the city. East of us lay the ancient Tower of London; theplace of so many great historical episodes of English history, thescene of many of the capital tragedies of England and the terribleBastile of England the frowning political sepulcure of thenation where the absolute monarchs and great ruling chiefsof the land have buried their victims their secrets and theircrimes.East of us also lay the Mint; North the MansionHouse of the Lord Mayor of London; North West St Paul's churchWest- Westminster Abbey and the House of Parliament; Southlies the River Thames with five of the large bridges acrossin full view and one not seen from the mMonument makingsix: One of the collossal arched Bridges of the Thames isof solid cast iron called Southwark Bridge. This also is thecelebrated "Suspension Bridge" which at this time was oneof the great wonders of the age. The other collossal andmagnificent bridges of the royal Thames (England's chief river)are London Bridge Blackfriars Waterloo Westminster andVauschall all of which are built of massive stone. Thesesix bridges are fine sights in themselves. They are thearchitectural monuments of the Thames; and our view of themfrom our high pinnacle with their crowds of moving andeverchanging human masses, and to so describe it mobs ofcabs, omnibuses, carriages, drays, &c., which dash along and seenas though they were going to lock together and dash eachother to pieces presented to us a picturesque sight. worthyof note.In addition to all this within our viewwas London Borough, on the South of the River, and allaround us hundreds of churches, chaples and spires, standing in the midst of one universal mass of buildings, covering about six square miles of groundWhile viewing this prospect on a clearday, we conversed with a Prussian Traveller, a citizen of Berlin,who had travelled much over Europe and Asia and other parts 
 Sunday the 15th of March I preached at Froom'sHill and met with the Saints in the afternoon and confirmedtwenty two persons and ordained John Cheese to the office of Priest.In the evening I preached to a congregation ofabout eight hundred but some of the baser sort made muchdisturbance. There was a number of persons that wished tobe pbaptized but they had to return home without it inconsequence of the people.On the next day I walked to Mainstonand obtained a license for preaching in any place under theEnglish Government.On my return I visited a number of personsand found them beleiving. I preached at Froom's Hill andbaptized three personsThe day following I had an agreeableinterview with Mr Thomas Kington the Superintendent ofthe United Brethren. I laid the fulness of the Gospel beforehim and he received the testimony.On the 20th I baptized three persons oneof whom was a preacher. While preaching on this day some ofthe lower sort armed themselves with rotten eggs and threwthem at me. One hit me in the head but did not breakuntil it struck the groundThe next day I walked to Ledbury andfound a letter from Brother Richards. Afterwards returningto brother Benbow's I baptized four persons 2 of whom werepreachers: one was Thomas Kingston the Superintendant ofthe preachers of the United Brethren. I felt to exclaimGlory to God, this work rolls on!Sunday I preached at Hill Farm andin the evening confirmed 6 persons and ordained Thomas Kingtonto the office of an Elder and William Jinkins to the office ofPriest.The next day I received letters fromJohn Taylor Willard Richards and Alfred Cordon. Elder Taylorinformed me that he had baptized seventeen persons inLiverpool and Elder Richards' wished me to enquire ofthe Lord his will concerning ^brother^ and sister Richards for 
 After fulfiling the above appointment Elder Meeks Priest Turpin andmyself repared to a room to attend to our first washing. After clensingour bodies from head to foot with soap and water we then washed ourselvesin clean water and afterwards with perfumed spirits. The evening wasspent with several Elders in prayer before God and his power restedcopiously upon us.The next day I met at the house of Elder Hales at one o'clockin the afternoon in company of twenty-three Elders for the purpose ofattending to the ordinance of washing. President Joseph Young who was ofthe number opened the meeting by prayer and we then proceeded withthe ordinance. Myself and Elder G. W. Meeks were the first washedunder the hands of President Joseph Young and we then assisted himin washing our brethren the Elders. Much of the Holy Spirit restedupon us.At early candle light we again met together in thequorum of Seventies at the upper part of the Lord's house to receiveour anointing. The quorums of the Priests Teachers and Deaconsoccupied one appartment the Elders another and the Seventies a thirdEach quorum met for their anointingThree of the Presidents met with the Seventies namely Joseph Young H. Aldrich and Z. Colultrin. After the meetingwas opened by prayer those who were to be anointed were suitablyaddressed and then the Presidency proceeded to the ordinance byfirst consecrating the oil. The person then presented for theanointing took a seat and the Presidency laid their hands uponhis head and pronounced such blessings upon him as the testimony of Jesus directed. We had truly a glorious season in this solemnordinance of the house of God. There were fifteen anointed inour quorum. President Coultrin anointed me and pronouncedupon my head great blessings which were sealed upon my head inthe name of Jesus Christ by a loud Amen from all presentThe meeting closed about 10 o'clock p.m. when I wentinto the lower court of the House of the Lord with Elders Joseph B.Nobles and G. W. Meeks to spend the night in prayer and fastingbefore God. Part of the night we had a severe trial of our faithby temptation from Satan but before day we obtained a good degreeof victory over him and the Lord poured out his spirit upon usand we felt it good to be in the House of our God when naturewas hushed in silence and the shades of night covered the earthIn the morning we returned to our homes intending to spend the 
 of the world, and he declaired that we could not find another spoton the face of the earth that would present to our view so granda scenery as the one before usThis mMonument on which we stood is 24feet higher than Trajans Pillar at Rome and on it is the following inscription in Latin:In the year 1666 the second day of Septemberfrom hence at the distance of 202 feet, the hight up this columnabout midnight a most terrible fire broke out which drivenon by a high wind not only wasted the adjacent parts butalso places very remote with incredible noise and fury.It consumed 89 churches the gates of the city, Guild Hallmany public structures hospitals schools libraries and a vastnumber of stately edifices 13,200 dwelling houses 400 streetsof 26 Wards it utterly destroyed 15 and left 8 others shatteredand half burnt. The ruins of the city were 436 acres:from the Tower by the Thames side to the Temple churchand from the North East Gate along the city wall to HolbornBridge. To the estates and fortunes of the citizens it was merciless but to their lives very favourable (only eightbeing lost) That it might in all things resemble thelast conflagration of the world the destruction was suddenfor in a small space of time the same city was set [a]most flourishing and reduced to nothing. The days after, When the fatal fire had baffled all human councils andendeavours, the opinion of all, as it were by the will ofheaven it stoped and on every side was extinguished.August 22nd I received a letter fromMrs Woodruff which gave me much joy and I wrote herin return. We also received one from Brigham Youngand a copy of the 4th No of the Millennial Star. I walkedout in the evening near the house of Parliament and boughta good pocket watch and paid  2.90Next day we went to Zion's chapel andheard the celebrated Rev Robert Aitken preach two sermonsHe delivered an interesting warning to the Gentiles, and presentedsome of the most sublime truths I ever heard from a sectarianpriest; but he was building without the foundation. 
 they were in deep affliction.On this day I preached at Standly Hill andbaptized twelve persons.A preacher called upon me On the onefollowing a preacher called upon me and after conversing withhim awhile he requested me to baptize him.I changed my clothing and as I gotready to go to the water three other preachers rode up ina carriage to see me.The fame had gone out into all the country around of the rapid work that God was doing amongstthe people. They had not heard me nor any Latter-day Saintpreach but had come more than 20 miles to see me.They came down out of the gig and walkedto where I was. Notwithstanding they were ministers I stood upand boldy testified of the work of God in these last days.The power of the Spirit rested upon me and they boweddown and prayed and gave glory unto God.We arose from our knees and the carriagestood still and we all went down into the water that samehour and I baptized them and afterwards laid my handsupon them that they might receive the Holy Ghost and theythen went on their way rejoicingAfterwards I went to ^Moorends Cross^ whereI preached and baptized five persons making nine during theday. I also wrote a letter and confirmed eight person.The next day I travelled and preachedas usual and at night I had a remarkable dream by which I feltcertain that there would be a great gathering of fish in the Gospeland that I should baptize many and some noted persons. I wasalso persuaded that more of our brethren was on their way fromAmerica.On the day following I baptized two moreone of whom was a preacher. I then walked to Shuknell Hill anoted and sightly place. The plains looked beautiful and thevalleys around the place ^town^ made the scenery picteresque inappearence. Notwithstanding that this was but a countryplace I counted twenty one churches from the top of the hill 
 day in fasting and prayer. Part of the day was occupied in attendingthe high council; the remainder until 5 oclock in writing prayer and fastingAt 5 o'clock I met in the House of the Lord with the Seventies fora solemn assembly anointing &c. Three out of the seven Presidentswere present and they anointed twelve. The Spirit of the Lordrested upon us and we were satisified and returned home.April the 6th was the great day of the Solemn AssemblyAs upon this day the Church was organized in 1830 the six of Aprilhas become a day specially set apart and as this an[niversary]of the organization of the Church was like the Pentecost atJerusalem [##Acts 2##] I shall somewhat fully record the proceedings of this timeAt 8 o'clock a.m. I went up to the House of theLord and spent an hour in the lower part. The Presidentsof the Church then called the quorums of the Seventies in theupper part of the house as there was some business to be attendedto before they could proceed with the order of the dayIn the first place six of the Presidents of theSeventies were taken from that position and transferredto the quorum of the travelling High Priests and six otherPresidents were chosen in their stead. I shall not give theparticulars of this change: suffice it to say that all of thecounsellors first chosen excepting Joseph Young were High Priestsbefore the organization of the Seventies and they had the rightto officiate in the lower offices of the ChurchThe six new Presidents chosen out of the Seventies totake the places of those who were to be transferred were [blank]After this matter was arranged there was a gloriousordinance performed upon the heads of those of the Elders whohad been anointed. While all the anointed present standinglifted their hands towards heaven the First Presidency ofthe Church confirmed and sealed upon our heads all the blessingsof our ordination anointing and Patriarchal with a seal in thepresence of God and the Lamb and his holy angels. This seal wasconfirmed with a shout from all the anointed with uplifted hands ofHosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna to God and the Lamb!Amen, Amen, and Amen!This was repeated three times and if ever a shout enteredthe portals of heaven this did and was echoed by the 
 On the 24th we removed our lodgings to Mr RobertMerryfields, No 15 Glousester Row, Grange Road, wehere we obtainedroom for all three of us.We visited St. Paul's Cathedral and went allthrough the lower court. Excepting St Peter's at Rome this is thelargest and most famed in the world.St Paul's is 500 feet long 20085 feet widefrom North to South 404 high from East to West andit contains 74 monuments of fine marble erected over thetoombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals and Earls and menof other titles who have distinguished themselves in the militaryservice of Great Britian and otherwise. Lord Nelson's Monument is the largest and most noted of the whole ofthe men thus honoured. Their bodies are placed in the vaults and their monuments erected on the flour aboveThis cathedral has three lofty spires and thewhole building is magnificient.St. Paul's church was first built by St Augustinein the year 610 and was destroyed by fire in 961 andrebuilt the following year. It was not until the reign ofAthelstan that London became the Metropolis of Englandand it was to this King that St Paul's was mostly indebtedfor its permanent establishment and pre-eminance. In 1086it was again destroyed by fire which also laid the greater partof the Metropolis in ruins. Maurice Bishop of London whohad been chaplain and Chancellor to William the Conqurer conceivedthe vast design of erecting the magnificient structure whichimmediately preceeded the present cathedral. In 1099 it wassufficiently built to admit of public worship but was again partlyburned in 1132 and again in 1135-6 and sustained considerableinjury. The central tower was completed in 1221 and additionswas made to the building from time to time. The lofty spireof the cathedral was fired by lightning in 1444 and not repairedtill 1462 and in 1561 it again caught on fire and the roofalso destroyed. Queen Elizabeth commenced to repair it andCharles the First completed it at the cost of 104330=4=8; butunder the rule of the Parliament and Cromwell the cathedralsuffered befyond any former example. Its revenues were 
 I preached in the evening to a large congregationand although it was the first time that they had heard the fulness ofthe Gospel yet if there had been water convenient there would havebeen twenty baptized but as it was a great distance to the water mostof them concluded to wait until another time.  Some however wouldnot take no for an answer and they followed me until 2 o'clockin the morning in search for waterWe finally found a stream and baptized fivepersons in a place where we had to let them down eight feet by abank before we reached the water. Three of these were preachers andone an old woman who had followed us the whole of the time leaningupon her staves.During the day ^and night^ I had baptized seven personsand on the next day I baptized two more one of whom was a Primitive^Methodist Preacher^The day following was one of much labour. Itwas Sunday the 29th. I preached at Frooms Hill at half past teno'clock at the Hill Farm at half past 2 and baptized thirteen intothe Church. In the evening I met with the Saints and confirmedthirty-five and broke bread with about eighty of the members ofthe ChurchI felt how much strength and wisdom I neededfor I was informed this day that some of the ministers of the Churchof England were holding councisels to petition Parliament to stop mypreaching and cause our religion to cease out of the land.The last ^30^ of March was the following daywhen I baptized and confirmed into the Church nine more soulsI walked to Ledbury and had not been in town an hour beforemany flocked around to see me and gave me the hand of fellowshipThe Baptist minister opened his chapel for meto preach in and he went into the pulpit with me and opened themeeting by reading the 35 ch. of Isaiah and prayed mightily for meI then arose and preached (it was said) to thelargest congregation that ever met in the chapel. The minister wasbeleiving a^nd^ bid me God speed. After meeting many offered themselvesfor baptismOn the morrow I baptized 13 more four ofwhom were preachers and afterwards I held a meeting in anotherplace at the house of brother Kington. 
 angels on high and brought down the power which rested mightily upon usAfter being in the upper room about two hours we again joinedthe congregation of the Saints in the lower lcourt and the house came to orderfor the business of the day. The veils were closed and each appartment commencedthe service of the endowment.The washing of the feet of the anointed was the first businessthat was attended to in which the Twelve assisted the Presidency.Heber C. Kimble attended to the washing of my feet and prophesied uponmy head pronouncing me clean from the blood of this generation likeas it was with the disciples when Jesus washed their feet.When the ordinance of the washing of feet was ended theveils were roled which brought the congregation into one assembly butthe stands of the Priesthood was still covered with veils and the Presidencywas in the lower stand.The Prophet Joseph then arose and addressed thecongregation for the space of three hours, clothed with the power spiritand image of God. He presented many things of vast importanceto the Elders of Israel. O that the record could be written as withan iron pen of the Eight principles and virtue that came forthout of the mouth and heart of the Prophet Joseph whose miss[ion]soullike Enoch's seems wide as eternity. That day showed strikinglythat he is in very deed and a Prophet of God raised up for thedeliverence of IsraelHe desired us to give heed to his words andteachings and be wise that Zion and her stakes might beredeemed. He also presented us in some degree with the plotof the city of Kirtland which is the strong hold of the daughter ofZion. The plan which he presented was given to him byvision and the future will prove that the visions of Joseph concerningJackson County all the various Stakes of Zion and of the redemptionof Israel will be fulfilled in the time appointed of the Lord.Presidents Hyrum Smith Oliver Cowdery and Sidney Rigdon followed with suitable addresses to the congregation.The Twelve were then called upon to break breadfor the multitude as Jesus did in the days of this Apostles when themultitude followed him. [##Matthew 14:19-20##] This was done and the congregation wassatisfied and we were made glad while feasting with Patriarchs ProphetsApostles Evangelists Pastors and Teachers. [##Ephesians 4:11##]The feast ended thanks were returned to God with up-lifted hands to heaven. And this being at about the setting of the 
 confiscated and seized by Parliament and the body of the buildingconverted into stables and barracks. In the reign of Charles the Secondit was again repared but was not finished when it became a preyto the great fire of London in 1666. The new cathedral the StPaul's of to day was built by Sir Christopher Wren. The firststone was laid on the 21st of June 1675 and the cap stone laidby the son of the Architect in 1710 and it was finished andissued by George the First in 1750 ^1715^. Its cost was over one millionand half sterling English money or nearly six million dollarsIts length from East to West is 500 ^ft^ and the breadth of thebody of the church 285 ft. and to the top of the cross over the domeits height is 404 ft: and it covers over two acres of ground.I again visited this cathedral on the 7th ofSeptember and went from the lower floor to the ball and visited every part of the building for public inspection. I walkedthrough the Whispering Gallery where a person can hear awhisper from any part of it and when the door shutsit penetrates the ear like peels of thunder.On the 25 of August we attended a meetingof the Temperance Society, at their Hall which we engaged,but could not have it until the 7th of the next month. Br Smithmade a short speech. On the following day, we started out to try toget some doors opened for preaching. Brother Kimballwent to one part of the city and brother Smith and myselfto another. We called upon two Baptist Ministers andasked one for his chapel. In the evening we attended a Methodist meeting in Song LaneNext day we again went to the TemperanceHall, in St George's Road, near the Elephant & Castle, and by therequest of the meeting  ^comittee^ I addressed the meeting upon the subjectof temperance, followed by George A Smith. We gave outan appointment to preach the Gospel at that place Sep the 7thThe day after we all started out to gothrough the city of London to see if we could find aman with the Spirit of God; and after wandering throughthe city, not Knowing whither we went, we came upon aman and stoped him and spoke to him. BrotherKimball asked him if he was a preacher? He said 
 On the 2nd of April I baptised 3 in ^Apperly^and 6 in Leigh and then walked to Twigworth and preachedand afterwards returned to Leigh.Two days afterwards I baptised eleven womenat Gadfields Elm and on the next which was Sunday I metfor prayer-meeting at Leigh.After meeting we went to a brother's forthe purpose of again administering the ordinance of baptismTen prepared for the ordinance but before we closed singingand prayer a desperate mob gathered together of about a hundredand the owner of the pond would not let us baptise whilesuch a mob was present fearing serious consequencesI then went in search of water in otherplaces for about of an hour with the mob following me, andrailing against me; but I could not find water and we had todefered it until the aftermoon. The mob commenced fitingghtingamong themselves and the people sent for constables to clearthe ground.After this I went to Norton andpreached and then returned to Leigh and the man gave hisconsent for me to baptize in his pondWe went immediately to the water andas I commenced to baptise the mob began to gather but Isucceeded in the administering the ordiance to nine personswhile surrounded by the rabble. I did not however receiveany injury nor did any of those baptised receive anymolestation except with the tongue. In the evening I preachedto a large congregation and the power of God rested upon usThe next day I baptized 5 more oneof whom was a preacher and another was a clerk in the Churchof England and two days afterwards I baptized seven more ^others^ andpreached to a large congregationThe day after I received two lettersone from Elder Willard Richards and the other from Elder JohnTaylor in which I was informed of the arrival of five ofthe Twelve and one of the Seventies. I was also advised thatthey had appointed a Conference at Preston on Wednesday the 15thof April and wished me to attend. 
 Sun all had the privilege of returning to their homes who felt sodisposed. The rest were to spend the night in the House of theLord in prayer exhortation praise and thanksgiving.At about candle-light the meeting commencedwith great interest. Joseph requested the congregation to speak theirfeelings freely and pray according to the Spirit.The Saints then began to open their mouths and theywere filled with language unto edification. One had a prayer anotheran exhortation another a doctrine some a psalm others a tongueand some an interpretation. Prophecy was also poured out uponus and all things were done decently and in order. Thus wasthe night spent glorously by the Saints; and the meeting havingcontinued until break of day we all dispersed to our homes with greatjoy and consolationThe next day I spent in writing my Journaluntil evening when I went up to the House of the Lord inwithElders Milton Holmes and Joseph B. Nobles. We were afterwardsjoined by an aged father in Israel by name Freeman Nickersonwho was very faithful and a man of much prayer. Beforehe joined us the power of Satan strove much against us; butour faith and peseverance in the Lord overcame him and wewere as baptized with the Holy GhostWhen we first entered the House of the Lordwe entered one of the Stands within the veils and fell upon ourknees but the Evil One strove against us with so much powerand temptation that at one time I was driven from mystand. But notwithstanding his apparant victory good grewout of it for by going into the courtyard I found father Nickersonwhom I solicited to join us that we might gain a victory overSatan. He joyfully accepted the invitation and we were nowfour in number and of one accord. Moreover we had greatcause to be united in heart for we had travelled together aboutone thousand miles in the Spring of 1834 for the redemption ofZion. At that time we offered to lay down our lifes and our offerings were accepted as was Abraham's [##Genesis 22##] and now we couldunitedly prevail and obtain a blessing through Jesus Christ.We fell upon our knees and cried mightily unto the Lord andthe Evil one departed and the Spirit of God within us was likefire shut up in our bones and many great things was shown untous by the Holy Ghost and minifested in prophecy and revelation 
 he was. He seemed to have a good spirit, and informed usthat he had been to America, and had come to London forthe purpose of going to South Australia, but had just burriedone child and another laid at the point of death. BrotherKimball told him his child should live. He gave us someinformation where we could preach. On the same day wecalled upon him and found his child better, but he wasnot at home. We then went and heard a Calvinest preachand he gave us an invitation to call and see himNext day we again went over the city to seeif we could any of the children of God. We found one manand his household who received our testimony, and he openedhis doors for us to preach. We appointed a meeting at his housefor Sunday evening. His name was Corner, and he lived at52 Ironmonger Row, St. Luke's Parish, near the church.Foundation of the Churchin The City of London.We had spent twelve days in going to and froLondon trying to find a people willing to receive our testimony,but finding the doors shut against us, we determined inthe name of God to into the streets and lift up our voicesAccordingly Elders Kimball, Smith, and myselfstarted out on Sunday morning, August the 30th; walkedthree miles and stoped in Tabernacle Square, Old Street, wherewe found an Aitkenite preaching to the people, who wasfollowed by a Presbyterian. Just as the latter was about tobegin, Elder Kimball informed him that there was a preacherfrom America present who would like to speak when hegot through. The preacher then informed the peopele thatthere was an American minister present, and proposed thathe should speeak first. Elder George A Smith then got intothe chair, and spoke about 20 minutes, and then the Presbyterianspoke. George A. had informed the people that there weretwo other American Preachers present who would like toaddress them; and, when the Presbyterian had closed, Elder 
 After preaching the niext night to a large congregationmany wished to be baptised but could not on account of the mob butsome wished to be baptised notwithstanding the persecutionAt about twelve o'clock at night I went to thepond to baptise. It was surrounded by a desperate mob and I baptisedfive persons in the midst of a shower of stones one of which hit me inthe head and ^which nearly^ knocked me down with the man whom I was baptised [baptizing]The next day I baptised 3 and I rode to Wolver-ampton and then took rail to Stafford. Here I found ten thousandpeople gathered to witness the hanging of two men. I came as nearto the jail as I could and in a few minutes they came upon thescaffold and almost immediately they were lanched into eternityThe gallows remained until 3' oclock whenit was removed I went into the jail and had an interview withElder Turley who had been falsely imprisoned upon a warrent fordebt which had been contracted fifteen years before he left Englandand which he supposed was settledI spent the night with brother Hulme andhaving spent the two next days in this district I took coach withElder Clark for Manchester and then being joined by Elder Claytonwe took the cars for Preston.On the 14th of April eighteen hundredand forty there was heldThe First Council of the Twelve Among the NationsThere was ^were^ present at this council Elders BrighamYoung Heber C Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt WilfordWoodruff John Taylor and George A. SmithElder Brigham Young was called to thechair to preside and John Taylor was chosen as Secretary.The Council was opened by prayer fromBrigham who was unanimously chosen as the Standing President ofthe Twelve and Elder Willard Richards was ordained to the Quorumof the Twelve by unanimous voice and according to a previousrevelation from the Prophet JosephAt the first sitting of the Council it wasresolved that he who may act as the Secretary of the Quorum shall 
 Sunday April the 9th I attended service in the House of the Lord. In the afternoon Elders Heber C. Kimble^all^ and Orson Pratt was followed by SidneyRigdon. He laid before them their situation as to temporal things saidthat the Gentiles were besieging the Saints and would gladly starve them todeath; that the Presidency had used every means for the deliverance of the Church; but that as many of the Church had refused Kirtland currency whichwas designed for our temporal salvation they had put strength into thehands of our enemies and thus the community must suffer by it.Joseph then arose and like the Lion of the Tribe of Judahpoured out his soul in the midst of the congregation of Saints. Whilelistening I thought "Who can find language to write his words and teachingsas with an iron pen in a rock that they might stand for future generationsto look upon." He seemed a fountain of knowledge from whose mouthstreams of eternal wisdom flowed; and ^as^ he stood before the peoplehe showed that the authority of God was upon him. When speakingof those who had professed to be his friends and the friends ofhumanity but who had turned traitors opposed the curancy andconsequently the prosperity of Kirtland he proclaimed that the Lordwould severely deal with. Joseph uttered the feelings of his soulin pain whie viewing the poverty and afflictions of the Saintsand in finding false brethren like whitened ^sepulcher^ whose course bringsperils upon the Church. [##Matthew 23:27##] Joseph is a father to Ephraim andto all Israel in these last days and he mourned because ofunbelief and the negligence manifested by many who have receivedthe Gospel and be feared lest but few be left of those in Kirtlandto recieve an inheritance. I wrote in my journal of this day,"There is not so great a man as Joseph standing in this generation.The Gentiles look upon him and he is like a bed of gold concealedfrom human view. They know not his principle his spirit,his wisdom his virtue his philanthropy nor his calling. Hismind like Enoch's expands as eternity and only God cancomprehend his soul.MY MARRIAGE.Marriage being an institution of Heaven and honorablewithal on the 13th day of April 1837, I joined hand with MissPhebe W. Carter in the bonds of holy matrimony. My firstacquaintence with my wife was on the eve of the 28th of 
 Kimball asked him if there would be any objection to our preachingthere at 3 o'clock. He answered "No;" not at all. Whatdenomination do you belong to?" "To the Church of JesusChrist of Latter Day Saints" was the reply"Oh I have heard of them" he said. They are"a bad people; they have done much hurt; they divide churches;"we don't want to hear you."He then mounted the chair again and said to the people,"I have just heard that the last man who spokebelongs to the Latter-Day Saints;" and then he began to railagainst us.Elder Kimball asked him to let him stopedepinto the chair to give out an appointment for a 3 o'clockmeeting, but he would not let him. Brother Kimball thenraised his voice and informed the people that some Americanpreachers would preach there at 3 o'clock. and at the appointedtime we were at the place.The conduct of the preacher andthe excitement upon the subject brought together a large congregation to hear us.I opened the meeting by singing andprayer and spoke about 20 minutes, from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal I. 8, 9 v## andwas followed by Elder Kimball for about the same length oftime. The people gave good attention and seemed to bemuch interested in what they heardAfter meeting Mr Corner invited us homebut soon after we arrived at his house, Elder Kimballfelt impressed to return to the place of preachingWhen he got there he found a large companytalking about the things which they had heard, and they wishedhim to speak to them again. He did so and addressedthem at considerable length, and afterwards several invitedhim home to their houses.While he was away a man who had beena preacher came to Mr Corner's and I gave him a briefaccount of the great work of God in the last days andthey received the things which I spake unto them.

After two andhalf months acquaintance we were united in matrimony.Johnathan Holmes was married at the same time to MissMary Carter. The ceremony was performed at the houseof the Prophet Joseph by President Frederick Williams. ThePatriarch Joseph then blessed us in the name of the Lordand pronounced great blessings upon us and our posterityThe Prophet himself was to have solemnized the ceremonybut his life was so sought and beset by wicked menthat he was under the necessity of fleeing from his houseand home for a few days.We were married at 2 o'clock in the afternoonand at 4 o'clock the whole company consisting of aboutsixteen couple walked from President Joseph Smith's toPresident Sidney Rigdon's where we witnessed the marriageof Elder George Robinson and Miss Thalia Rigdon whowas also married by President F.

 Mr Corner offered himself for baptism. This was thefirst man in the city of London who offered himselffor the ordinance of the Gospel. We appointed the nextevening to administer the ordinance of baptism unto himAfter supping with him we returned home by wayof London Bridge which was so crowded as also were thestreets that it was difficult for a person to get alongI was weary when I arrived homeand unwell during the night, but felt thankful unto theLord for the privilege of preaching to the inhabitants ofthis great city and to have gained one soul as a sealto our ministryOn the 31st being the next day werepeated the first fruits of our labours and as it were laidthe first living stone of the Church of Jesus Christ inEngland's great metropolisWe walked into the city and called uponMr Corner; but on our way we received a letter fromsister Eliza Bromley in which she stated that she haddreamed that we should soon baptize a man who woulddo much good.

 of the River Thames at Rotherhithe and after going about 800 feetdown into the earth we entered the archway on the left 1120 ft.of which was finished. It was beautifully lighted up with gas. Wewalked through the Tunnel with the River Thames and the shippingover our heads and in some places there is not more thanfifteen feet between the top of the arch and the bed of the riverThere are two archways running the whole length of the Tunnelwith openings affording free communications from one archwayto the other: At the time we visited the Tunnel it wasconsidered of the kind one of the most gigantic and wonderfulof human achievements. Visitors to this place of note in afteryears are familiar with a grand Bazar not there at the timewe visited it and Thames Tunnel purchases of Jewelry toys andfancy things are carried away by the visitors to all parts ofthe world as curiosities of association with one of the wonderfulplaces of London and momentoes of their purchasers visits to theGreat Tunnel under the monarch of England's rivers.About under In the centre of the River Thames we wrotein a record our names professions and residences and whenwe came out we went to the Tower of London in a boat, thedistance being about 2 miles. We did not spend muchtime here for it was getting late and we could nottherefore go through all the different appartmentsNext day I was quite ill. I had beenunwell for several days but now I was obliged to keep tomy room; but Elders Kimball and Smith went into thecity to visit the people and found some who hearkenedto them favourably. We had by this time found thatLondon was the hardest place for a mission which we hadever undertaken, but we did not feel discouraged in theleast; and were determined in the name of the Lord to setup the standard of the Kingdom in that cityThe following day I was still confined tomy room most of the dtime but on the next Elders Kimballand Smith went to Debtford, and I took a walk into thecity called upon Brother Corner and found him in good spirits.I also called upon Mr Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,Basin, who was a director of a Methodist chapel. I asked 
 Elder Willard Richards having been ordainedinto the Quorum of the Twelve Hyrum Clark was appointedCounsellor to Elder Fielding in the Presidency in the placeof brother Willard.Upon motion from Elder Fielding secondedby Brigham Young it was determined that a Hymn bookbe published and farther motioned that it be done underthe direction of the Twelve. A monthly periodical wasalso proposed.Several ordinations were attended toin the afternoon's Council.Heber C. Kimball laid before theconference the importance and propriety of ordaining aPatriarch to give Patriarchal blessings to the fatherless and tothe Saints according to the dictation of the SpiritAfter various remarks Bleazard Corbridgewas chosen by the Twelve to fill the Patriarchal office andPresident Fielding and his Counsellors proordained him.On motion by Brigham Young secondedby P. P. Pratt it was agreed that the next Conference should beheld on the 6th of July at Preston but it was subsequentlyarranged to be held at Manchester.The next ^day^ the 16th of April the Councilof the Twelve held its last sitting prior to the adjournmentBrigham Young proposed and John Taylor^seconded^ that Parley P. Pratt be chosen as the Editor of the monthly periodicalfor the Church. Elder Kimball moved and P. P. Pratt secondedthat a committee of three be appointed to make a selection ofHymns and Orson Pratt proposed and Willford Woodruffseconded that Brigham Young P. P. Pratt and John Taylorbe that CommitteeElder Willard Richards proposed thatthe name of the periodical be the Latter-day"Latter-day Saint's Millennial Star"George A Smith seconded this motionand Brigham motioned and Orson Pratt sustained that 
 him for the chapel to preach in. He said he had a school housewhich would ^hold^ 500 and that I might have that on Sunday. SoI gave out an appointment at Bowl Court 137 Thornditch. Iconversed with several others who received my testimonyand one woman said she would be baptizedI returned home by the way of Smithfieldmarket which covers about 20 acres of ground. It wasFair time and I never saw such a sight before. Therewere 20 acres of ground covered with cattle sheep andcaravans of beast of every name and large bands of musicbelonging to these "Shows" were playing to call the peopleto the exhibitions of the numerous manageries which hadgathered from all parts of the country to the SmithfieldMarket Fair. The^re^ was also a conglomeration of everythingthere. I thought, "Could a Missourian from the westernwiles of America whose Knowledge extended only to hisgun, corn, crib and hog-pen behold such a shight hewould think himself in another world and perhaps retireheart-sickened with the scene as I did; and no man wholoved virtue peace and retirement could feel otherwise inviewing a scene like the Smith field Market Fair. YetFairs are yearly heald in every part of the nation and infact they form one of the venerable institutions of theland. They are some of the "good old English relics" andare strikingly pictorial of "Merry England" of olden times^English^ Fairs are more plebian and belong more exclusively to thepeasantry and lower classes them English "Races". The latterthrough just as much a national institution of the peasantryand masses of England as the former also is a national institutionwith the higher classes. The English Race course is not onlycrowded with the tens of thousands of plebian stock but the crowds of nobility fashionable society and sportsman fromall the country around will be there gathered on race daysBut English Fairs and English Races from a moral point ofview are about on a level and there are none of the oldnational institutions of that country so illustrative of thetype of "Merry England" in olden times. They are infact pictorial to the last shade of colouring when viewed 
 the size and price of the paper be left with the Editor.On motions from Brigham Young seconded byHeber C Kimball and P. P. Pratt it was determined that the Saintswho desired to emigrate should receive a recommend from the Churchin Britian to the Church in America and that no one shouldbe recommended to go to America who had money unless theyassisted the poor according to the counisel of the Twelve.John Taylor motioned that the copyright ofthe Books of Mormon and Doctrine and covenants be securedas soon as possible. Parley P. Pratt sustained the motion;and Willford Woodruff farther moved that Heber C. Brigham YoungHeber Kimball and Parley be the committee to secure the copyrightWillard Richards sustained this motionHeber C. Kimball proposed and WillardRichards seconded that Elder Peter Melling be ordained an EvangelicalMinister in Preston.It was also proposed by Willard Richardsand seconded by Willford Woodruff that the Editor of the MillenialStar keep an account of all the receipts &c connected with printingand general expences and that the books at all times be open tothe inspection of the council of the Twelve.All the foregoing resolutions were unaminouslyadopted.The total number of the Saints in Englandand Scotland were 1671 including the Priesthood. The officialmembers were as followsElders 34; Priests 52Teacher 38; Deacons 8Total of Priesthood 132The Council of the Twelve closed itsfirst conference among the nations on the 16th of April havingbeen convened three days. I felt happy to have the privilegeof sitting with my brethren of the Twelve to consult uponthe establishing of the work of God among the nations andkingdoms of the earth and it was with much satisfaction thatI preached in the Temperence Hall to a crowded congregation on theevening of the second day of our Conference. 
 as fine illustrative panoramas of "Merry England" in genuine "goodold English times." Now a day they are but the holliday realitiesof the nation and are only relics of the past and not characteristics ofthe present but in olden times fairs and races were the nationalholliday pictures magnified of "Merry England" in every day lifeSmithfield Market Fair as viewed by me that day was one of thesepictorials of the merry days of yore. It is years the scene wasrepulsive to me but it was none the less illustrative of thenational characteristics of the past. In later years this fairwhich was known by the name of Bartholemew Fair wasabolished by the muncipal authorities of London.Visit to Westminster AbbeySeptember the 5th Elders Kimball Smith andmyself visited the Westminster Abbey. Here going throughevery appartment we saw all the toomes and monumentsof the Kings Queens Princes Lords and noted men who haveever been entommbed within its walls.One part of the Abbey was built in theyear 600 and has now stood over 1200 years. Most ofthe kings and queens of England are entoombed inWestminister Abbey who have died during those twelvecenturies.Here we saw what are esteemed perfectlikeness of Queens Elizabeth Mary and Ann, LordNelson Pitt and others. We saw the full coronationdress of Queen Ann and also the chair in which QueenVictoria and all the Kings and queens for the last eighthundred years were crowned. This chair of State iscovered with gold tissue and it contains a stone underthe seat in which all the Scottish chiefs and Scotland'sKings were crowned since they were a people. Fabuloustradition delclare this stone to be the identical stone thatwas Jacob's pillarIn this chair of State in which Royalty had sat tobe crowned during eight hundred years we sat thisday yet not with any extravigant reverance for the 
 1840CHAPTER XVI[twelve blank lines]As I am now entering upon thatpart of my labours in the English mission where I becameassociated with more of my brethren the Twelve in ourministry in a foreign land I will here open a newchapter by a briefSummary ViewofMy Mission in Herefordshireprior to the Council at Preston.Being led by the Spirit I visitedFroom's Hill Herefordshire on the 5th day of March 1840and commenced preaching the word of God unto the people andmany received my testimony.I commenced baptizing & In one month and five days Ihad baptised 158 souls.I baptized Mr Thomas Kingtonthe Superintendant of the Church of United Brethren whichcame out of the Methodist connection. I also baptizedforty-eight preachers of the United Brethren and one hundred 
 held at meeting in Tabernacle square, at 3 o'clock, in the afternoon at which Elders Kimball and Smith preached andI bore my testimony to their words. One man aroseand opposed us, and was angry because of the truth ofGod. He continued opposing, until the police stopedthe conversation.We met again in the evening at BowlCourt, to preach to the people, but when we got there wefound a plan contrived by several of the preachers forone of them to preach, lest some should beleive ourtestimony. When we found this, we went our way andfound four persons who received our testimony andoffered themselves for baptismNext day I wrote to Elder Browett ofmy Herefordshire field of labour and walked to BroCorner's and visited several other friends. Two offeredthemselves for baptism. I visited St Paul's and thenreturned home. Elders Kimball and Smith hadjust returned fromA Visit to the Rev. Robert AitkenHe received them kindly, acknowledged theirdoctrine true, but was affraid of deception. His mindwas in a disturbed state.In the evening we held a meeting inthe Temperance Hall; but we had almost the barewalls to preach to, there being only about thirty presentI preached to the few present for about an hour andElder Kimball followed me. After paying 7/6/ seven shillingsand six pence for the use of the hall we returned to ourlodgings.Part of the next day we spent invisiting places and things connected with the crown. Westarted out together and walked to King St. and UnionSt. and passed by Surry Chapel which was built andoccupied for many years by the celebrated Rowland Hillwhose body lies under this chapelFrom thence we continued to WestminsterBridge which brought us direct to Westminster Abbey 
 and twelve of the members of that Church.This threw into my hands under mysuperintendence forty-two places of worship already establishedand licensed according to law including one regular chapel.When I left this vast field of labour toattend Conference at Preston there was ^were^ nearly 200 more personsready to enter into the Church; and among those already numberedwith us were the preachers of the United Brethren before mentionedand one clerk of the Church of England and a number of wealthyfarmersThis opened the largest field of labourand was the greatest increase of the Church in the BritishMission and when I left this vast field of labour to go toPreston to attend Conference there were nearly two hundredmore souls ready to be baptized as soon as an opportunityoffered of whom after my return I found that Elder Kingtonhad baptized ten and Priest John Cheese twenty makingthe number of souls belonging to the Church in Herefordshireone hundred and eighty eight. I will now again take upthe regular thread of my history from my daily journalfor 1840.I had spent the 14th 15 and 16th of Aprilsitting in Council with my brethren the Twelve and the Saintswho ghad come up to this general conference of the BritishMission; and on the evening of the 20^15^th I preached in theTemperence Hall to a crowded congregationOn the 17th being Good Friday the Twelvemet at Penworthham two miles from Preston to visit theSaints and spend the day together before they seperated fortheir several fields of labour. Sister Moon opened a bottleof wine for us to bless and partake of. This bottle of wineshe had kept for forty years. After spending the dayin conversing about the things of the Kingdom of God wereturned to Preston.The time had come for the Twelve to seperateand go into different parts of the Lord's vinyard. It wasthought widsom for Elder Heber C. Kimble to visist the Churcheswhich he had built up while in England on his former 
 and the House of Parliament. We walked throughthe House of Lords and Commonsof England and sat in the chair in which the speakers of the houseof Lords had sat for many years. In this room all thespeeches were made by that great orator William Pitt concerningAmerica before the revolution. As the House of Commonswas burned down about six years before our visit this roomiswas then occupied by the Commons and there was anotherhouse built for the Lords at that timeOne would naturally suppose that aroom fitted up to contain the Lords and Commons ofEngland would be extraordinary grand and expensive butit is quite the reverse being exceedingly plain and undecoratedOn entering the room one would soonerthink he was in an American School House than inthe House of the Lords of EnglandNext we visited St James Park andsaw a company of two hundred foot soldiers the GrenadierGards on parade accompanied by a fine martial bandAfterwards we saw the Queen's Horse Guards on paradeone hundred in number with their bodies coveredwith steel which shone right martially. They worehelmets and breastplates of steel which glistening in thesun's rays made them appear as though they were encasedin polished armour; and they were mounted on powerfulblack mares whose glosy coats and high mettle wellbecame the pride and pomp of war. It would be hardto convince an Englishman that the Queen's Horse Guardswas not the finest regiment in the world. The chargeof the Guards at Waterloo is immortalized by the Wellingtonianhousehold tradition of "Up Guards and at them" which wonthat famous battle upon which the destiny of Europe hungand gave to the Iron Duke the crown of glory as conquererof Napoleon the Great. We may be told by thosewho are sceptical to popular traditions that the greatDuke never uttered this famous command and we may read that Welington himself was doubtful of the tradition stillthe masses will beleive it and the "Up Guards and at them!" 
 mission and O[r]son Pratt to go North on mission to ScotlandJohn Taylor was to continue his labours in Liverpool andParley P. Pratt to proceed to Manchester and publish theMillennial Star. (After years revealed that this newperiodical which was the first Church organ of foreign missionswas destined to live through many volumes and probablywill continue to be (as in 1865) the oldest periodical andofficial organ in the Church. At the date of this transcriptit has passed through the hands of numerous editors andhas reached its twenty seventh volume.)It was further arranged by the Twelvethat Elder G A Smith should go to the poteries andElders Brigham ^Young^ and Willard Richards go with me intothe field of labour which I had opened in Herefordshire andthe adjoining countryOn the 18th I parted from the rest ofthe Twelve who were to branch out in other directionsand with Brigham Young started on my return to myfields of labour. We took train a^nd^ journied to Manchesterand then continued by coach to Burslem where we spentthe night at brother JohnstonsNext day being Sunday Elder B.Young preached to the people of Hanly in the morningand evening and in the afternoon we communed withthe Saints and spent an interesting time. We spentthe night at Stoke with Brother Hulme.The following day we took coach atStoke and rode to Stafford and thence to Wolverhamptonwhere we stayed for the night and on the morrow weproceeded by coach to Dudly and had a good view of theold Dudly castle and from thence to Worcester in whichcity we spent several hours.Here we visited the ancient and notedWorcester Cathedral which surpassed for splendor andarchetecture anything which I had ever viewed. Its lengthis about 400 feet and this magnificient structure is between[blank space] and yet in stands in ourown days in stately grander for surpassing the archetectural 
 of Wellington will live side by side on the page of nationaltradition with Nelsons "England expects every man this dayto do his duty!" I thought the renowned Horse Guardsmost certainly a magnificient regiment any how. They areto the English Army what Napoleons "Old Guard" was to the^French^ but while the "Old Guard" of the Emperor was broken foreverat Waterloo, the Horse Guards of the grand Willingtoniancharge lived to do splendid service and maintain theirprestige in after years in the Crimean war fighting sideby side with the French whose Imperial head wasstill a Napoleon as before. This time they were aliesand not foes yet then the French won from the Englishsome of the glory lost at Waterloo in spite of the factthat the Queens Guards and the crack regiments of Englandnever behaved better, for instance that madly brilliantBalaclavia charge at the Light Horse of the English armyIn viewing and visitng the famous things and places ofLondon I always felt interested in their historical associationsand reminenscencesPassing from the martial view of theQueens Horse Guards we visited the monument errectedin honour of the Duke of York which was 135 feet inheight. Here I parted from Elders Kimball and Smith andwalked the whole length of St James' Park. It has afine pond in the centre and mansions and palacesaround.I first visited the palace of theQueen Dowager widow of William the Fourth next themansion of the Duke of Sumerset ^Somerset^ which was quitesplendid and then Buckingham Palace. This palacewas occupied by Her Majesty Queen Victoria and His HighnessPrince Albert. It covers a number of acres of groundand every door enterance and gate was strongly guarded byarmed soldiersI walked nearly around this palace andwhile doing so I had the privilege of seeingHis Royal Highness Prince Albert 
 of England there who manifested much of the Devil by stirringup mobs against the Saints which had in several instances muchdisturbed the meetingsOn the 16 I had joined Elder Kington inDymock and that evening we were to hold at his house theweekly prayer meeting of the Branch.As we began to gather together the beatingof drums and kettles were heard through the street and themob soon collected and paraded in front of the houseWe closed the window and shutters and doors in the house andI opened the meeting with singing and prayerBut we had no sooner commenced thanthe mob armed themselves with rocks bricks eggs and anything they could lay their hands upon and began to throwthem at the house like a shower of hailstones for nearlyan hour. They dashed in the windows scattered bricks andglass through the rooms broke the tiles of the roof andcontinued such depredations until the close of the meetingThe brethren being disposed to test the virtue of the lawswhich were strict against such outrages I proposed togo into the midst of the mob to see who they were butthey would not permit me lest I should receive injuryfrom the shower of stones. Several of the brethrenhowever went themselves and took down the names ofthe leaders and returned to the house in the midst of avolley of stones and brik-bats but without injury. Soon afterwards the mob broke up and having cleared the roomof the bricks stones and glass we laid down to restand had a good nightI was at Froom's Hill on the 18thand found the Saints in good spirits and learned thatElder Turley had sailed from Liverpool on the 8th with acompany of 200 Saints. Brother and Sister Benbowand the rest of the emigrant company were rejoicing in theLord and in their Zion bound journeyThe 20th was well spent and was aninteresting day. I preached at Froom's Hill and communed withthe Saints and also at Standly Hill. 
 monuments of this age.This cathedral contains many monumentsand marble sculptured figures over the toombs of ancient BishopsLords and Princes some of whom had laid there for sevenor eight hundred years. It is said that some of these monumentswith their marble sepulchre drapery are as neatly executed as anyfound in Europe. Almost everything about this magnificientchathedral from the dome to the basement is carved out of solidmarble. The pulpit is also hewn from solid stone. Thereis a large organ in the building and the Church of Englandhold service in it twice each day in the year. We staid during one service.From Worcester we rode to Ledbury andon the road we passed through the town of Malvern onMalvern Hill which commands the splendid prospectof all the surrounding country for thirty miles on someof the highest peaks of which are large entrenchments wheremen retreted in the time of the Roman invasion. The buildings in the village of Malvern are fine and verypicturesque in appearence standing on the side of these^hills^ Malvern is a noted place which the nobility and gentryof England visit in the Summer season. We hada view of Eastner castle as we past along. That nightwe spent at Mr Francis Pullins in LedburyOn the next day we walked to Froom'sHill and called upon brother John Benbow and had aninterview with Elder Kington. In the evening we held aChurch meeting at Stan^d^ly Hill to do Church business. Thiswas the first meeting at which Brigham Young waspresent in this district of country and I will therefore subjointhe following minutes from my Journal:Minutes of the First MeetingAttended By Brigham YoungIn HerefordshireStandly Hill BranchApril 22nd 1840 
 He rode from the palace across St James' Park mounted ona grey horse followed by his groom and was not accompanied byHer Majesty or any other person. He was dressed in a frock coatand dark pants. He looked fresh and healthy and in theyoung Spring of life being only twenty years of age. I did notsee Queen Victoria for she was at Windsor Castle at this time.I next visited the National Gallery andviewed its choice and extensive collection of the best paintings ofthe great masters of the art and afterwards St Martin's Churchwhen I concluded that I had seen as much as my brain couldcontain for one day. Three miles walk farther throughthe city brought me to Brother Corner's where I again joinedElders Kimball and Smith. We spent a little time with thefriends and returned to our lodgings and spent the night.My Return to HerefordshireNext day September the 9th I paid my bills and called upon the friends, in company of brothers Kimball and Smith,and the day following I parted from the brethren and friendsin London to return to Herefordshire.We had spent twenty three days inthat great Babylon of modern times and had found it harderto establish the Church there, than in any place wherewe had ever been. We had baptized one man, and ordainedhim a priest; and six others had given in their names tobe baptized on the following Sunday; and at this timethere was some little prospect of the Reverend Robert Aitkenreceiving the work. I, therefore, left London feeling thatour mission and labours had not been altogether in vainI took the omnibus three milesto the Great Western Railway Padington and at 9 o'clockstarted for Herefordshire and as I passed Windsor Castle andsaw the British flag flying from it as signal that herMajesty was there.Arriving at Cheltenham at 4 o'clockby coach from Farrinton road Station forty miles I metElder Browett and wife and several others of the Saints

Benediction from W. Woodruff 
 These two conferences, with their forty branchchurches, and over a thousand organized members, underthe direction of one hundred and thirteen ordained officers,had been raised up inwithin six months and a half. Surelythe work of God had been marvellous, unparalleledperhaps in the history of any new religious movementunparalleled in the foundation of Christian churches ofevery denomination either in ancient or modern timesTo God the Giver of the power and efficacy of ouradministration of the Gospel in Herefordshire and regionsaround be the glory and not unto the humble ministersof that workI meditated upon these things andin my journal of date Sept 21st 1840 I wrote thus:"This has been a busy day with me. Afterstanding upon my feet from morning till evening I amcalled to shake hands with hundreds of Saints with gladhearts and cheerful countenances. It is with no ordinaryfeelings that I meditate upon the cheering fact thata thousand souls have been baptized into the Newand Everlasting Covenant in about half a year in one fieldwhich God has enabled me to open. I pray Him to acceptthe gratitude of my heart for his mercies and blessingsunto me in this thing and enable me to stand withthese Saints and all the righteous in His Celestial Kingdom"This day I had stood upon my feeteight hours in conference conversed much of the time in suggesting^speeking^ motioning &c; ordained about 30 confirmed some healedmany who were sick shook hands with about 400 Saintswalked 2 miles and ended with 4 hours of chimney cornerpreaching. I then laid down to rest and dreamt ofcatching fish.Next day I was called upon to visita young man who lay dangerously ill and in dangerof the lockjaw from a cut of the ancle and bruiseof the knee. I rebuked the inflamation and pain ofthe body and he was made whole. I baptizedEdward Jones a Game keeper and confirmed two 
 Next day I walked from Turkey Hall to Forty Greenand wrote a letter to Lady Roberts a companion of thelady of Squire Dowdswell and sent it by the handof sister Brooks.Lady Roberts was of the nobility ofEngland and a lady of wealth, and had withdrawnfrom the Church of England and the travelled muchin search of truth looking for the fulfilment of theProphets.She became acquainted with the fulnessof the Gospel through a female servant in the employof Squire Dowdswell. She began to investigatethe subject; and the Spirit of God rested upon herand convinced her of the truth of the work. and sSheobtained the 4 numbers published of the MillennialStar and fearing that she should not be able toobtain them for herself, copied the whole of themwith her pen. She also read the Book of Mormonand copied a part of that, and became perfectlyconvinced of the truth of the work of which sheread, and said she would go a thousand milesbut what she would see some of the Twelve andbe baptized under their hands. and hHearing thatI was in London she was about to take a journeythere to see me, and the other brethren, and be baptizedShe had two brothers ministers of the Church ofEngland.Having returned from London, I, therefore, addressed her by letter upon the work of God, into whichat that time she was so earnestly entering, to whichshe returned me a verbal answer by Sister Brooks, thankingme kindly for the interest which I manifested in her welfare,and saying that she should address me by letter in a few daysElder Kington in Dymock had faithfullywarned the people and had succeeded in raising up achurch of fifty Saints. This had stired up theinhabitants of that place to much anger against usand especially the Rev. John Simons Rector of the church 
 The day following I was called upon to visit anotheryoung man who lay dangerously ill with the fever. Hecovenanted to keep the commandments of God and Ianointed him and rebuked the fever and he beganto recover. I also visited an aged Saint upon herdeath bed and blessed her. She was rejoicing inthe fulness of the Gospel in deathThe church ministers at this time were verymuch stirred up in this region because of the success of thework of God in the midst of the people and every exertionwere made by them to stay its progress. They were findingthat the Lord was delivering their flocks out of their handsand giving them unto the shepherds of the church of theSaints. They were alarmed and were holding conventionsand meetings to contrive plans and adopt means to over-throw the Latter-day Work of God which they understoodnot and beleived not yet feared its power. And wellindeed they might for in some instances they did nothave more than 10 or 15 at their churches on the Sabbathwhile around them on every hand they had seen fortyBranch^es^ of two organized conferences of the Church ofLatter-Day Saints spring up in about six months withover a thousand members and between one and twohundred officers ordained to scatter the ^seed of the^ Gospel everwhereupon the new broken ground of ^in^ this prolific fieldOn the 25th the time had come forme again to take leave of the Saints in my Herefordshirefield of labour. I wrote an address to Elders Kimballand Smith baptized one and confirmed two and aftervisiting the Saints until midnight I took the partinghand with them and started on my journey at 12 o'clockat night.I rode from Froom's Hill at night ina cart to Worcester 15 miles took coach and thence 40 milesto Wolverhampton. Here I rode 2 miles by the omnibusto the railroad Station and travelled by rail 30 milesto Whitmore Station where I again took omnibus 9 milesto Hanley and then rode in a gig to Burslem. 
 of the Saints. In thy land thousands of the Saints of God have been driven from place to place county to county and State to State and the blood of martyrs has been spilt for the testimony of Jesus: and when thy rulers have been petitioned for the redress of the wrongs of the Lord's people and thy citizens they have turned a deaf ear in their crysTherefore O America! thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting. From this time forth perplexityshall rest upon thee and confusion in thy government wisdom righteousness and truth shall depart from thy rulers and fully sit in thy Congress and thy shame shall be known among the nations of the earth. It shall bea vexation to understand the report of the sorrow andwoe that shall come upon thee by sword fire tempest earthquakes and pestilence from the hands of God until thy government is broken up and thou art destroyed as a nation from under Heaven.

CopelandDuring this Conference meeting we also broke breadwith the Saints and confirmed four and at 1/2 past 1o'clock in the evening ^we meet again^ and had the largest congregation which had assembled at our preaching place. One came forward for baptismThis was a day which we had long desired to see for we had laboured exceedinglyhard to establish a Church in London and at times it seemed as though we should have to give it up but by holding on to the work of our Divine Master and claiming the promises of God we were now to leave an established London Conferencewith a prosperous Church planted in the Metropolis under the care of our beloved brother Lorenzo Snow 
 are fixed and unalterable. For instance, He set the sun themoon and the stars in the heavens and gave them their laws conditions and bounds which they cannot pass except by his commands. They all move in perfect harmony in their sphere and order and are as wonders lights and signs unto us"The sea also has its bounds which it cannot pass. God has set many signs in the earth as well as in the heavens. For instance the oaks of the forest the fruit of the tree, the herb of the field all bear a sign that seed hath been planted there; for it is a decree of the Lord that every tree fruit or herb bearing seed shall bring forth after its own kind and cannot come forth after any other law."Upon the same principle do I contend that baptism is a sign ordained of God for every believer in Christ to take upon himself in order to enter into the Kingdom of God. "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God' [##John 3:5##] said the Saviour"As it is a sign and commandment which God hath set for man to enter into his Kingdom those who seek to enter in by any other way will seek in vainGod will not receive them neither will the angels acknowledgetheir works as accepted for they have not taken upon themselves those ordinances and signs which God ordained for man to receive in order to receive celestial glory. God has decreed that all who will not obey his voice shall not escape the damnation of hell. And what is the damnation of hell? Why to go and be numbered with that society who have not obeyed His commands.Baptism is a sign to God and to angels and to Heaven that we do the will of the Father and there is no other way ordained by God for man to come unto Him and any other course is vain. It is the decree of Heaven and ordained that man shall repent of all his sinsand be baptized for the remission of them.  Then he can come to God in the name of Jesus Christ in faith and obtain the promise of the Holy Ghost." 
 The day after the Conference I baptized oneand preached at Tunstell and on the next evening at Burslemto a crowded audience and the power of God rested uponme. Great solemnity pervaded the congregation. The Spirit of God was moving the people and they felt thatthe Lord was doing a work in their midstOctober ^1st^ 2nd I walked to Hanlyand thence to Stoke where I found George A Smithwho had just returned from London. We then went toLane End where we found brother Kimball. Afterpartaking of food we went to the water and baptizedtwo and thence to the preaching room where we met anoverwhelming congregation. I testified to them of thework of God and was followed by Elder Kimball. Thepower of the Almighty was upon the people and they felt that it was a day of warning and repentance. Sixwere confirmed and three baptizedNext morning Elder Kimball andmyself arose from our bed with the power of God resting upon us yea His Spirit was like fire shut up in our bones.I saidO my God why is thy Spirit thus upon me? Whyisare thmy eyes like a fountain? What art thou about to doO my God that causes this thing? I ask thee Fatherto tell it unto me in the name of Jesus Christ thy SonAnd the Spirit of revelation came upon me and I was answered"Thus saith the Lord God unto thee myservant Willford; This is my Spirit which resteth uponthee to enlighten thy mind to show thee things tocome and not only upon thee but upon all my faithfulservants upon the face of the whole earth saith the Lord.Mine indignation is about to be poured out withoutmixture upon all the nations of the earth and theyshall not escape. The cry of the poor the widowand the orphan ascendeth into mine ears saith the Lordand I am about to avenge the cry of mine elect bylaying low the oppressor and executing the decree ofmine heart upon all the ungodly amongst men 
 Brother Kimball on the 15th received a letter from his wife informing us that the Prophet Josephhad written for the Twelve to come immediately home for our personal safety and the next day we met with the Church previous to our parting with the London SaintsGreater excitement than ever prevailed throughout London and especially in the House of Parliament over the imprisonment of M. C. Cleod and the North Eastern Boundary question and Government secured determined on war and to every appearence hostilities between England and America seemed almost certain and it appeared as much ^as^ we should do to sail from Liverpool before war broke outI received a letter from Elder WmPitt containing 3 pounds and informing me that there was an appointment for me to preach in Bristol on the SundayDr Copeland introduced us by letter to the Overseer of the Library of Bartholimew Hospital which we visited and was very politely conducted by Dr Lyon through the variousdepartments of the Hospital and after visiting the Museum Lecture Rooms and other places we last of all visited the Dissecting Rooms where there ^were^ about twenty human bodies which the doctors were dissectingOn the same day I corrected the proof sheet of our Address to the citizens of London and in the evening our sitting room was full of Saintsas we were soon to leave London and they brought us some money and presents for our wives and childrenTwo days afterwards we baptized a Jew and Jewess.I was unwell that night and arose next morning quite ill but walked to the printing office and got three throusand copies of our Address to the citizens of London for which I paid three guineas 
 "What is the sign of the healing of the sick?The laying on of hands is the sign marked by James and the custom of the ancient Saints as ordained by the Lord; and we shall not obtain the blessing by pursuing any other course than that which God hath marked out. [##James 5:14-15##]What if we should attempt to gobtain the Holy Ghost through any other means except the sign or whay which God has appointed? Should we obtain it? Certainly not. All other means would fail. The Lord says do so and so and I will give the blessingThere are certain key words and sign belonging to the Priesthood which must be observed in order to obtain the blessingsThe sign of Peter was to repent and be baptised for remission of sins with the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost; and in no other way is the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained [##Acts 2:38##]There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Corneliusreceived the Holy Gost before he was baptized which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel; but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. [##Acts 10:44-48##] Had he not taken this sign, this ordinance upon himself the Holy Spirit which convinced him of the truth of God would have left him. Until he had obeyed the ordinance of baptism and received the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands according to the order of God he could not have healed the sick nor commanded an evil spirit to come out of a person and be obeyed for the spirit might say to him as to the sons of ^Seavey^ Peter I know and Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are ye? [##Acts 19:15##]It mattereth not whether we live long or short after we come to a knowledge of the principlesof the Gospel and obey them. I know that all men willbe damn'd if they do not come in the way which God 
 Therefore I put my Spirit upon thee and say unto thee, Liftup they voice and spare not and call upon all men torepent that come within the sound of thy voice andmany souls shall be given unto thee and great shallbe they reward and eternal shall be they glory saiththe Lord"The people were much stirred up throughoutthe Potteries and felt as they never felt before. I walked toStoke and preached to the people and the power of God rested uponus. Three were baptized and confirmedOn the 5th I took coach in company of EldersKimball and Needham for Manchester. I had a touch of theague on the way and had of the cholera the day beforeWhen I aArrived in Manchester I had aninterview with brothers Young Richards Orson Pratt and manyother brethren.Minutesof^At^ The General ConferenceheldAt ManchesterOct. 6th 1840^There were^ Present: of the Twelve Brigham Young Heber CKimball Willard Richards Orson Pratt George ASmith and Willford Woodruff: also 5 High Priests 19Elders 28 Priests 14 Teachers and 2 Deacons.The meeting was called to order at 10 o'clockby Brigham Young when it was moved by him andseconded by Wilford Woodruff that Orson Pratt be Presidentof the Conference which was carried unanimously GeorgeWalker chosen Clerk of the day.After singing and prayer there was ^were^ represented 27Conferences besides other Churches not yet organized into 
 I took the parting hand of Elder Kimball who this day left London. But my distress and pains of body increased throughout the day insomuch that my friends thought that I had caught the small-pox through administering to the daughter of brother Corner ^Morgan^Sunday I grew worse but Dr Copelandcoming to visit me said it was not the small pox but a severe attack of cold and fever. He prescribed for me and I began to recoverTwo days after I was better though still weak in body and only able to trace a few lines in my Journal with a feeble hand, and I was forced to fall back upon Elder Snow to write for me to Elder YoungLast evening the noble spirited and celebrated Temperance lecturer J. S. Buckingham finished his course of lectures concerning his tour through the United States which was delivered to a crowded audience Intreating upon the country goverment laws customs fashions religions sects and a variety of other matters he omitted the Mormons or Latter-day Saints although he had informed the public he should speak upon that subjectThis omission was in consequence of his having the day previous to his lecture received a letter from Dr Copeland including one of our Addressesto the citizens of London which clearly showed him that we were American citizens Elders of the Church and in the city and should have a knowledge of what he presented to the community concerning usEarly this morning Dr Copeland received a letter from J. S. Buckingham who acknowledge his ignorance concerning our cause and very much wished information by obtaining our writings. So I made him a present of the Book of Mormon the Millennial Star and other works hoping they may ^might^ do goodI walked out as far as brother Corner's and found myself very weak. Many friends came to see me in the evening. 
 has appointed."As concerning the resurrection I will merely say that all will come from the grave as they lie down whether old or young there will not be added to their stature one cubit neither taken from it all being raised by the power of God having spirit in their bodies and not blood"Children will be enthroned in the presence of God and the Lamb with bodies of the same stature as they were one earth having been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.They will there enjoy a fulness of that light glory and intelligence which is received in the celestial Kingdom of God."Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord for they rest from their labours and their works do follow them"Before closing the speaker called upon the vast assembly to humble themselves before God and inmighty faith prayer and fasting call upon his holy name that the inhabitants of that city might escape the power of the Destroyer that rideth upon the face of the earth and that the Holy Ghost may rest upon them and the earth ^be^ sanctified under their feet.After the close of the meeting the Prophet Joseph informed the congregation that he should attend to the ordinance of baptism in the river near his house at 2 o'clock and at the appointed hour the bank of the Missisippi was lined with a multitude of people and President Joseph Smith went forth into the river and baptized with his own hands about 80 persons for the remission of sins and what added joy to the occasion was that the first person baptized was Mr. L. D Wason a nephew of sister Emma Smith and he was the first of her kindred who had embraced the GospelAt the close of this interesting scene the administrator lifted up his hands toward heaven and implored the blessing of God to rest upon the people and verily the Spirit of God did rest upon the multitude to the joy and consolation of our hearts.After baptism the congregation again repaired to the grove near the Temple to attend to 
 Conferences. The representation stood as follows:Conferences and Churches 41E with members 3626; Elders 81 Priests 222Teachers 74; Deacons 26.This was an increase since the last Conference of theBritish Mission of Members 1113; Elders 25 Priests 96Teachers 15; Deacons 13.After the transaction of much other business themeeting was dismissed by prayerPresident, Orson PrattClerk, George Walker.Next day October 7th I sat in council with theTwelve and many other officers at the MillennialStar Office and in the evening we all attended adiscussion held at the Carpenter's Hall between a MrT [blank space] and Elder Alfred Cordon on the one sideto prove the Book of Mormon not true and baptismnon-essential to salvation. Elder Cordon sustained theaffirmative. The discussion was before 1500 peopleIn lighting the chandeliers before the meeting 12 of theglasses bursted. During the day I filled twomamouth sheets with an account of my travels fromMontrose to the present time to send by the hand ofElder Mulliner to E. Robinson and Don Carlos Smitheditors of the "Times and Seasons"In Council with the Twelve nextday at the house of Willard Richards and on the followingFather Peter Melling Patriarch of the Church in Englandbestowed a Patriarchal blessing upon my head and also uponthe heads of brother Willard Richards and his wife who twodays after became the mother of as fine a son as I eversaw. He was named Heber John RichardsThis was Sunday Oct 11th and we heldour usual meetings and in the evening Elder Brigham Young 
 I spent the 25 in paying my last visit to the Saints in London and preparing for my departure and in the evening I preached for the last time in London before my return to NauvooNext day I parted with ^from^ Elder LorenzoSnow and the London Saints and took train at the Great Western Station for Bristol. I rode by rail to Wolton Basset eighty miles and then took coach 36miles to Bath. The road was very badBath is the most striking placeto the eye of the Traveller that I ever saw. The city extends to the summit of two high hills Beechen Clift and Bacon Hill and fills the valley between The city is a very ancient antique looking place and very picturesquely situatedI again took train at Bath to Bristol and arriving called at No 12 Redcliff Crescent Bedminster Parish where I found Elder Thomas Kington and all his household and also Elder Pittall of whom I was glad to meet.The city of Bristol is a notedplace and one of England's capital ^principal^ cities. Here I found a small branch of the Church of Latter day Saintsraised up numbering thirteen souls.On Sunday though still labouring under a sever cold I preached for the first time in the city of Bristol in the afternoon and evening. I preached in the Theatre which was crowded to overflowing with persons to hear me. There was good attention paid and I felt that many souls would embrace the work in BristolNext day was the first of March andMy BirthdayThis was the first day of Spring and I was 34 years of age. My severe cold continued to afflict me much. I spent the day with brother Kington and the next ^(2nd)^ was somewhat better when I again preached 
 the ordinance of confirmation; and notwithstanding thatJoseph had spoken in the open air and stood in the waterand baptized so many about 56 of those baptizedreceived confirmation under his hands and during theintermission of the meetings there was probably asmany more baptized and confirmed for their dead relativesat the font by the Twelve. H. C Kimball baptized about40 and I assisted in confirming 20. It was truly aninteresting dayOn the Sunday following a largeassembly met in the grove near the Temple whenElder Amasa Lyman addressed the assembly andwas followed by the Prophet Joseph who proved fromthe Bible the doctrine of baptism for the deadAt the close the congregation againassembled upon the bank of the river and Joseph wentinto the water and baptized all who came unto himAs I considered it my privilege to be re-baptized forthe remission of sins not having had the benefit ofthe ordinance since administered to me by Elder ZerahPulsipher when I entered the Church I went forth intothe river and was baptized under the hands of Josephthe Prophet. Likewise did John Taylor and manyothers and Joseph called upon me to assist him andI did so baptizing twelve. Then the Prophet liftedup his hands to heaven and blessed the people andthe Spirit of God rested upon the congregation. Andafter the multitude had gathered again to the groveElder Taylor and myself were confirmed ^by the laying on^ with the gift of^of hands^ the Holy Ghost and we then commenced to confer thelike blessing upon others confirming others.On the next day Elder LymanWight landed in Nauvoo with about one hundred andseventy Saints mostly from England and three thousanddollars worth of property for the benefit of the Templeand Nauvoo House 
 preached to about 1500 persons. We commenced a letter historical andreligious to E Robinson and Don Carlos SmithNext day Elders Young Kimball Richards GeorgeA Smith and myself purchased a broad cloth cloak just alike. Ispent some portion of the day in reading the proof sheet of the Book of Mormon: so also I did the day followingThe work of God had progressed in the town ofManchester the Elders had preached in the streets and the ministersof the day especially the Methodists were full of malice and thespirit of persecution was manifestingI parted with Brothers Richards, Youngand Kimball and took coach to Burslem on the 14th andon the morning arose refreshed by sleep and better in bodythan I had been on the previous day.But my mind was troubled for the Spiritmanifested much discomfort and persecution among the Saintsthroughout Europe and America and that many will fallaway: also that the "Powers that be" in America will rise upagainst the Church and that it will be again driven andthat while trouble lay in the future before the people ofGod greater calamities awaited the worldThis same spirit rested at that time uponthe Elders and Saints generally in the British Mission andthere was mourning because thereof and multitudes ofthe Saints were receiving testimonies of the clouds which weregathering over the Church and afterwards over the whole worldfor judgment begins first at the House of God.There is no doubt that the Lord was beginningat this time to manifest what in a few years afterwardscompleted the blackest written page of our history in the cruelmartardom of Joseph and his brother Hyrum the Prophet andPatriarch of the Church and the merciless exterminationof the Saints from NauvooConcerning the testimonies of calamitiesto fall upon the world direful wars to be poured out uponall nations the bloody civil war and rebellion in Americawhich should resemble the former history of that continentas related in the Book of Mormon when two great divisons 
 and for the last time in the Theatre in Bristol. There were many present and as before good attention was paidThe following day ^(3 mar)^ I took a walk with Brother Kington through the city of Bristol; after which we visited the suspension bridge then being errected across the river Avon at St Vincent's Rocks CliftonThis Suspension Bridge is 100 feet high and 700 feet in length. There was a bar and two ropes extending across from pillar to pillar and persons could only pass over in a basket one or two at a time. This basket goes on rollers or wheels and almost with the speed of a steem engine. I saw several pass over in this wayAt this place there were some of the greatest curiosities in the petrified stones formed from the various shells fish worms and other living creatures of the sea which had been transformed into fossels of beautiful figures and colours. I purchassed some small specimens and afterwalking over and viewing the sea we returned having a look of ^on^ the Great Western the first steem ship which crossed the Atlantic.After we had returned home I went to the water and baptized a lady by the name of Howell and confirmed her at the room where we had a good time. I laid my hands upon many and blessed them. I blessed Elder Kington and all his household.Next day ^(4th)^ I parted from the Saintsin Bristol and took coach and rode to the "passage"over the river Severn which I crossed in a passenger boat and again took coach to the town of CheapstowMonmouthshire Wales. I arrived here at 11 o'clock & spent three hours in this noted town. I visited the old famous Cheapstow Castle in which it is said that Oliver Cromwell was imprisoned for a season. This castle is very antique and partly in ruins and there are many of the same kind in Wales built for defence against the English but it is evident from their construction situation and location that they were 
 Minutesof theGeneral Conference of the Church in NauvooApril 6, 1842The day was rainy and the Conference did notmeet until 1 o'clock p.m. President Hyrum Smith occupiedthe time mostly through the remainder of this day givinginstructionThe following morning was also rainyand the Conference did not re-assemble until 1 o'clock inthe afternoon.A variety of subjects was presented to thecongregation by the First Presidency and the Twelve, andthose who desired to be ordained to the office of Elderwere called upon to come forward and give in their namesMany obeyed the call.The sun arose pleasantly on the nextday and Conference continued at 10 o'clock in the morningElder Lyman Wight Presidents Joseph Smith & Hyrumand others spoke.Then those who were to be ordainedElders were requested to withdraw by themselves fromthe congregation and they did so and six of the Twelvenamely Brigham Young Heber C Kimball Orson PrattLyman Wight Willard Richards George A. Smith andmyself went forward and ordained two hundred and seventy five to the office of Elders.This was truly an interesting time. MoreElders were ordained on this day than were ever before inthe Church of Latter-day Saints ordained in one day.While this was going on Elder Taylor was ^from^^the stand^ delivering a discourse to the multitude and there wereothers baptizing and confirming at the same time atthe font and elsewhere. 
 of one original people like the North and South about anhialateeach other such had been the prophesies and testimoniesof the Elders and Saints from the beginningSoon indeed were the forebodings of theSpirit concerning the dark and tempesteous clouds loomingin the future fulfilled in the rapid development ofevents monumentous to the church and the whole worldFirst came the troubles of the Saints at Nauvoo endingwith the dark and bloody page in our history of assassinand extermination of the Saints from the civilized worldQuickly followed the rising of all Europe in revolution andfrom that to the awful struggle between the North andSouth such a rapid succession of great startling & direevents enough to fill in the history of half a dozen centuries.I left the Staffordshire Potteries onthe 16th with Bro Cordon and preached in Birminghamthat night which was the first time I ever preachedin that great town. At this time there were fourSaints in Birmingham and several others ready for baptism. I felt that there would be a great workdone in that town.Next day I took the rail atBirmingham at 10 o'clock a.m. and arrived in Londonat 3 o'clock p.m. At the station I took the omnibusto brother Corner's where I found Elder George A SmithWe were glad to meet with each other once more.We hired lodgings board and sittingroom at No 40 Ironmonger Row St Luke's. Everythingwas dear and we found that with the greatest economywe could not do with much less than a pound per weekfor each.What few Saints there were in Londonat that time were very poor and not able to assistus but we hoped the Lord would soon open the wayin that great Babylon of the nation that His workmight roll forth. It was however certainly the darkestprospect before us of any place I had ever been in since 
 designed for defence against stones and arrows and belonged to an age prior to that of cannon ballFrom thence by coach 16 miles to Monmouth the capital of Monmouthshire through an exceedingly mountaineous country. Much of the route was by the windings of the River Y [blank]. The coachman ran his horeses down the mountains which would have endangered our lives had not the roads been goodWhen I arrived at Monmouth Elder James Morgan was waiting my coming and had given out an appointment for me to preach in the town at 7 o'clockat the house of Robert Davis. There was a crowded meeting and many could not get into the house. Four offered themselves for baptism. The Spirit witnessed to me that there would many embrace the Gospel in Monmouthshireand I said, "The harvest is great and the labourers few.I arose in the morning ^5th^ refreshed by sleep and having taken breakfast with Mr MastonI walked ten miles throug^h^ mud and water in a driving March rain storm to sister Mary Morgan at littleGarway where I found a pleasant family of the Saints.We were drenched with rain but found a good fire & spent the day comfortably and in the evening I had an interesting itnerview with Elder LittlewoodThe next day ^6th^ at Sister Morgan's reading the History of Rome with much interest and and in the evening I met the officers of the Church there in council and had a good timeSunday ^7th^ I preached in the morning at the house of Bro Thomas Rook and in the evening at the Kitchen upon the Book of Mormon and had the place fullThe Garway Conference^held^ March 8th 1841 
 In the afternoon Elders Amasa Lyman and Wm.Smith occupied the stand and waere followed by Joseph witha few remarks and the Conference closed.On the following day the Saints inNauvoo assembled at the house of President Marks topay their last respects to the remains of Ephraim hissonA large procession formed two by twoand walked to the grove where a great concourse of thecitizens haassembledThe Prophet Joseph spoke upon theoccassion with much feeling. Among his remarkshe said:"It is a very solemn and awful time.I never felt more solemn. It calls to my mind thedeath of my oldest brother who died in New York and of my youngest brother Carlos who died in NauvooIt has been hard for me to live on earth and seethose young men upon whom we have leaned assupport and comfort taken from us in the gloryof their youth. I have sometimes felt that I shouldhave been more reconciled to have been called myself ifGod had so willed it. Yet I know we ought to be stilland know that it is of Him and be reconciled"All is right. It will be but a shorttime before we shall all in like manner be called. Itmay be the case with me as well as with you. Somehave supposed that brother Joseph could not die but thisis a mistake. It is true there have been timeswhen I have had the promise of my life to accomplishsuch and such things; but having accomplished thosethings I have not at present any lease of my life andam as liable to die as other men"The Prophet made many other remarksof a similar kind and President Sidney Rigdon closedThe body was then conveyed to the grave in solumnsilence and each as they passed by droped a branchof evergreen into the grave 
 I had entered the vineyard. But the Lord was with us andwe were not discouraged.Sunday we met with the Saints at BroCorner's three times read in the Book of Mormon gave instruction andbroke bread unto them. We had a good time though there wasonly about half a dozen present. I felt the Spirit bear testimonythat there would be a work done in LondonI fell asleep having retired to rest in goodseason and slept until 12 o'clock (midnight) when I awoke and meditated upon the things of God until 3 o'clock in the morningand while forming a determi[n]ation to warn the people in Londonand overcome the power of darkness by the assistance of Goda person appeared unto me whom I consider was the Princeof Darkness. He made war with me and attempted totake my life. He caught me by the throat and nearlychoaked me to death. He wounded me in my foreheadand I also wounded him in a number of places in the headAs he was about to overcome me I prayed to the Fatherin the name of Jesus Christ for help. I then had powerover him and he left me though much wounded. Afterward,a ^three^ persons dressed in white came to me and prayed withme and I was immediately healed of all my wounds anddelivered of all my troubles.Next day George A Smith andmyself spent several interesting hours in visiting the British Museum. In company with the rest ofmy brethren of the Twelve who attended the General Conferenceof July I had visited the Manchester Museum and to-day I had a greater treat in spending a few hoursin one of the most worthy places in the world for atraveller's note. The following is my synopsis of the historyand our inspection of theBritish MuseumThe British Museum originated with thewill of Sir Hans Sloane who besides a large libraryof books and manuscripts had accumulated the 
 I met the Garway Conference at the ^Kitchen.^ Elder Levi Richards was chosen President and Elder James MorganClerk.There were present one of the quorum of the Twelve one High Priest seven Elders eleven Priests two Teachers and one DeaconThe meeting opened by prayer by Elder Woodruff after which the churches were represented as follows:   members Elders Prst: Teachs Deacs    Garway 1304 3 1 2 1    Arcop 12 0 2 1 0    Ewis Harrald 8 0 1 0 0    Longtown 10 1 1 0 0    Total 134 4 5 3 1     After the representation it was motioned that John Needham be ordained Elder William Morris Priest and Thomas Rough TeacherThese were ordained under the hands of Elders Woodruff and Richards.The meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock and one was baptized.In the afternoon Elder Levi Richards spoke and I followed him. After meeting the Saints contributed one pound to help me and I sold them 3 Books of Mormon and fifty Addresses to the citizens of London. I then walked 5 miles with brother Richards to brother Holleys and spent the night. This was the first time I had seen Brother Levi for about two yearsNext day in company of Elders Levi Richards and Thomas Pitt I walked to the city of Hereford where Elders Kay and others had been preaching. andthe people were much stirred upOn Sunday a preacher arose before two or three thousand in the Market House and informed the multitude that he had a fresh letter direct from America showing the origin of the 
 On Sunday a large congregation met at the groveWilliam Law addressed the assembly for about an hourThen Joseph the Seer arose in the powerof God and reproved and rebuked wickedness before thepeople in the name of the Lord. "I wish to say a fewwords to suit the condition of the general mass and I shallspeak with the authority of the Priesthood in the name of theLord God which shall prove a savior of life unto life or ofdeath unto death"Notwithstanding this congregation profess to be Saints yet I stand in the midst of all characters and allclasses of men"If you wish to go where God is you mustbe like Him or possess the principles which he possessesfor if we are not drawing towards God in principle weare going from Him and drawing towards the Devil"Search your hearts and see if you are like God. I have searched mine and feel to repent of my ^all^ sins"We have thieves among us, adulterersliars hypocrites. If God should speak from heavenHe would command you not to steal nor to commitadultery nor to covet not deceive but to be faithful overa few things"As far as we degenerate from God wedescend to the Devil and lose our knowledge and withoutknowledge we cannot be saved"While our hearts are filled with eviland we are studying evil there is no room in them forgood or for the studying of good"Is not God good? Then be you good.If He is faithful, then be you faithful. And to yourfaith virtue and to virtue knowledge and seek for everygood thing. The Church must be cleansed and I proclaimagainst all iniquity"A man is saved no faster thanhe gets knowledge; for if he does not get knowledgehe will be brought into captivity by some evil power 
 largest collections of natural History and works of artof any of his time. These he directed should beoffered after his death to the British Parliament. Hedied in 1753 and the offer was accepted and the actof 26 George II which directed the purchase of the collectionof Sir Hans Sloane also directed the purchase ofthe Harleian Library of Manuscripts and enactedthat the Cottonian Library which had been givento the Government in the reign of William III shouldwith these form one general collection. In thespring following the death of Sir Hans Montague House was purchased as a repository for the wholeand it was determined that the new institutionshould bear the name ofThe British Museum.Till the arrival of the Egyptian Antiquities fromAlexandra in 1801 Montague House was sufficientfor the reception of its acquisitions. Most of theEgyptian monuments were too massive for a privatedwelling and this first suggested the necessity ofan additional building which was rendered still moreindispensible by the purchase of the Townley Marblesin 1805. A gallery adequite for the reception ofboth was completed in 1807 and in 1823 upon thedonation of George the IV of the Library of George IIIGovernment ordered the errection of the present buildingknown as The British Museum of which the oldbuilding Montague House forms the general frontFrom time to time the originalhas been added unto until the British Museum whenwe visited it covered five acres of groundThough I felt interested in viewingevery appartment of this famous Museum whichcontains the greatest collection in the world yet I feltmore deeply interested in that part called the Galleryof antiquities especially the Egyptian department Theantiquities consisted mostly of the Greek Roman JewishEgyptian and some British 
 Book of Mormon. So he read the old Spalding storyWhen he got through Elder Levi Richardsarose and informed the people that instead of its being a new story it had been published for two ^seven^ years throughout the United States and also throughout ^in^ England. This caussed a great uproar for while some were for driving the man out of the place for lying others were crowdingaround Elder Richards and Kay to hear them preachThe crowd however was so exited that they left the ground with hundreds following them.There never was a time when the people were so much stirred up and eager to hear the Latter-day Saints than ^as^ at the present and it was expected that we should not get through the city without having crowds around us. We did however and had a view of Hereford Cathedral as we passed along and reached Sister BuftonsThere was at this time a small Branch of the Church at Hereford numbering seven members.We parted wifrom Brother Pitt at Hereford and continued to Lugwardine where I met with the Church for the last time and preached from the ##Isaiah 24|24 ch of Isaiah##.On the morrow I walked to Shucknell Hill and had an interesting meeting with the Saints and preached upon the gathering to Zion and Jerusalem. It was my last meeting with them and I bid them farewellNext day I walked to Standley Hill and dined with Brother Oa^c^key whom I was truly glad to see once more. We went together through Standly Hill and called upon the SaintsIt was Six months had passed since I had parted from the churches in this region but now I was again in the field where the Lord by his blessing and the power of the Holy Ghost had made my labours so abundantly fruitful. I had 
 in the other world. Evil spirits have more knowledge andconsequently more power than many men on earth. Henceit needs revelation to assist us and give us knowledgeof the things of GodWhat is reason that the Priestsof the day do not get revelation? They ask only to consume it upon their lusts. Their hearts are corrupt andthey cloke their iniquity by saying there is no morerevelations. Yet if any revelations are given of Godthey are universally opposed by the Priests andChristendom at large for it reveals their wickednessand abominations."Many other remarks were alsomade by Joseph.The Nauvoo LegionThe Nauvoo Legion met on Parade on the7th of May. The whole Legion was mustered andit consisted of 23 companies. The Legion that dayon parade numbering not much less than 2 thousandmen and officers mostly all ^in^ well dressed uniform trulymade a splendid appearance. General Joseph Smithhad provided a sumptious dinner for the whole staffwith their ladiesA steam boat landed at noon, under the salute of the martial band, and landedabout forty Saints mostly from Herefordshire EnglandThe second Sunday followingI attended meeting at the Grove and in the afternoonpreached. This was the first time I had spokento the Church at head quarters for two yearsAt the close of the meeting with brotherCharles C. Rich I went to the font and ^we^ baptized^I was also baptized for^ about one hundred persons mostly for the dead.At this time I was baptized for my great grandfather Josiah Woodruff andmy great grandmother his wife. This was 
 The Portland Vase is perhaps the choicest of the antiquitiesbeing the only article of the kind known in the world. It was foundtwo miles and half from Rome in the middle of the sixteenth centuryand for more than two hundred years it formed the principalornament of the Barberini Palace. The material of which thevase is made is glass. The figures which are executed in relief areof a beautiful opake white and the ground of a dark transparentblue. This superb specimen of Greek art was deposited in theBritish Museum in 1810 by the Duke of PortlandAmong the Egyptian antiquities are a largenumber of toombs coffins mummies hiyeroglyphics & papyri enoughif translated into the English language to make a hundred vols.as large as the Bible. In this part I felt more interestedthen in any thing I saw as they were from three to fourthousand years old and would no doubt if translated haverevealed many most valuable and glorious things historicaland sacred concerning the early ages of the world and of AbrahamJoseph Moses and Israel in Egypt and then what a worldof information they doubtless contained of their mysteries theirscience and traditions of the origin of man the biographiesof Adam Noah and the first Patriarchs of our race andof the institutions of religion recorded by the profound and learned priesthood of Egypt.Having formed an intimate acquaintance with one of the Overseers of the gallery ofAntiquities he explained many things to us concerningwhat we saw which were very interestingWe saw the toomb said to bethat of Alexander the Great and among many thousandother things was Napoleon's snuff box which costthree hundred guineas a piece of the Tower of Babelmany lamps from Babylon relics from the ruinsof Herculaneum & Pompei and a bronze statue ofNero when he was young with antiquities and inscriptionsfrom Athens and an endless variety of articles fromall the ancient cities of Greece Rome Egypt andJerusalem. Many of the ancient relics do not differmuch in shape from corresponding things of modern days 
 returned to meet the flock once more whom the Lord had given me to be their Shepherd for a season, I had come to sit in council and Conference with the shepherds left to watch over them and I had come to bid them farewell till we met again in Zion, the home of the Saints.From Standly Hill we went to Ledbury and held a meeting with the Saints. Sister Fidler was present she had been in Lord Summers family from a child but was now rejected for receiving the fullness of the Gospel. Lord Summers had since died and his son had commanded her soon to leave his house. By letter from Elder Glover we heard that Elders Orson Hyde and G. J. Adam had just arrived in England from New York.Next day I wrote letters to Elders Young and Snow and then went to Greenway and preached, blessed a child confirmed a member and administered the ordinance of the Gospel to five sick persons; and on the morrow I continued to Turkey Hall.Here on the Sunday I communed with the Saints and preached to a large congregation upon the gathering. I found the Saints in the region around very desirous to gather to the body of the Church but they were poor and had not the meansConference at Gadfield Elm ChapelOn the 15th day of March 1841 the Bran Greenand Gadfield Elm Conference again assembled when the meeting was called to order by Elder WoodruffThere were present one of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles 1 High Priest 10 Elders 21 Priests 10 Teachers and 1 Deacon besides the congregation of the Saints

At the same time I wasbaptized by him in behalf of my grandfather Eldad Woodruffand grandmother Dinah Woodruff; and I also baptized mywife Phebe for her Grandfather Joshua Fabyan and grandmotherSarah Fabyan and her great-uncle John Fabyan.

At this time I baptized my wife for her uncle John Fabyan andaunt Sally Fabyan and her uncle George Fabyan and uncle Joseph Fabyan. I also baptized Brother John Benbow for six of his dead kindred and his wife forsix of her dead friends.On the 14th of the following month June, I sat in council with the Twelve and we decided thatElder Hiram Clark should go to Liverpool and take theplace of Elder Fielding who was to return with his familyto NauvooFour days afterwards the citizens of Nauvoo both male and female to the number of manythousands assembled in Mass Meeting at the Grovenear the Temple.Joseph the Seer arose and spoke ingreat plainness concerning the corruption and wickedness ofGen. John Cook Bennet. He also prophesied that ifthe merchants of the city and the rich did not open theirhearts and contribute to the poor they would be cursed bythe hand of God and cut off from the land of the living 
 Two days after we took an interesting tour calledupon several persons had a view of the Palaces of St Jamesand stroled into Hyde Park visited the Lowther Bazaar theonly subterran^i^en exhibition in London. We returned homeand held a prayer meeting at brother Corner'sNext day we hired Mr. J. Barrett's AcademyKing's Square Goswell Street for three months to preachin and I went to the printer and got 500 hand bills printedto publish our place of worship and on my return ElderSmith presented me with three letters to read and No 10 of the Times and Seasons. The letter from Father JohnSmith to his son George A. informed me of the death ofmy daughter.In the evening of the same dayin company of Elder George A Smith I attended a Missionary meeting of the Wesleyan Methodist connectionin their chapel City Road. It was considered one of the greatestMissionary meetings ever held in the city of London andthe chair was filled by the Lord Mayor. He wasa noble looking man and the insigna of office whichhung about his neck consisted of six gold chains whichwere large and heavyThe object of the meeting was forthe Wesleyan Methodist to send out foreign missionariesand to make collections enough to clear themselves ofa debt of  50,000. The best talents of Europe weregathered together on this occassion. Ministers of theChurch of England and of Scotland were present besidesnumerous ministers of the Methodist connectionThere was much policy manifested in this combinationof the ministers of the different churches and theirinfluence for the purpose of raising means.I heard speeches from 10 to 12 ministersOne from the Scotch church as he arose and addressedthe chairman and meeting said"My Lord and Wesleyan friends, letmy tongue cleave to my mouth and my right handforget its cunning when I will not take a Wesleyan by

 The main portion of the day was taken up withthe business of the "Agricultral and Manufacturing Society"which was established under the charter granted by the Legislaturewith a view of helping the poorJoseph also commanded the Twelveto organize the Church more according to the law of God:that is to require of those who come in to be settled accordingto their council and also to appoint a committee to waitupon those who arrive make them welcome and counselthem what to do. Brigham Young Heber C KimballGeorge A Smith and Hyrum Smith formed the committee to settle the emigrants.The Nauvoo Masonic Lodgeassembled at the Celebration of St. John on the 24th^of June^ at 9 o'clock in the morning at the store of JosephSmith where the visiting brethren were received. The procession was formed and marched to the Stand in theGrove near the Temple. There were present aboutsix thousand persons. Sidney Rigdon delivered an appropriate address and we then returned to the Lodgewhere we dispersed for refreshment and re-met at2 o'clock in Lodge capacitySunday the 3rd of July aboutsix thousand persons assembled and was addressedby Joseph the Seer from the ##Daniel 7|7th Ch. of Daniel## concerningthe Kingdom of God to be set up in the last days.On the 4th of July the NauvooLegion met and celebrated the dayI preached in the afternoon of Sundaythe 187th and at the close of the meeting I went to thefont and confirmed about one hundred most of whomwere baptized for the deadThe time had come when there was again excitement throughout the land againstthe Saints. This excitement had arisen partly becausethe citizens of Nauvoo were disposed to exercise the 
 the hand and call him brother!"A minister of the Church of England said"My Lord and Wesleyan friends I wish you while lookingat the Church of England to cover her imperfections with the cloak of charity" . . . "I would readily cover the imperfectionsof the Wesleyan society but I know not where they are. I would not hesitate to cover the imperfections of the Churchof Rome were it in my power but they are all scarlet"A Wesleyan minister then arose and said"We are highly favoured on this occassion by having"for our chairman the Lord Mayor of London the chief"Magestrate of the most renowned city in the world"and his Lordship has like Caesar submitted himself to"the worship and acknowledgement of Christ in this condescention"But when rightly considered is not my Lord as highly honouredin presiding over this vast body of respectable citizens thisevening who have met together on so important an occassionas he would be to reign upon a throne for the angels inheaven honour every effort that is made on earth for thespread of the Gospel and the saving of the souls of menMy Lord and Christian friends How did the ancientApostles prevail? They were illiterate and had neithermoney nor influence and their doctrines were unpopularyet they established the Gospel maintained the doctrine ofChrist and caused the nations to tremble; but this wasall by the power of God and not of man. My Lordour circumstances are different from theirs. We haveinfluence and wealth we have splendid chapels and respectablebodies and our numbers are many yet if God is not withus we cannot prevail." (I shouted Amen)Thus speech after speech was made until10 o'clock when a collection was made after which theLord Mayor arose and addressed about 3000 personsin the city Road Chapel which was the first chapel everbuilt by the immortal John Wesley. The Lord Mayorsaid"It is with pleasure that I have been permittedto preside over this respectable body this evening on so 
 We had a very interesting time at the Conference and a large assembly of the Saints. It was the last ^time^ that I should attend in that part of my old and beloved field of labour during my present mission to England and whither or not I should ever meet here a conference assembly of Saints again was one of the secrets of my future left to time to reveal.We had held our meeting without disturbancefrom the mob who were present for they were kept quiet by the Police in attendance, who were in disguise, butafter the closing of the conference meeting a scene followed not easily described in which the Saints and myself werethe actors.I had escaped the mobbing of the wicked but now if I may so describe it I was fairly mobbed by the brethren and sistersNo sooner had the meeting closed than multitudes of the Saints crowded around me and hands were presented me on every side to bid me farewellMany called for me to bless them before I departed. others cried out "Lay hands upon me and heal me before you go." One came with, "Brother Woodruff I am turned out of doors for my religion. What shall I do?" Another with "I am ready to go to Zion but my wife wont go with me. Shall I leave her to gather with the Saints?"A wife in turn says "My husband beats me and turns me out of doors because I have been baptized. I have money enough to carry me and the children to Zion will you let me go without him?" "Brother Woodruffmy mother is over 80 years of age and has willed me 60 pounds at her death but will not emigrate with me Must I stay for her to die or leave her now to go with the Saints?" One said, "I have sold my little place and shall have 30 pounds to-morrow but must go out into the street. I have not enough to carry my family to America. Can you help me to a few pounds or tell me what to do? And an Elder cried out "How much longer must I preach in England before you will let me 
 rights which the Constitution of the United States guaranteedto them in common with all other citizens namely inattending the elections and voting for whom they pleasedIt was also partly in consequence of John C. Bennet who hadbeen cut off the Church for his wick^ed^ness and corrupt deedsand had gone forth into the regions around stiring up strifeagainst the Church by lying against Joseph and others.At this date the office of the Times andSeasons needed a new stock of paper and other materialsfor printing and binding which could not be purchased nearerthan St Louis and Joseph appointed me to go to thatcity to purchase the new supplySo on the 23rd of July I went up tothe Steamboat landing to watch for a boat and tarriednear by for four days at brother Lyman Wights whenmyself and Messrs Ashton and Moulton took passage onboard the GalenaWe found the boat heavily loaded with ledand the water being low we soon saw that we should have a slow journey.The boat crossed to Montrose andunloaded into lighters and the hands had a tremendiousfight while doing so.Next day we sailed to Nashville andover the rapids to Keokurk and ran upon the rocksmany timesNext morning we left Keokurk in rainyweather and after we had passed Tully the boat ran upona sand bank and lay till next morning when we gotoff and after passing Marion City the boat ran uponanother Sand bank which hindered her course forsix hoursI took a severe cold which settled intothe Bilious Fever and was exceedingly ill the remainder of thejourney.We arrived in St Louis on the 2nd ofA^u^gust. I had suffered severely and my face was frightfullyspotted by Musketoes 
 important an occassion the memory of which will be indeliblyfixed upon my mind as one of the most pleasing eventsof my life and I trust I shall ever be as ready to performevery duty required of me by the citizens of Londonas I have been to meet with our Wesleyan friends thisevening." The house rang with applause.But in the midst of all this whocan imagine my feelings? None only those in likecircumstances to myself. Here was I with a missionand a message from the Lord to the inhabitants ofLondon and stood in their midst ready to deliverit as soon as He should open the way yet Iwas as little known to them as was Jonah tothe citizens of Ninevah while in the whale's bellyNotwithstanding this great display of talant powerand policy to send missionaries to the heathenthey as much needed an humble messenger ofGod to teach them the Gospel of Jesus Christ inits primative character as Ninevah did a Prophetto cry repentance unto its inhabitants. I retired homealone reflecting upon these things.Two days afterwards we circulatedand posted our hand bills which contained the followingcopy of the First placard of the Church in London"He that judgeth a matter before he heareth is not wise"The Latter-Day Saints meet for publicworship at Mr J. Barretts Academy 57 King'sSquare Goswell Road (entrance door in President St)every Sabbath at 3 and half past 6 o'clock p.m.: alsoon Tuesday and Thursday Evenings each week at Eighto'clockLectureswill be delivered by Elders Woodruff and Smith(late from America)who respectfully invite the citizens of London to attend.The first principles of the Everlasting Gospelin its fulness. 
 go to America" "Brother Woodruff wont you come and preach in Cheltenham?" "My head is in great pain Wont you healme?" "I want you to consecrate these bottles of oil before you go" "Will you write to me?" "I have been waiting a long while to get a chance to speak to you". "Good by" "Remember me to Mrs Woodruff!" "Good by! God bless you!"Thus was I for more than an hour after the close of the meeting assailled with the affectionate outbursts and adieus and a host of perplexities of these Saints who crowded around me as children to their father. for as such in Christ they were.Many of the Saints parted from me in tears and many followed me to Turkey Hall where I spent the night and they filled the house until a late hour beging counsel and instruction of me. One of these was a Baptist Minister who had just been baptized into the church.On the morrow in company of Elder Needham I walked to Keysend Street where I preached to a crowded congregation of Saints and on the following day I walked to Wind PointOn the way I went into the Giants cave on Malvern Hill. It was dug out of solid rock and its dimensions are six feet by four at the mouth 12 feet in length and seven feet in length. The stone that covered the mouth had rolled down the Hill.After viewing the Giants Cave I^where I^ visited the Saints at Wind's Point and thence continued to Colwall, and ^where I^ met a large congregation of the Saints and preached to them upon the Gathering, which everywhere now formed the burden of my soul to the churches I were bidding farewell. Two of those present Elders James and Henry Jones were like Paul had been great persecutors but were now preaching what they had once persecutedI received a letter from Elder Snow 
 We arrived at 12 o clock aA.mM. and stoped atthe American House.I had only 24 hours to do mybusiness in and after dinner notwithstanding the fever was raging upon me I commenced and boughtmy stock of paper and walked till ten o'clock atnight and went to bed very weary sick and in severepain and did not sleep until 2 o'clockI was awoke with the bleeding ofthe nose. I lost a pint of blood and felt very weakyet I commenced business before breakfast and gotmy goods on board by 2 o'clock in the afternoon.I took dinner and went to bed tired and sick indeedThe boat started at 6 o'clock inthe evening and we arrived at Keokurk having hadover two days and nights of suffering. I had bledat the nose considerable and had the canker whichI killed with tobaco.I left the boat and took stageand arrived at Montrose at the time of a Masonicprocession and the institution of a Lodge in thatplaceI had an interview there with Josephand then crossed to Nauvoo and arrived home thoroughlypickled with the billious feverYet notwithstanding my state Icould not stop to rest for I found that the printingoffice had stood still ten days for want of paperThe boat was five days gettingover the Rapids during which time I went downthe river six miles with a skiff and got fromthe steam boat what paper we needed for present useWe were until midnight rowing over the Rapids andin addition to my fever I caught a severe coldAs soon as the boat had landedour freight at Nauvoo and I had seen it distributedto its several departments I went home and took tomy bed and passed through the severest fit of sickness

There were present aboutfifty persons unto whom I preached and Elder Smith preachedin the evening; but it was the hardest matter to awakenan interest in the subjects that I had ever found.Next day I received a package of seven lettersone from John Taylor from the Isle of Man to H C. Kimballone from Father John Smith one from Elias Smith one from Orson Pratt besides the several others and one from my wifeExtract of the Letter from my WifePhebe.July 18th 1840My Dear Willford,What will be your feelings when I say that yesterday I was called to witness the departureof our little Sarah Emma from this world. Yes sheis gone! The relentless hand of Death has snatched herfrom my embrace. But ha! she was too lovely tookind too affectionate to live in this wicked worldWhen looking upon her I have often thoughthow I should feel to part with her. I thought I could notlive without her especially in the absence of my companionBut she has gone! The Lord hath taken her home tohimself for some wise purpose. It is a trial to mebut the Lord hath stood by me in a wonderful mannerI can see and feel; and that he has taken her home andwill take better care of her than I possibly could for alittle while until I shall go and meet her. 
 who informed me that the work of God was rolling on in London and that he had baptized seven the Sunday previous I also received a letter from Elders Young and ^W.^ Richards.Next day I had an interview with Elder Levi Richards and then with him ^I^ walked over MalvernHill and called upon Elder Samuel Jones; Thence through Great Malvern to Crowcat and held a meeting at brother George Brooks' and had an interesting time with a large number of Saints whom I had baptized about a year beforeTo Dunsclose the day after visiting many of the Saints by the way laying hands upon the sick and blessing and counselling others of the flock. They all were happy to see me for I had baptized most of them when I first opened that field of labour. ^Next day^I preached at Dunsclose at the house of Edward Jinkins to a crowded meeting but a wicked rabble disturbed us much and I was constrained sharply to reprove them in the power of GodA very rainy day was the 20th but accompanied with a guide I journeyed to Rough Leaserand thence to Ridgeway ^Cross^. Here I found Elder Thomas Clarkat his stone quary. I took several specimens of curious petrified stone formed by the water. We then walked to Frooms' Hill and visited the Saints by the waySunday followed and this was the last Sabbath I should meet the Saints in Standly and Froom's Hill.At brother John Coles Frooms Hill,I met the Saints in the ^Sunday^ morning and had a crowded house and in the afternoon at Standly Hill where I communed with the Church. and aAt the close of the meeting I had a busy time shaking hands with the Saints and parting from them many of whom wished me to bless them and others to heal themI spent the night with brother Levi Richards at Elder Edward Ockey and on the morrow we held conference. 
 I ever had in my lifeI had a thorough course of bilious feverand was brought exceedingly low and for a time struggledbetween life and death. Some of the time I felt likegathering up my feet and sleeping with my fathersI was confined to my house and mostlyto my bed from the 10th of August to the 129th of Septembermaking forty days.The Twelve came and anointed meand laid hands upon me and I felt the testimonythat I should recover but after I began to revive I hada relapse twiceIn one instance I was requested to attenda council of the Twelve in the case of Orson Pratt. Iwas very weak but yet I thought I would try to meet withthem and supposed that we should meet at Elder Taylor'swho was also very low with the bilious fever; but on ourarrival we found him so very feeble that he was notable to have the council at his house. So we removedto President Hyrum Smiths OfficeElder Brigham Young conveyed mein his carriage to the place of meeting but I had notbeen in the house more than ten minutes before mystrength began to fail me. I laid down upon a benchbut no sooner was I laid down than I became unconsciousand my breath stoped.My brethren raised me up and took meto the door and with the aid of air and water I was broughtto breath again but not without a hard struggle betweenlife and death.The brethren laid hands upon meand Hyrum Smith prayed for my recovery and I soonbegan to breathe freer but my strength was entirely goneThey conveyed me home and it beingin a warm season I was much troubled for breathingthrough the night. Several days elapsed before Irevived againDuring my sickness there had been 
 Yes Willford we have one little angel in heaven and I thinkit likely her spirit has visited you before this timeIt is hard living without her and sheused to call her "poor pa, pa; and putty Papa manytimes in a day. She left a kiss for her Papa withme just before she died.She eat her dinner just as wellas usual on Thursday was taken ill about 4 o'clockwith prestness for breath. The Elders laid hands uponher and anointed her a number of times; but thenext day her spirit took its flight from this to anotherworld without a groanTo-day little Willford and I with quite a number of friends accompanying us came over toCommerce to pay our last respects to our little darlingin seeing he[r] decently burried. She had no relativesto follow her to the grave or to shed a tear forher but her Ma and little WillfordI have just been to take a pleasingmelancholy walk to Sarah's grave. She lies alone inpeace. I can say "The Lord gave and the Lordhath taken away and blessed be the name of theLord. [##Job 1:21##] Phebe W. Woodruff.On the 20th I finished a longcommunication to the Editors of the Times and Seasonssigned H. C. Kimball W. Woodruff and George A.Smith. It was commenced on the 12th. I copied it offand it filled 4 sheets. We wrote several others to ACordon &c and next day heard from Parley P. Prattand received also a letter from Willard Richards with thepresent of one pound. On the 30th I wrote a longletter to my wife and we were often receiving and writingcommunications to our brethren of the Twelve andthe Elders Saints relatives and friends both in Englandand America. It may well be imagined thatthe numerous letters which we received and wrote fromtime were not only interesting but often important tous and the Church and that they were as much a branch

 some important events in the Church. The Lord hadmanifested through the Prophet Joseph that it was hiswill that the First Presidency the Twelve the High Councilthe quorum of High Priests and the Elders quorumshould as a general thing go into the vineyardThe instructions were for the Eldersto confine themselves to the free States and mostlyto New England and the Canadas and not to gointo any of the Indian or Slave StatesThere had been a special Conference called in consequence and about four hundred Eldershad gone into the Vineyard and many others weregoing. Since the foundation of the Church there hadnever been such a turn out into the ministry beforeas nowBrother Taylor and myself werethe only ones of the Twelve left and we were sickand could not go into the vineyard: moreover itwas thought wisdom for us to continue in theprinting buisness.The Prophet had of late been muchpersecuted by being hunted by Sherifs and officersfrom Missouri and Illinois by the orders of GovernorsReynolds and Carlin under pretence of taking himto Missouri to try him upon their false charge ofhis being accessary to the shooting of Ex-GovernorBoggs. This was nothing but pretence and a trapto take the Prophet upon a charge which caught thespirit of persecution in our enemies and not because therewas any evidence in the case.But though the Prophet Joseph hadbeen of late like John on the Isle of Patmos he hadpresented the Church with some glorious principles andhad occassionally appeared in the midst of the Saintsbut I was deprived of the privilege of being present asI was confined with sicknessSeptember the 19th I commencedwork for the first time for forty days and cut one 
 of our ministerial labours as preaching or baptizing, but I cannot alwasys note the detail of our communications nor wouldthe bare mention give the value of the correspondence of theTwelve one to the other and to the Elders labouring under theirdirection and their communications to the representative men ofthe Church in Nauvoo. Much more than can appear tothe reader who will be told in my synopsis of the year thatin 1840 I wrote 200 letters and received 112 and much morethan would appear if told the amount of correspondence of therest of the Twelve and Elders in the ministry labouring withus much of our letter writing to each other in counselling directing assisting and building each other up belong to thehistory of the rise and progress of the British Mission.Therefore in my Journal I always noted my correspondenceas a branch of my ministerial historyThe dark season of the year November openedupon us and the prospect of our mission in the city ofLondon was in keeping therewith. There is so much going on in this great modern Babylon to draw the attention ofthe people that it seemed almost to require the trumpetsblast from heaven to awaken the attention of the inhabitantsto our proclamation of the restoration of the fulness ofthe GospelWe were here like the Apostles ofold without purse or scrip to warn the city of London,where we had to pay high for everything we required, andto pay ourselves for a place to preach in. We were atthis time about out of money, but still we felt to trustin GodNovember the 14 was Sunday ^Nov 1st^ and Ipreached in the afternoon in the Academy to aboutthirty and in the evening to about 50. We broke breadunto the Saints and this evening there seemed to be someinterest manifested in inquiring into the work.I received a letter from my mother-in-lawcontaining the news of the death of my uncle Joseph Hartand wrote to my father in reply

 acre of corn and staked it up for my first day's work; andthe next two days I spent in drawing wood to my door.I was forced to these exertions as it wereon the first moment of my recovery for I had been sick so longthat we had consumed our food and fuelElders Young and Kimball returned homefor a few days to get some printing and they were going outagain to hold conferences throughout the State. I had aninterview with them and learned that they had met in Councilwith brother Joseph who thought it widom for Elder Taylorand myself to continue at home and attend to the printingThere was at this time a prospect ofthe town of Keokurk coming into the hands of theSaints and Joseph's counsel was for me to go therein that case and publish a political paper and ElderTaylor to publish the Times and Seasons in NauvooSo I managed the affairs of my family to be ready to do as the Lord should direct. However in the sequel I didnot go to Keokurk. In addition to my own sicknessMrs Woodruff had a species of fellen on both herthumbs which had caused her much pain for two orthree weeks and my little daughter had been quite illabout the same length of time and dangerously ill for several daysUnexpectedly the next Sunday Josephappeared in our midst and spoke to the Saints muchto their edification and comfortThree Sundays later I preachedto the congregation and warned the Saints against taking ^not to take^a course against the interest of the Church but to take one which would help Joseph in his exileSome time after this we had a firein the upper part of the printing office. A minutesdelay and we should not have saved the buildingOn the 30th of October for the firsttime the Saints held meeting in the Temple of theLord in Nauvoo. A temporary floor was laidwithin the unfinished walls and seats prepared for 
 After the meeting was dismissed I was about three hours shaking hands with the Saints healing the sick and giving counsel to the multitude who surrounded me many of whom were in tears as we parted. Nearly fifty came to me to ask me to take them to Zion when I had not means to take myself. I however gave Sister Foxal five pounds to make up enough to help her and her husband and children to the land of America. She had raised 30 pounds by using every exertion for six months to gather with the Saints and the five pounds which I gave her was a donation of Elder Edward Ockey who was imparting of his substance to help the poor of the Church to gather.After biding the multitude of Saints farewell I went to Elder Oackey's to spend the night accompanied by Elders Richards Kington and KayWe had been in the house but a short time when ^3 of^ Edward Ockey's brothers camein for the purpose of having a contest because their brother and sister had embraced the gospel and was about to gather with the Saints. They manifested much wrath against me and after conversing with them about 3 hours they left the house and we were once more in peaceAfter conversing together until the third watch of the night we retired to rest closing one of the busiest days of my life.I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep and after conversing several hours with Elders Richards Kington Kay Ockey and others of the SaintsI was under the necessity of parting with the Saints in this region.In biding them farewell I found in our hearts and memory of our association many ties which bound me to those I were leaving behindand among the faithful ones were the Ockeys.Brother Edward Ockey and his sister Ann were of 
 three thousand persons. The room was crowded andthe walls lined with people. Joseph had returnedto the city and was expected to preach but ill-healthand other causes prevented him.On the same day Willard Richardsreturned from the east with his family and thenext day came to my house and was taken withthe Cholera Morbeus and was low for several daysMy son Willford was taken downwith the croup and for a time was dangerousThe Twelve returned home onthe 4th of NovemberJoseph wished Elder John Taylor and myself to take the responsibility ofthe Printing Office and liberate him from itHe offered to rent the property to us for simple interestand we concluded to take itThe City Council spent severaldays in session passing a law relative to Writ ofHabus Corpus and after it was passed Josephfelt secure to stay at home as it protected himas well as other citizens.On the 7th of the following month(December) Elder Orson Hyde returned to Nauvoohaving in his mission been in England GermanyJerusalem and other parts of AsiaIn England Elder Hyde was withthe Twelve when they in the capacity of a quorumfully organized the British Mission; in Germany hepreached and published the Gospel in the Germanlanguage and circulated the tracts among the variousnations and in Jerusalem he visited Mount OlivetHe was the first Elder of the Latter-day Churchwthat ever visited Jerusalem.The following Sunday ElderOrson Hyde at President Joseph Smiths deliveredan interesting an account of his travels at Jerusalemand home again. He spoke of the Mount Olivit 
 work in London. I wrote to Elders Kington and Browettof my Herefordshire field and a very lengthy one to my wife'sfather and mother giving an account of this country.This was the Lord Mayor's day whenthe chief Magestrate of the chief city of the world takes the oathof office. It is a great day in London. I saw thegorgeous procession pass.^In letter^ This day Elder Richards informedme that it was the counsel of the Twelve for him ^G A Smith^ to goimmediately to the Potteries and spend some time withthe churches there as there was only about work enoughfor one in London and so early next morning he started for Birmingham and I was left again aloneThe next few days I felt lonelywithout my companion brother Smith for although Londonis not a wilderness a Latter-day Saint Travelling Elderat that date would be almost as solitary there.At night on the 12th while I waspreaching Brother Wm Pitt from Dymock entered theroom I was surprised to see him for I was notlooking for any ^one^. He became a companion in theministry for me during the next five daysOn the 16th I received a letter fromElder Thomas Clark containing a gift of  1 andone from Elder Browett informing me of the progressof the work in Herefordshire and surroundingcountry. I wrote to them and Elder Kingtonand held several hours conversation with afollower of Joanna Southcott and several daysafter had a long interview with five of herfollowers. In the meantime Elder Pitt hadleft me and took a mission to Ipswich. andI had preached several times and as usual receivingand writing letters daily.On the 19th I preached at theAcademy. Brother Hulme a captain of one ofthe Pickford's Boats on the London canal waspresent with two of his hands whom he had baptized. 
 a good and wealthy family. and They had many trials to pass through to do the will of God and maintain their faith and integrity  and to gather with the Saints for their brothers were exceedingly set against them. But brother Edward had maintained his integrity like a man of God and was making every preparation to gather with the Saints but his sister Ann had fears that her brothers would hinder her gathering.Having bid farewell to the Saints of Standly Hill I walked to Frooms Hill and conversed with the Elders untl 2 o'clock when I took the parting hands of Elders Richards Kington Kay and others and with my carpet-bag with about 20 lbs weight in it walked 15 miles to Worcester in four hoursWhen I arrived there I was so very lame and weary with my heavy load and fast walking that I could scarcely walk at all. I then took the rail and arrived in Birmingham at 10 o'clock at night but was exceedingly lame and weary. I spent the night with Elder James Riley 24 Park Street.I had now fairly ended my Herefordshiremission and bidden a last farewell to that field of labour where the Lord had blessed me beyond all my expectationsI now left three conferences in the region which I opened one year before on the 5th of the same month that I left this vineyard planted all over with Churchesnumbering fifteen hundred Saints. I have given the minutes of those Conference not to load my book with dry statestics which is never interesting to the reader but to lay at once before the view if I may so express it diagrams of the rise and progress of the work number of Churches planted and conferences organized in that region.

Joseph had been presecutedhunted and driven into the wilderness in consequenceof illegal proceedings false oaths edicts of governors andpursuit from SheriffsBut the^re^ being now a new GovernorJoseph had come forward and given himself upto the authorities of the State and demanded trialThis was the very thing which he would have beendenied before had Governors Reynolds and Carlingot possession of him and taken him to Missouri 
 modeler whose wife was the daughter of Brother Roberts ^Rogers^ and she was an AmericanVisit to the Tower of LondonIn company of Brothers Brigham Young and HeberC Kimball on the 3rd of December I visited the Towerof London without seeing which the traveller would lose a capital page from the history of his travels in England.As usual I called at the time and entered in myJournal a synopsis of its history &cThe Tower is situated on the east sideof the city about 800 yards from London Bridge and nearthe bank of the Thames. At first it consisted ofno more than what at present is called the White TowerIt has been said though without sufficient authority thatJulius Caesar built it but there is the strongest of evidencethat William the Conquerer was its first designer andbuilder. It has three batteries The Devils Batterythe Stone Battery and the Wooden Battery all mountedwith cannon.The Tower was a palace during fivehundred years but ceased to be so in the time ofElizabeth and here some of the darkest tragedies ofof England's monarchs were enacted and immortalizedby Shakespear's pen. The principal buildings arethe Church the White Tower Govenor's House The BloodyTower the offices of ordinance of the Keepers of theRecords the Jewel Office the Horse Armoury QueenElizabeths armoury the grand Store House in whichis the small armoury the train of Artillery andthe Tent Room the new Store House houses forthe chief and inferior officers mess house for theofficers and barracks for the soldiers. In additionto these there is a street called the Mint whichincludes one third part of the TowerThe Grand Storehouse is north of theWhite Tower. It extends in length 345 feet 
 of silk for my wife as cheep as could be bought in EnglandThence to Hanley with several of the brethren and sat in council with a number of the officers Among other business was the case of a brother Mumford who was practising the black art fortune telling &c but as he persisted in his course the council withdrew fellowship from him. One thing is worthy of notice that while the Priesthood was upon him he could not set his magic glassesas before but did after the office of Priest was taken from himI spent the night at Brother ^William^ Box who had been sorely tempted and afflicted of the Devil for many days We laid our hands upon him and cast the devil out and he had peace.On Sunday the 20th of March theStaffordshire Conferenceof the Church of Latter-day Saints met and there were present of the Twelve George A. Smith and WillfordWoodruff with one High Priest 13 Elders 28 Priests 10 Teachers and eight Deacons. The conference was held in the Majestrates Assembly Room.At the close of the Conference it was voted that "This conference grants unto Elders Woodruff and George A. Smith a letter of recomemendation manifesting that the Church in this region accept of their labours and consider that they have filled their mission with honour and dignity"We had a very interesting timeon this occassion. The conference was held in a place which would hold 800 and it was crowded; but therewas perfect order and much good feeling manifestedduring the day. There was a good prospect of a continued increase in the PotteriesGeorge A. Smith was the President of the Conference and T. J. Fitcher and O Shaw clerksNext day George A Smith and myself met the officers in council at the Hanley ^Meeting^ Room and gave 
 Too well our history had told us how Joseph and his brethrenhad been incarcerated in prison where they had laid in somecases the year round inhumanly treated and their lives inconstant jeopardy and all in contempt of law and withouttrial. This was the reason why Joseph wished not tobe delivered up to the tender mercy of Missouri.But the election of a new Governor hadgiven the Prophet a chance of a trial and he returned anddemanded one and delivered himself to the authorities ofthe State of IllionoisThe demanded trial was grantedhim before the Supreme Court of the United States andhe had been honourably acquitted according to the lawof the law of  ^land^ as he well knew he would be if granteda legal trial and not committed to the lawless powerof those in authority who sought his liberty and hislife.Joseph had now returned to Nauvooto have a Jubilee with the ChurchThe seventeenth of January wasappointed by General Proclamation for humiliationfasting prayer and thanksgiving for the releaseand delivery which we had receivedMeetings were appointed throughoutthe city. I met at President Joseph Smiths wherewe had a very interesting timeBrother Joseph spoke for somelength on the Kingdom of God and the baptism ofJohn and other subjects of interest the substance ofwhich was aftwards delivered by the Prophet in theTemple and which I shall presently give.At our meeting on this GeneralThankgiving day besides the address of the Prophetmany prayers and exhortations were made. I spoke twiceand felt much of the Spirit of the presentThe next day Joseph and hislady made a feast for his friends to keep theday as a time of rejoicing for his deliverance

 of God was set up on the earth from the days of AdamWhen ever there has been a righteous man unto whom theLord has revealed his word and given power and authorityto administer in his name then has the Kingdom ofGod been set up and where there is a Priest of the MostHigh a minister who has power and authority fromHim to administer in the ordinances of the Gospeland officiate in the Priesthood there is the Kingdomof God.In consequence of rejecting the Gospelof Jesus Christ and the Prophets whom God hathsent His judgements hath rested upon people citiesand nations in various ages of the world. This wasthe case with the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah whichwere destroyed for rejecting the ProphetsNow I will give my testimony. Icare not for man. I speak boldly and faithfullyand with authority.How is it with the Kingdomof God? Where did the Kingdom of God begin?What constitutes the Kingdom of God?I answer where there is no Kingdomof God there is no salvation. Where there is a Prophet or a Priest or a righteous man unto whom the Lord giveshis oracles there is the kingdom and where the oraclesare not there the Kingdom of God is notIn these remarks I have no allusionto the Kingdoms of the earth. We will keep the laws ofthe land. We do not speak against them nor ever havebut we can scarcely make mention of the State of Missouriand our persecutions but the cry goes forth that weare guilty of treason &cWe speak of the Kingdom of Godon the earth and not the kingdoms of menThe plea of many is that we haveno right to receive revelations; but if we do not receiverevelation we do not have the oracles of God and theywho have not the oracles of God are not His people

 "But say you, what will become of the worldor the various professors of religion who do not beleivein revelation and the oracles of God as continued to HisChurch in all ages of the world when He has hada people upon the earth?"I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ they will be damned and when you get intothe eternal world you will find it to be so. Theycannot escape the damnation of hell."The Baptism of JohnAs touching the Gospel and Baptism of ^which^ Johnpreached I would say John came preaching theGospel for the remission of sins. He had hisauthority from God and the ^His^ oracles of God werewith him and the Kingdom for a season seemedto rest with John alone.The Lord promised Zechariahthat he should have a son and Zechariah wasa descendant of Aaron. And the Lord hadpromised that the Priesthood should continue withAaron and his seed throughout their generations"'Let no man take this honourupon himself except he be called of God as wasAaron' and Aaron received his call by revelation"An angel of God also appeared untoZachariah while in the Temple and said that he should have a son whose name should beJohn and be should be gifted with the Holy Ghost" [##Luke 1:13-15##]Zachariah was a Priest of the Lordand officiated in the Temple and John was a Priestafter the order of his father and held the Keys ofthe Aaronic Priesthood and was called of God topreach the Gospel of His ^and the^ Kingdom ^of God^.

 "But, it may be said, the Kingdom of Godcould not be set up in the days of John for he saidthe Kingdom was at hand. But I would ask couldit be any nearer than in the hands of John? Thepeople needed not wait for the day of Pentecostto find the Kingdom of God for John had it withhim and he came forth from the wilderness crying'Repent ye for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand' [##Matthew 3:2##]as much as to cry out 'Here I have the Kingdomof God and you can obtain it. I am comingafter you and if you do not receive it you willbe damned. And the scriptures representthat all Jerusalem went out unto John and werebaptized of him. [##Matthew 3:5-6##]"Here was a legal administrator.Those who were baptized were subjects for theKing and the laws and oracles of God were thereTherefore the Kingdom of God was there"No man could have betterauthority to administer than John and evenour Saviour submitted to that authority himselfby being baptized of John. [##Matthew 3:13##] Therefore theKingdom of God was set up upon the earth evenin the days of JohnThere is a difference betweenthe Kingdom of God and the fruit and blessingswhich flow from that Kingdom. Because therewere more miracles gifts visions healings tongues &cin the days of Jesus Christ and his Apostles& on the day of Pentecost than under John's administration it does not prove by any meansthat he had not the Kingdom of God. It does notprove this any more than it would that a womanhad not a milk pan because she had not a pan ofmilk; for while the pan might be compared tothe Kingdom the milk might be likened to the blessings of the Kingdom.John was a Priest after the order of

The report wasuntrueSunday was an interesting day to us Elders Young Kimball and Priest Williamsattended meeting at St Pauls in the morning andI met with the Saints at Father Corners and readand conversed with them and in the afternoon metat the Academy and had about 50 present Brother Kimballpreached to themAn Independent Minister invitedme home to take tea with him. I accepted hisinvitation had an interesting time and preached theGospel to him and he received my testimony and offeredme his chapel which would hold 800. He said hethought he should be baptized and would try andget his society to do the sameWe met again in the eveningand had more at our meeting than ever before. BrotherBrigham Young preached and was followed by brothersKimball Williams Corner Hulme and myselfWe had a very interesting timeand one offered himself for baptism. There were someof the Aikenites present one of whom purchased aHymn Book. They wished us to call upon themand thought they would be baptized. We then metat Father Corner's and communed with the Saints andhad a good time. 
 The Conference reassembled pursuant to adjournment and opened by prayer.The scattered members were represented consisting of nearly 50 members not included in the foregoingThe President then made some remarks on the office of Patriarch and concluded by moving that Elder John Albertson be ordained to that office. This was seconded by Elder Kimball and carried unanimouslyResolved that G. D. Watt G. J. Adams Amos Fielding WilliamKay John Sanders J. Riley Thomas RichardsonJames Whitehead Thomas Dunville James Galley ^&^ George Simpson be ordained High Priests.Resolved that the following persons be ordained Elders:William Miller William Leach, John Sandy William Moon William Hardman, Wm Black John Goodfellow Joseph Brotherton, Richard Benson Theophilus Brotherton John Mc Ilwrickand William Green.The Council of the Twelve then proceeded to organize all the Churches into Conferences throughout the Kingdom of Great Britain, and appoint presiding Elders over them.The Conference then adjourned till 7 o'clockwhen it re-assembled and opened by singing and prayerThe Patriarch Peter Mellen was then called upon to pronounces the Patriarchal blessing and ^upon^ the head of John Albertson previous to his being ordained to the office of Patriarch. He then laid his hands upon him and blessed himThe Twelve afterwards laid their hands upon him and ordained him to the office of Patriarch.The High Priests and Elders were then ordained and much counsel was given by the President and others of the TwelveA very richly ornamented cake a present 
 Aaron and had the keys of that Priesthood and cameforth preaching repentance and baptism for the remissionof sins but at the same time crying 'There comethone after me mightier than I the latchet of whoseshoes I am not worthy to unloose [##Luke 3:16##]And Christ came according to theword of John. He was greater than John becausehe held the keys of the Melchisidic priesthoodand Kingdom of God and had before revealedthe Priesthood to Moses; and Jesus in histeachings says upon this rock I will build my churchand the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. [##Matthew 16:18##]What Rock? Revelation!Yet Christ was baptized by Johnto fulfill all righteousness. "Again He says exceptye are born of water and the Spirit ye cannotenter the Kingdom of Heaven"; [##John 3:5##] and though theheavens and the earth pass away my word shallnot pass away"If a man be born of the waterand the Spirit he can enter into the Kingdom ofGod.It is evident that the Kingdom ofGod was upon the earth and John prepared subjectsfor that Kingdom by preaching the Gospel to themand baptizing them. He prepared the waybefore the Saviour or came as a forerunner andprepared for the preaching of ChristChrist preached through Jerusalemon the same ground where John had preached andwhen the Apostles were raised up they ^also^ worked inJerusalem and Jesus commanded them to tarry thereuntil they were endowed with power from on high [##Luke 24:49##]Had they not work to do inJerusalem? They did work and prepared peoplefor the Pentecost; but the Kingdom of God waswith them before the day of Pentecost as well asafterwards. 
 I rejoiced at the prospect which was opening beforeus for we had laboured a long time and the work hadgone slow but now a wide opening was being made toroll on the work of the Lord in the Metroplis of EnglandBut, though slow the work in Londonin its early history, and with us in calling the people intothe Kingdom of God like as with the servants of theKing in the parable, whose invitation to the MarriageFeast was met, every man with his excuse yet the Lordhad been with us, and the prophetic spirit was abundantwith testimonies of our mission. Doubtless this propheticview of the future made our missionary labours inthe great Babylon of modern times less wearisomethan it otherwise would have been. The Spirit allalong bore testimony to us that there would be a greatwork done in London and Elder Kimball prophesiedthat there would the greatest numbers and the largestconference. This has since been abundantly fulfilledfor London has become the metropolis of the foreignmissions of the ChurchOn the seventh of the month weall acompanied Dr Copeland to the college of Surgeonsand next visited the National Gallery and otherparts of the city and then returned and took tea afterwhich Elder Kimball baptized one at the Bathin Taberancle Square. Brothers Young Williamsand myself walked into another part of the townand had a view of "Life in London."A Visit to the Stables of the QueenIt was a rainy day in London but wehad all concluded to visit St James' Park BuckinghamPalace and the Queens stables.

 day. Brother Kimball and myself and two of theSaints started walked to St James Park and through thewhole length of it and visited the Palace and the Queen'sStables.The first stable we entered was thatof the State Horses. They were 12 in number andthe most beautiful cream coloured Hanovarians. Theywere the most kind and intelligent of anything of thebrute creation I ever saw and were about seventeenhands high and well proportioned. We also saw twelveArabians and we visited all the stables containing herMajesty's horses which were one hundred and fiftyin numberWe next viewed the appartmentscontaining the harness for 150 horses. There wasthe full set of state harness, for eight cream colouredHanavarians, made by order of George IV and wascovered with gold plate and the harness of each horseweighed 150 lbs. Every set was very expensive beingcovered with gold plateA birds eye view of the Queensriding ground we took as we passed along and sawone of the Lords and others of the Household ridingout. Entering the coach houses we saw her Majestysprivate coaches a number of which were very grandand costly and lastly came our inspection of the State Coach.DescriptionofHer Majesty's State CoachIt was finished in the year 1762, is the most superbcarriage ever built was designed by Sir William Chambersand built under his direction.

Pratt have since departed to fill their calling in another sphere. They therefore in this life can never meet and act again as on that dayFuture Generation deeply interested in the capital items of the history of this Church will doubtless deem it worthy of marked record and of great historical importance to find authoritative data that the First Apostles of the Church ordained under the presidentcy of the Prophet Joseph never sat as a full council nor legislated in their quorum capacity only in America and England and in this only time in Foreign Missions Brigham Young sat at their head and then they organized the British Mission prior to the return of seven of their number to America and from that British Mission has branched out the foreign missions of the Church throughout Europe.On the day after the Conference I called at the book store of Elder Parley P.

It was descovered at 7 o'clockand gradually disappeared from half past sevenand at nine o'clock it was entirely gone.This sign of a drawn swordin the heavens appeared for several eveningsand on the 14th it moved up near the moon andformed itself into a large ring around the moonballs immediately appeared in the ring oppositeeach other something in the form of sundogsand another half ring issued from those ballssomething in the shape of a horseshoe extendingoutside of the first ring with one line runningthrough the centre of the moonProphetic Declaration of JosephuponThe Sign of the Sword in the Heavens"As sure as there is a God who sitsin the heavens and as sure as He ever spoke byme so sure will there be a speedy and bloodywar and the broad sword seen last ^night^ is thesign thereof."A week or two afterwards there werealso remarkable signs in the heavens.

Pratt and was confirmed. We dined at his house after which we all walked to the Zoollogical Gardins. There were fifteen of the American brethren present. We returned and took tea at Bro Mc KendricksNext day I accompanied Elder Taylor to the railway station and he took his departure for Liverpool.On the Sunday I preached in the Carpenters Hall in the morning and was followed by Parley P. Pratt and in the afternoon the sacrament was administered and amny testified of the work In the evening Elder O. Pratt preached from ##Daniel## upon the Kingdoms symbolised in that book and Elders Kimball and Young followed him.I spent the 14th counting out the Millennial Star and had 76 volumes as my share of the property and I had sold 40 Hymn Books to P. Pratt a few days previous 
 on the morning of March the 23rdThere were also other signs and it was singularthat in the case of the sign of the sword that on the oppositeside of the horison there was seen a black streak about the sizeand shape of the light one. The one was black as darknesswhile the other had considerable the appearence of the blaze of a comet.On the 12th of April the Steam boatAmaram arrived at Nauvoo with 230 Saints from Englandled by Lorenzo SnowThe next day the Steam boat Maid ofIowa arrived with 250 Saints who had been in St Louisduring the Winter.

 Next day we bid adieu to Manchester We left Elder Parley P. Pratt and family in good health and spirits. We left him with a store of Books of Mormon Hymn Book Voice of Warning Poems Tracts and Stars for sale.Elders Young O Pratt myself G. A. Smith and Levi Richards took train to Liverpool and brother G. A. Smith and myself took up our abode at Bro Haringtons near Scotland RoadWe arrived just in time to attend a splendid tea meeting of the Saints at the Music Hall Liverpool. This Hall the Church had rented for the Latter day Saints meeting place and it would hold about 2000. There was ^were^ now sat down to table at this tea meeting about 200 SaintsThis was the first time I had visited Liverpool since I first landed. It gave me peculiar feelings to set down to the festive board with 200 Saints and to think that when we first landed there was not a soul in that great place who belonged to the Church but ourselvesAfter tea we were introduced to this intelligent body of Saints and the Twelve addressed them in a few words.After the meeting our quorum met for a few minutes and concluded to sail on the following ThursdayThe next day was an exceedingly busy day for the Saints were coming in from the various parts of England to sail for New York on board the ship Rochester with us among whom was brother Ockey and family and brother Fidoe and family from HerefordshireWith Elder John Taylor I visited the agents of the ship on which we were going and we detained the ship one day on our accountThis company was disposed to do all they could to favour us for it was to their interest

They embalmed his body and tookit to the land of Canaan and buried it with his fathers [##Genesis 50:25-26##] [##Exodus 13:19##]There is a glory in this whichmany do not comprehend. It is true that in theresurrection the Saints will be caught up to meetthe Lord and they will all be brought together thoughtheir bodies were scattered upon the face of the wholeearth. Yet they could not as readily saluteeach other as though ^they^ had laid down and rose uptogether from the same bed.To bring it to the understandingit would be as though two who were very dear friendsindeed should lie down upon the same bed at nightlocked in each others embrace talking of their love andin the morning awaking together they could immediatelyrenew their conversation ^even^ while rising from their bedBut if they were alone and in seperate appartments theycould not as readily salute each other as though they were togetherHe remarked that Shouldhe ^I^ live and have an opportunity of gathering his ^my^friends together who had^ve^ died he ^I^ intended to do sobut should he ^I^ not live to do it him^my^self he ^I^ hoped that 
 by the horses harness and coaches and above are the familiesof the coachmen grooms and those connected with the MewsMr James West her Majestys state coachmaninvited us to dine with him and we did so. We sawall of his State dresses which were richly trimmed andornamented with gold. One coat was exceedingly heavyin consequene of the weight of gold trimmings. When weleft him he made us a present of three small ornamentsfor Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball and WillfordWoodruff. They were made of fine polished brassabout 4 inches in circumference with a lion in the centreand a crown upon the top. They were worn as ornamentsupon the Queen's State Coach. While at the Mewswe were allowed the privilege of being weighed in thescales in which Prince Albert was weighed. ElderKimballs weight was 160 mine was 142 whichwas 2 pounds more than I had ever weighed beforeThe State coachman informed me that her Majesty would be quite familiar andeven sociable in some respects with some of her subjectsbut was kept distant by her MinistryFrom the Royal Mews we walkedto the National Gallery and having viewed thepaintings we returned home somewhat weary forwe had walked ten miles in a rainy dayNext day we had a long and pleasantdays walk in accompanying brother Brigham Youngin his visit to St Paul's and other noted places.From the body of the cathedralwe ascended to the Whispering Gallery thence to theGolden Gallery and then to the Ball where we allthree sat together 400 feet from the ground.Descending we visited the Librarythe Bell the Clock and finally every part of thebuilding and lastly the Crypt among all the toombsIt cost 7/6 each to visit every part of the cathedralFrom St Pauls to the Monumentto its top and descending thence to London Bridge 
 as we had already given them many passengers and the probability was that we should give them many more.They gave us and all our company the second deck ^cabin^ and for our quorum they fitted up a seperate room at half priceThus there was a great difference between the circumstances of our landing in Liverpool on the 11th of January 14840 as strangers in a strange land and penniless and that of our setting sail on the 20th of May ^April^ 1841 with a ship load of Saints and influence sufficient to detain the sailing of the vessel at our will.Truly the Lord had blessed us in adegree unlooked for. Indeed it was a miracle what the Lord had wrought by our hands since our arrival a little over a year before and I was filled with amazemient as I looked back for during that time we had established churches in nearly all the principal towns and cities in England baptized more than 5000 souls published 5000 Books of Mormon 3000 Hymn Books 2500 vols of theMillennial Star and about 50,000 tracts besides gathering to America 1000 members of the Church and establishing ^a great influence^ among the shiping companies of Liverpool which in a few years after had grown to such importanceas to become quite a ruling power not only in Liverpool but in England generally. Indeed to such proportions did the emigration power and notoriety of the Church grow that in its history our emigration agent has been summoned before a committee of the House of Commons upon emigration policy and the company of the Great Eastern Steam Ship has sought of our people to charter their Leviathan of the SeaI spent the following day in running to and fro through the city assisting the Saints. I walked four miles in the evening on the sea shore with a company of Saints and baptized two persons one was Sister Elizabeth Ockey. Her sister Ann accompanied her to the water and they both much desired to sail with us to America with their brother Edward, but 
 some of his [blank] would ^will^He ^I^ wished all the Saints to be comfortedwith the victory they wereill to gain by the resurrection.It is sufficient to encourage the Saint to overcome inthe midst of every trial trouble and tribulation. Thoughthunders roar and earthquakes bellow, lightnings flashand wars be on every hand yet suffer not a joint to tremblenor let your heart faint for the great Elohiem willdeliver you; and if not before, the resurrection willset you eternally free from all those things andfrom pain sorrow and death.I have laboured hard and soughtevery way to try to prepare this people to comprehendthe things which God is unfolding to meIn speaking of the resurrectionI would say that God hath s^h^own unto me avision of the resurrection of the dead; and I sawthe graves open and the Saints as they arose tookeach other by the hand even before they got upor while getting up and great joy and glory restedupon them. 
 which we crossed and continued to the SouthwarkSuspension Bridge which we walked under viewedand then crossed it. The Bridge is forty five rodsin length. We then dined in the city andafterwards took a cab and rode to the Museumand went through every appartment of it. Thisended the day and we returned to our lodgingsin a cab very weary and somewhat ^foot^sore forwe had walked twelve miles and ascendedand descended twelve hundred steps. Howeverwe enjoyed a good night's restOn the morrow we walked overBlackfriars and called at Zion's chapel to attenda sacrament meeting of Mr Aitken's society but they knowing who we were would not let us in forthey feared lest we should break up their societyby the power of our missionThus turned away we crossed homeand held meeting in the evening when I preached andElders Young and Kimball bore strong testimonyto the people.Next day Brother Brigham leftLondon for Cheltenham and I visited Mr JamesAlbon a minister of the Independent order who withhis household beleived our doctrine and on the Sundaywe found more than ever an interest being awakenedin London, and our prayer meeting the next eveningwas attended by the Reverend James Albon who receivedour testimony. We walked home with him andfound his household growing in the faith and readyfor the work of the Lord.Two days after in the evening webaptized four two of whom were Mr and Mrs Morganwith whom we lodged and their apprentice ^Christopher Smith^ and HenryCorner Junr 
 they were not ready. I retired to bed at midnight very weary with my day's labourNext day seven of the Twelve and 120 Saints with them got our baggage on board to set sail but the wind being contrary we staid on shore. This was an exceedingly busy day in settling my business and preparing for my voyage homewardsAmong other matters I received thefollowing Books of Mormon: 12 Morocca 9 shillings each; 25 Gilt Edge 7 shillings; 89 marble edge six and six pence; 35 sheep 5 shillings each. Total value fifty one pounds sixteen shillings and six pence. Of these I made the following distributions; To Ezra Carter and family, 9 Morocca lettered; My father and family 5 Morocca lettered; Willard Richards 2 gilt edge 6 marble edge & 4 sheep skin bound; George A Smith 4 marble edge and 2 sheep skin; and to others of the Saints I made similar presents of Books of Mormon in all to the number of 42.The sisters Elizabeth and AnnOckey made me a presrent of a nice neck-scarf silk handkerchief and gold pin and their brother Edwardpresented me with a purse of 50 sovereigns. Truly this was liberality not often met; and as some of my brethren were more needy than myself I devided a portion of his generous gift with my companions; to Brigham Young  5; Willard Richards  5; and George A Smith  5. I said Truly the Lord hasd been good to us all oIn this mission and had given us all that we needed.I took tea with borther Edward Ockey and sisters on my last evening on shore and oin the morning went on board the Rochester with Brigham Young Heber C Kimball O^rson^ Pratt George A. Smith Willard Richards John Taylor and R. Hedlock. We bade farewell to Parley P. Pratt Orson Hyde and a multitude of the Saints who stood upon the quay to see us start and then the ship drew out 
 On the 19th of the month in Conference withthe Twelve Joseph counciled us to take our missionto the east to obtain means to build the Temple andNauvoo House as we were appointed by the GeneralConference on the 6th of April. At that aniversaryof the rise of the Church The following persons were namedof the quorum of the Twelve for this mission to holdConferences in the east obtain means &c:Brigham Young Heber C KimballOrson Hyde Orson Pratt William Smith WillfordWoodruff and George A Smith.

 The afternoon On ^of^ the following day Dr Copeland spent thewith us and he received our testimony and in the eveningwe preached at our meeting place.I had visited the Rev. James Albonseveral times and given him an account of the riseand progress of the Church of Christ of Latter-daySaints. He beleived in our mission and offeredme his chapel to preach in which would seat abouttwo thousand.Sunday morning we accompaniedour reverend friend and convert to his chapel and wereintroduced to the Commttee one of whom was a preacherwho had travelled much in Russia and other parts ofthe world. At the close of the meeting the Rev. JamesAlbion gave out an appointment for us to preachon the next Sabbath eveningIn the afternoon we met withthe Saints confirmed four and had a full houseand in the evening we preached again and a goodfeeling prevailedAfter meeting the Rev James Alboncalled upon us at our room and told us that hehad given out our appointment to preach in hischapel and had informed his congregation that hewas a Latter-day Saint and should be baptizedand join our Church and that they need no longerconsider him a member of their body unless theywith him joined the Saints. He told usthis made a division among the Committee:some were for going with him and some againstfollowing their pastor into the true fold whichhe had foundThe afternoon of the Mondaywas spent with Dr Copeland with whom we wentto the "Concerts d'Hiver" and heard a fine performanceof a magnificient band of about 100 mostly Germanand French conducted by Mr Ellason. It wasa musical treat. 
 into the river Mercy and cast anchor. This was on the 20th of AprilNext day Wednesday the 21st the wind being favourable we weighed anchor at 12 o'clock and started on our voyage, and had a good breze^eze^ through^out^ the day but most of the passengers were sea sickThe Rochester was a fast sailing vessel of about 1000 tons and there was on board 1020 Saints including seven of the Twelve; 160 not of our people and the ships company making in all 307 souls.On the seventh day of our voyage we had all the pleasure with a touch or two of the disasters ofA Storm at Sea.In the morning we found strong head winds which soon increased to a powerful storm and the scene which followed was full of grandeur and considerable discomfiture to our company.The sails were taken in as soon as possible and it took 16 men to close reef the main topsailThe tempest in its rage was now all powerful & the sea piled up into mountains. Ever and anon our ship was thrown up on the crest of one of those ocean mountains and then pitched into the valeleybeneath rocking tremendously and occassionly shiping seasIn the midst of this was a cry for help was heard in our cabin. I rushed to the scene from whence the cry came and found the ropes giving way which held the luggage piled up between decks Had this broken loose one surge would have hurlled heavy trunks barrels &c into the births [berths] of the men woman and children which would have endangered the lives of many. On seeing the foundation of this mass give way Willard Richards and myself sprang to the place of danger and braced 
 a discourse of which I noted the following:Gems ^Items^ofA Discourse by Joseph"It is not wisdom that we should have all knowledgepresented at once before us but that we should havea little at a time. Then we can comprehend it"-[The speaker then read the Second Epistleof Peter 1st ch. from the 16th to the last verse anddwelt upon the 19th verse. Among other remarksupon the words of the Apostle, "Add to your faithknowledge" &c [##2 Peter 1:5##] the Prophet said]-"The principle of knowledge is the principleof salvation. This doctrine can be comprehended for anyone who cannot obtain ^will receive^ knowledge to be saved will bedamnedThe principle of salvation is given tous through the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Salvationis nothing more nor less than to triumph over all ourenemies and put them under our feet in this worldand a knowledge to triumph over all evil spirits inthe world to come: Then we are saved; as in thecase of Jesus Christ. He was to reign until hehad put all enemies under his feet and the last enemywas deathPerhaps there is a principle herethat few men have thought of. No person can havethis salvation except through a tabernacleNow in this world mankind arenaturaly selfish and ambitious and striving to excelone above another yet some are willing to build up others as well as themselvesSo in the other world there is a varietyof spirits some of whom seek to excel.

 I sat two hours and half for myportrait on the Wednesday and had an interesting chatwith the artist Mr Pistrucci an Italian, in the midstof which brother Kimball called for me and I tooka walk with him and Dr Copeland and his wifeover Blackfriars Bridge.On our return home we lostbrother Kimball and sister Copeland in the crowdand in looking for them I lost the Doctor &brother Kimball sister Copeland so that there wereno two of the four together. After awhile howeverwe all luckily met at Covent Garden and sawthe wonderful performance of Shakspears NightDream and Madam Vestris the celebrated actressand popular favouriteChristmas Eve Brother Kimballand myself went into the streets to see the busymultitude returned to our room and took supper inkeeping with the season retired to bed and dreamedof falling among thievesChristmas Day in LondonChristmas is the greatest day of the year in Englandand this was the first Christmas day I ever spent in a foreign land.In the morning the church bells throughoutLondon chanted for meeting and the Saints also met forservice.

 ourselves against the barrels and held them for a  few moments until they were secured. I then went on the deck to the Captain and informed him of the situation of things below and he sent the sailors with some ropes and they secured the pile.Afterwards I again went to the aftquarter deck to behold the raging of the tempest and the wonders of the deep and the riding of our bark on the mountain billows. It was the grandest scenery I ever beheld upon the seaElders Young Kimball Richardsand Smith was ^were^ with me on deck for a time but all had now gone below with the exception of Elder Willard Richards myself the captain and crewWe were shipping heavy seas. It was now past sunset and I stood in the middle of the aft quarter deck holding the captain's speakingtrumpet it one hand and to a fast bench with the other when we shipped a tremendious sea on the windward side of us which passed clear over thequarter deck upon which I stood. On seeing that we could not escape it Elder Richards threw himself under the shelter of the bulwarks, and the body of the wave went clear over him without wetting him more than a little but as I could not take the same advantage I threw myself upon the deck and held fast to the seat until the sea passed over me and left me drenched with the surge. I now though[t] it time to leave my seat of observations for the day. So I went below and went to bed for I was thoroughly wet.I did not sleep however but little for the ship rocked at a dreadful rate; boxes barrels and tins were tumbling from one end of the cabin to the other and in the steerage about fifteen births were thrown down. 9 at one surge with men woman and children flung into a heap.

 the case with the Devil. When he fell he sought forthings which were unlawful. Hence he was castdown and it is said that he drew away manywith him and the greatness of his punishmentis that he shall not have a tabernacle. Thisis his punishment.So the Devil thinking to thwartthe decree of God goeth up and down the earthseeking whom he may destroy. Any personwhom he can find who will yeild to him hewill find and take possession of the body and reignthere glorifying mightily forgeting that he has astolen body.

 The Sunday following in the evening we preachedby the appointment of its minister in the Indipendant chapel tothe largest congregation we had discoursed before, in London.There were present priests and people of many denominations. Iaddressed them for about the space of one hour. A WesleyanMinister arose and opposed me which had a good effectfor the congregation seeing the spirit he was of turnedagainst him and the Committee refused him the permissionto speak there any more. I was much bound by theopposing spirit still the conduct of ^the^ enemy gave us friendsThe next evening we attended whatwas said to have been the largest Temperance meetingever held in London and the next two days brought usto theClose of the Year.Synopsisofthe Travels and Labours of Willford Woodruffin 1840Places Visited or Laboured in:Liverpool Preston Manchester New Castle, TunstellBurslem Hanley Stoke, & Longton StaffordWolverhampton Birmingham WorcesterHereford Ledbury Malvern HillGloucester Cheltenham OxfordLondonMiles Travelled:4469Meetings Held by me 230;& Places established for Preaching 53,I planted Churches to the number of 47and jointly organized them. 
 were however no lives lost or bones broken. This was the eighth ^seventh^ day in succession that we had strong head windsNext day we had fair wind for the first time and the sun shined pleasantly but the sea was very rough from the galeOne day near this date I was requested toby the brethren to carry the dishes to the cooks galley So I got my hands full of dishes of various kinds andjust as I had reached the door of the galley the ship gave a tremendious lunge so that she was thrown on her beam-ends with her stud sails in the water. This unexpected pitch of the ship plunged me head foremostabout ten feet the whole length of the galley against its side with the cook upon meThis was my first introduction to the cook since I had been to sea. I beged his pardon for such an abrupt enterance and withdrew leaving the cook with three smashed fingers (caused by trying to save me in the fall) to pick up my dishes at leasure which were scattered from one end of his galley to the other. I had no desire for a long time to come to pay the cook a similar visitPassing over the remaining incidents of a voyage accross the Atlantic in an emigrant ship we landed in New York on the 20th of MayNext day George A. Smith and myself took up our abode with Elder L. R. Fosterwho was glad to see us and made us welcomeand brothers Young Kimball and Orson Pratttook up lodgings at the house of Elder G. J.

Then havingthis promise sealed unto them it was as an anchor totheir soul sure and steadfast. Though the thundersmight roll & lightenings flash, earthquakes bellow and wargather thick around yet this knowledge would support thesoul in every hour of trial and tribulationThen knowledge through our Lordand Saviour Jesus Christ is the grand key which unlocksthe glories and mysteries of the kingdom of heavenCompare this principle of knowledgewhich thus unlocks the glories and mysteries of theKingdom with Christendom at the present time andwhere are they with all their religion piety and sacredness?Yet at the same time they are crying out againstProphets Apostles Angels Revelations Visions &cWhy they are just ripening for the damnation ofhell. They will be damned for they reject themost glorious principle of the Gospel of Jesus Christand treat with disdain and trample under foot themain key which unlocks the heavens and putsinto our possession the glories of the celestial worldYes I say such will be damned with all theirprofessed godliness"Then I would ^also^ exhort you to go onand continue to call upon God until you make yourcalling and election sure for yourselves by obtainingthis more sure word of prophecy and waitpatiently for the promise until you obtain it"Many other choice remarks were madeon this occassion which I did not note down.After the close of the meetings ofthat Sunday at which George A Smith Lorenzo Snowand myself also took parts we rode to Lima and took

 of ten thousand personsOn this day May the 22nd the ceremony of marriage was performed by Elder Woodruff between Mr Edward Ockey and Miss Eliza Brewer both from Castle Froom Herefordshire at the house of Elder J. W. Latson in the presence of the quorum of the Twelve.This was the first marriage ceremony I ever officiated in and I was much interested in the welfare of the bride and brid[e]groom for they were both my children in the Gospel and Elder Edward Ockey had not only been munificient in gifts to me but he has also given between two and three hundred pounds to help the poor Saints to emigrateOn the Sunday after we landed the Council of the Twelve met; and afterwards at our meeting place the National Hall Canal Street for public worship. There was a large congregation Many of the citizen were present besides the Saints from London Liverpool Manchester and various parts of England Ireland and ScotlandWhile in New York, with Dr Bernhisel Willard Richards and George A SmithI visited the Frigates Brandy wine and North Carolina and crossed the river to Jersey side went through the steam ship of war then building for the Emperor of Rusia. We also visited some of thepublic buildings of New YorkOn the last of May with my brotherin-law Ilus Carter I took steamboat to start to my family in the State of Maine for my wife soon after the death of my daughter was with my infant son Willford taken to the home of her father by her brother, ^and brother in law^ CarterOn the 2nd of June I arrived at Scarborough per stage and was once more permitted to embrace my wife and also my first 
 supper with Calvin Bea^by^ and while we were conversingwith brother Joseph and brother Morely we were treatedto the followingSayings of the Prophet"The way to get along in any important mattersis to call unto yourself wise men experienced andaged to assist in council in all times of trouble"Handsome men are not wise andstrong minded men. The strength of a strong mindedman will create course features like a rough andstrong bough of the oak. You will always discoverin the first glance at a man in the outline of his features something of the mind of the man"Excitement has almost become theessence of my life. When that dies away I feelalmost lost. When a man is reined up continuallyhe becomes strong and gains power and knowledgebut when he relaxes for a season he loses muchof his powerBut in all matters whether temporalor spiritual preaching the Gospel or leading anarmy to battle victory almost entirely depends uponmoderation and good discipline.

 [first half of page blank]New Year's DayI found myself in the metropolis of England the mostfamous city of the world and with me Heber C Kimballand we both were in the enjoyment of good healthThe Church of Latter-Day Saints on thisnew year's day 1841 in the City of London numbered 21souls and I celebrated the commencement of the newyear by baptizing two into the fold of Christ. We dinedat Dr Copeland's.There was a heavy thunder storm onthe Sunday which damaged some of the churches inthe City. Notwithstanding we in the afternoon preachedin the Academy communed with the Saints andconfirmed two and ^preached^ again in the eveningWe took tea with the Rev James Albon and Mr Spencer and were told that there was quite astir in the Indipendant Church where I had preachedthe Sunday previous. Most of the Committee whowere eight in number were with their pastor beleivingin our mission and there was a prospect of their beingbaptized while others were much stirred up andopposing.A few days after in the evening weaccompanied the Rev. Mr Albon to London Dock to 
 born son whom I had not before seen. After 2 years ofseperation from my wife it was a happy meeting nowHere I stayed with my fatherin-law until the 5th of July and then left for my native place Farmington where I arrived on the 3rd day after.While tarrying at my father's house I married my sister Eunice Woodruff to Mr DwightWebster. AtMy Sister's Marriagethere were between 40 and fifty persons mostly our relatives This was on the 4th of August 1841A few days afterwards my aunt Bulah Hartwas baptized into the Church and on the 18th of the month I bade farewell to my father's house after a stay of forty one days. This was a longer visit than I had paid to any of my friends for the last ten yearsTwo days after we reached New Haven the capitol of my native State which I had not seen for 15 years and it gave me pleasure to see it once moreI arrived in New York with my family on the 21st. Here I learned the general news of the day which was fully ominous and rumours of war between England and America heard on every handThe Millennial Stars from England as well as the letters received informed me of the rapid progress of the work in that country in the midst of unparalelled opposition.From the Times and Seasons I gathered the items that the work in Nauvoo was progressing in the midst of opposition and that all the returned members of the Twelve excepting myself had arrived there. It also brought the melancholy tidings of the death of Don Carlos Smith editor of the Times and Seasons The news generally informed me both of the success and unequalled efforts both in America and England to overthrow the Church. All earth and hell seemed united for one great effort. Public meetings were being held and news papers teening against us. 
 so constituted and were so determined and perseveringeither in righteousness or wickedness that God visitedthem immediately either with great judgements or blessings"If the present generation obtain any assistance fromGod they will have to obtain it by faith."As I had spent most of my time for the lastten years in the vineyard and would probably spendmuch more in the future the brethren and myselftalked over the desireableness of my building a housefor my family to be comfortable in my absence.Several profered to assist me to brick and other materialsand brother John Fidoe would superintend the buildingSo on the 22nd of May we went on to the groundand laid out the dimensions of the houseNext day the Twelve set apart EldersNoah Rogers Addison Pratt Benjamin F. Grouardand Knowlton Hanks to take mission to the Sandwich Islands and Elders Hedlock and J Carnes to EnglandElder Hedlock was appointed to preside afover the BritishIsles. The Spirit of the Lord was with us insetting apart these brethren and the blessings pronouncedupon their heads were written by Elder RichardsA TrialbeforeThe Twelve and First PresidencyOn the afternoon of the 27th I met in councilwith the Twelve and First Presidency when the case ofBenjamin Winchester was brought up on trial forslandering the Saints in Philadelphia rejecting the counsel of Hyrum Joseph and the Twelve and fortearing down instead of building upHyrum pledd for mercy Joseph forright and the Twelve decided according to the testimony 
 house of Mr Spencer to hold a meeting. There wereonly six present and five were preachers. One by thename of Canon was full of the devil and hypocrsisyand he rejected our testimony and opposed the workIn fact we found that we could not go out to teach in London without the Devil coming to oppose us.^Bro Young^ In letter to brother Kimball informedus that the two brethren who went from Longton Lancashireto Nauvoo to spy out the land had returned strong in the faithand also told us that 500 Books of Mormon were out ofpress and in the process of bindingAbout this time I baptized the daughterof the Rev. James Albon and the day after Elder Kimballstarted to Woolwich to break up the ground there. Thefollowing Sunday was the first time he preached whenfour persons offered themselves for baptism.They walked up and down the riverThames until 9 o'clock at night to find a place toadminister the ordinance but could not because ofthe mud and ice. So on the morrow they came with Elder Kimball to London to receive the ordinanceof the Gospel.We immediately repared to our privatebath in Tabernacle Square and Elder Kimballbaptized five persons one of whom was Dr William CopelandThis was indeed an interesting occasionand we felt thankful to God to see the cloud beginingto break for we had struggled hard to do the littlewhich had been done.On the 15th of the month we baptizedthree more of brother Morgan's household and on the following Sunday I preached to a full house and to manynew hearers. Several offered themselves for baptismand there had been during the week added unto theChurch seven souls.Next day Elder Kimball receiveda letter from Elder Young who wished us to be 
 On the 9th of September a little company consisting of myself wife and son and four others started on board the boat Sandusky for Albany. Our ultimate destination was Nauvoo w[h]ere we arrived on the 6th of the next month.While on our journey up the rivers and on board the Chesepeak bound for Chicago we stoped at Manitawou Island on account of rough weather where we lay by until 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day and then put off againAt 12 o'clock at night a tremendiousstorm arose. The captain officers crew and passengers all expected to go to the bottom and judging from outward appearences there were twenty chances to onethat we should be lost but I experienced no fear and felt confident that the Lord would save us by some means. We were in the gale 24 hours when we succeeded in returning to Manitau Island.When I left Nauvoo two years before there were not more than a dozen houses in the place but on my return to the City there were several hundredsWe passed by the Temple then building and had a view of it; and then called at the house of Elder Brigham Young. Here we spent the night.Brother Brigham was sick and Heber C Kimball and Willard Richards were with him. We laid hands upon him and he soon recoveredI saw many of my old friends and aquaintances and was informed that others of them were dead.I met with many friends on the day after my return to Nauvoo and also sat in council with the Twelve and was happy once more to meet with my quorum. I moved my things to Elder Kimball's. My wife and child were sick. 
 in the case.Several letters were read touching thesubject and then Elder Winchester made a lengthyspeech trying to justify himself.President Hyrum Smith followed and pleadin behalf of mercyElder George J Adams gavehis testimony against Winchester who afterwardsfollowed him and both spoke several timesJoseph the Prophet arose andrebuked Elder Winchester in the sharpest mannerand said he had a lying spiritAfter hearing the testimony in thecase Brigham Young President of the Twelve said hehad made up his mind and his decision wasthat Elder Winchester should give up his licenseand cease preaching until he should reformPresident Hyrum Smith saidhe should not like to have such a decision givenwithout another trial to give Elder Winchester achance to get more testimony if he couldPresident Young said he shouldthen prefer the case turned over to the High CouncilJoseph said it was not the businessof the High Council but belonged to the Twelve andthey alone for it concerned matters abroad andnot in Nauvoo. The High Council's businesswas to try cases belonging to the city and that ofthe Twelve to regulate the churches and Elders abroadin all the world and Elder Winchester came underthat jurisdictionHyrum urged the case to be put offuntil the next dayJoseph said the case might beput of until the next morning if it would doanybody any good.Then President Brigham Youngarose and spoke in the majesty of his calling 
 ready to set sail for home early in April.The day after brother Heber returned fromWoolwich a second time and we held a prayer meeting in the evening but he was unable to be present at our next preachingmeeting from indispositionDuring this week we both took the lastsittings for our portrait and with Dr Copeland visitedthe largest docks in London.First we visited St Catherine's Dockand after viewing the shipping and freight of every descriptionwe next went to the London DockAmong many other things we saw theEastern Wine Vault. This is much the largest vaultin the world. It is altogether underground and coversnine English acres.The whole vault is supported withtremendous arches and pillars and laid off in the formof streets. It had been built 33 years.We walked through the length andbreadth of the vault with a guide each one carrying alighted lamp in his hand. Over our heads were thestreet and city.This Vault alone contains thirty thousandPipes of the best Port Wine and six thousand Pipes of Sherryand ^the lower^ three minor vaults of great extension filled withthe same article; besides many thousand Pipes of wineand Brandy Gin and other liquors were strewed throughall the docks warfs and storehouses. We had a tastingorder and found the wine of the rarest quality. But it was pitiful to think of the vast sums of moneyspent in intoxicating liquors while thousands werenearly starving for bread in the streetsLeaving this scene we called intoa Jewish Synagogue and stayed during worshipand then returned to our room.I called for Mr Hender and hecame home with me and soon the Rev. James Albon also came and we all went to the bath in 
 I was quite unsettled where to turn or which way to settle myself. Some of my quorum thought it best for me to got to Warsaw with Elder Willard Richards but after meeting in conference with the Twelve it was voted that I should locate myself in NauvooThe temporal business of the Church was laid upon the quorum of the TwelveOn the 30th of October the City Council met & among its business I was appointed one of the city council of Nauvoo.^Commence here^The next day was Sunday and I met with the Twelve and the Presidency at the office of HyrumSmith and spent most of the day in councilJoseph severely reproved Benjamin Winchester for getting out of his place, after which he taught us principle for several hours. He spoke upon the gathering of the nations for the building up of the Kingdom of God &c.Six days afterwards I attended the City Council for the first time and was sworn into my office as councillorOn the seventh which was also Sunday I for the first time since my return with some of the Twelve called upon brother Joseph thence to brother Brigham Young's and then to the meeting.Here I found many hundreds of the Elders and members of the Church gathered and Elder William Clark preached for about two hoursWhen he had closed brother Joseph arose and reproved him as pharisceeical and hypocritical and ^said^ that he had not edified the peopleThe Prophet then delivered unto us an edifying address showing us what temperance faith virtue charity and truth were. He also said if we did not accuse one another God would not accuse us If we had no accuser we should enter into the Kingdom of heaven. He would take us there and if we would not accuse him he would not accuse us. He said 
 and among other remarks he said that his mind was madeup and that neither the remarks of brother Hyrum nor of Josephhad altered it. As for himself he would not sit upon thecase another day. He considered it an insult upon hisoffice and calling as an Apostle of Jesus Christ and hewould not bear it. As for the rest of the Twelve theymight do as they pleased; for himself he would not doso. Benjamin Winchester had despised and rejected thecounsel of the Presidency and the Twelve and had saidthey had no jurisdiction over him in Philadelphia and power to say where he sho^uld^ go &c. But he andothers will find that there is power in the Twelve.We know from whom we have received our powerand who are our benefactors and we are thankfulfor it. Benjamin Winchester has never for thefirst time received our counsel but has gone contraryto it. No one is safe in his hands. He calls Hyrum an old granny and slanders everybody.He says there is contradiction between Hyrum andthe Twelve. There is no contradiction betweenus and Hyrum, is there brother Hyrum. (He answered, "No.")After Brigham closed Joseph saidhe would give us a little counsel if we saw fit totake it. He thought it proper for us to silenceElder Winchester take his license and have himcome to Nauvoo with his family and if he wouldnot do so then let him go out of the ChurchA vote was then taken to that effect.Brother Joseph addressed the Twelve and said"In all your councils and especially on trial you shouldobserve all pertaining to the subject and discern thespirit by which either party is governed. We shouldbe in a situation to understand every spirit andjudge righteous judgement and should not let the councilbe imposed upon by an unruly conduct"The Saints need not think becauseI am familiar with them and am playful and cheerful 
 in Tabernacle Square and I baptized the Rev. Mr Albonand Mr HenderNext day we held a prayer meetingwith the Saints and in the afternoon confirmed oneand blessed one child. We took tea with brother Albonand met a full congregation in the eveningThe Opening of ParliamentJan 26 1841.This was a great day in London and as Travellersfrom another nation as well as missionaries of the Gospel we did not lose the opportunity of witnessingthe opening of the British ParliamentI started in company withHeber C. Kimball and Dr Copeland and several others forSt James Park where we arrived at 10 o'clock andfound the citizens of London massing by tens ofthousands for the purpose of having a view of herMajesty as she passed through the Park to theHouse of Lords to open ParliamentLong before two o'clock the wholeline from Buckingham Palace through St. James'Park along Whitehall and Parliament Street leadingto the House of Lords was one continuous mass ofthe inhabitants of London. The windows of thehouses all along was ^were^ crowded with fashionable dressedladies, in white on Richmond Terrace, and on the stepsat the base of the Duke of York's monument wereimmense bodies of people.It was judged that therewas ^were^ from three to four hundred thousand gatheredon this occasion but notwithstanding this immensebody of people we had the good fortune throughthe favour of one of the Queen's Life Guardsto get a place in the front lineHer Majesty started a quarterbefore 2 o'clock. The cortege consisted of five 
 what many persons called sin was not sin and he did many things to break down superstition.After the close I met with the Twelve and High Priest quorum. The ''Word of Wisdom" having been brought up Elder Brigham Young said, "Shall I break the "Word of Wisdom if I go home and drink a cup of tea? No; Wisdom is justified of her children." The subject was discussed in an interesting manner and the conclusion reached that we should deal with such matters in wisdom and that forced abstinence was not making us free, but putting a yoke upon our necksBaptisimal Font Dedicated The First Baptisms for the Dead.Two weeks afterwards which was Sunday the 21st of November after meeting in council with the Twelve at brother Brigham Young's I met with the General Assembly near the Temple and heard a discourse by Elder Taylor followed by President Hyram Smith.Afterwards the Twelve met at President Young's until 4 o'clock when we repaired to the Baptisimal Font in the Temple for the purpose of baptizing for the dead for the remission of sins and for the healing of the sickIt was truly an interesting scene It was theFirst Fontbuilt in this last dispensation for the glorious provision of the Gospel for the salvation of both the living and the deadIt was dedicated by President Joseph Smith and the Twelve and this was the first 
 that I am ignorant of what is going on. Iniquity ^of any^^kind^ cannot be retained in the Church, of any kind, andit will not fare well where I am for I am determinedthat while I do lead the Church to lead them right"Joseph farther ^said^ as concerning Elder Adamsthat he had given satisfaction to him confessedwherein he had done wrong and had asked formercy intending to take a right course and beginanew in the Church.After much instruction from Joseph the council adjournedOn the 1st of June the quorum of the Twelvemet in Council at President Joseph Smith's store to makesome arrangements to start on their mission to collectfunds for the Temple and Nauvoo House. We each ofus was bound mader a bond of two thousand dollarsfor the faithful performance of our duty in makingstrict returns to the Trustee in Trust of all propertyput into our hands. Elder Aaron Johnson wasmy bondsmanPresident Joseph Smith gave methe followingLetter of CommendationgivenTo Elder Willford Woodruff"To all Saints and Honourable Men of the earth Greeting:"Dear Brethren and Friends,I Joseph Smith a Servant ofthe Lord and Trustee in Trust for the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints do herebycertify that the bearer hereof Willford Woodruffand Elder and one of the Twelve Apostles of 
 carriages containing the attendants of Royalty and the Statecarriage in which were her Majesty and Prince Albertwho sat on her rightThe Queen's Body Guard ^formed^ by the Royal Bluesthe Life Guards did duty on the line. The State carriagewas drawn by eight of the cream coloured Hanoverianhorses which we had seen at the Royal Mews.The whole train passed within tenfeet of us so that we had a fair view of the Queen andPrince Albert both going and returning from the Houseof Lords. Her Majesty was of small stature andplain in features and her dress was a plain whitesatin trimed with white lace and she wore a necklaceof brillants. Prince Albert was quite a handsome manThey continually bowed to the people as they passed alongOn her return to the Palace she appeared much fatiguedIt was the grandest earthly sightI ever saw.Before the close of the month I baptized three more into the Church and on the 2nd of Feb. we went to Stationers Hall near SaintPaul's where Elder Kimball made enquiries concerningthe securing of the copyright of the Book of Mormonand on our way we saw a large fire in Finsbury Squarebut it was partly extinguished.The following evening we helda meeting and had a good time and appointed acommittee to hire a preaching room. They were DrCopeland Rev James Albon and Priest John Cooper.Brother ^Albon^ wished to make Elder Kimball and myselfa gilt frame each for our portraits which we acceptedI received a letter from Elder Kingtoninforming me that he had commenced building up aChurch in the city of Bristol. He had baptized fiveand organized a Branch of nine members.On the 4th we took the rail toGreenwich which stands upon the banks of the 
 time the font had been prepared for the reception of candidates on the SabathA large congregation assembled and Elders Brigham Young Heber C Kimball and John Taylor went forward and baptized about forty persons and Elders Willard Richards George A Smith and myself assisted in confirming them Afterwards I spent the evening with the quorum of the Twelve at brother Heber C. Kimballs.On the 24 of this month I took charge of the Provision Store for the Committee of the Nauvoo HouseThe next day about 200 Saints landed at Warsaw from England and there being a heavy snow storm I sympathized with them under the hard circumstances of their arrivalThe following Sunday was spent at Brigham Young's with the Twelve and Joseph conversingupon a variety of subjects. It was an interesting day Elder Joseph Fielding was present having been four years on mission to England. We also saw a number of the English brethren.Joseph the Prophet said thatThe Book of Mormon was the most correct as the word of God of any Book on Earth and that a man would get nearer to God by abiding in its precepts than by that of any other book. He said it is the key stone of our religion.Next Sunday with my wife and sister Kimball I spent a part of the day at brother Rushtons with a number of the Pottery Saints from Staffordshire.Indeed I was now in the midst of hundreds whom I had baptized in America the Islands of the Sea and in England and Wales who had now gathered to Nauvoo and I was occassionally receiving and paying them visits. Among these were Elders Kington Benbow Ockey Brewett Pitt and a number of others whose names are familiar in my history 
 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has depositedwith me his bond and security to my full satisfactionaccording to the resolution of the Conference held in thiscity on the 6th day of April 1843.He therefore is recommend to all Saints andhonourable people as a legal agent to collect ^funds^ for the purposeof building the Nauvoo House and Temple of the Lord.Confident that he will honour this hightrust as well as ardently fulfill his commission as aMessenger of Peace and Salvation as one of the Lord'snoble men I can fervently say, May the Lord clearhis way before him and bless him and bless those thatobey his teachings wherever there are ears to hear andhearts to feel.He is in the language of the Hebrews"The friend of Israel" and worthy to be received andentertained as a man of God. Yea he has (ashad the ancient Apostle) the Good Word that leadethunto Eternal LifeWherefore brethren and friends whileyou hear the assurance of the integrity fidelity and abilityof this servant of the Living God trusting that your heartsand energies will be enlivened and deeply engaged in thebuilding of these houses directed by revelation for thesalvation of all Saints and that you will not rest whereyou are until all things are prepared before you andyou are gathered home with the rest of Israel to meetyour God, I feel strong in the belief and have a growingexpectation that you will not withhold any means in your power that can be used to accomplish this gloriouswork.Finally as one that greatly desiresthe salvation of man let me remind you all tostrive with a Godly zeal for virtue holiness and thecommandments of the Lord. Be wise be just beliberal and above all be charitable, always aboundingin all good works. And may health peace and 
 Thames and is the place from which Europeans andAmericans take their longitudeWe walked from Greenwhichto Woolwich also upon the banks of the Thames andthe most important naval and military post in EnglandThere was at this time a smallchurch at Woolwhich numbering six members whichhad been raised up by Elder Kimball. That eveningwe met five of them at brother Bates and wefound the Woolwhich Saints though few firmin the faith.It was very cold the next dayand I spent the morning of the fire side of brotherBates reading the Life and Death of the ReverendJohn Fletcher but in the afternoon we took a viewof the town and its places of note and in spite ofthe cold we had a most interesting time.First we visited the Artillaryand Marine Barracks passed through andhad a view of their Drill and Parade groundAs cold as it was there werea number of companies on parade and new recruitsunder drill and one horse company exerssising. Therewere many hundreds of cannon which we sawand inspected one measuring 16 feet in length 3 1/2 indiameter at the britch and 2 at the mouthThere were two soldiers beingburried at the time and with the usual militarydisplay. We were present and saw them loweredinto the grave side by side. Then the chaplain readthe burial service and a company of soldiers firedthree rounds over their graves and retired. Alltended to make the view before us picturesquethough the latter scene gave a melancholy shadeWe next visited the Dock andPrison Yard. This is the largest and most interestingDock Yard in the world. 
 In the evening we walked to Brother Josephs and spent several hours with him and Sister Emma and had a very pleasant visitJoseph had commenced this day to proofread the Book of Mormon that it might be sterotyped. He had read 60 pages. He rehearsed over to us the Missouri transactions and spoke of the death of David Patten and the request which he made of him in his last dying moments.Two weeks later in the evening of Sunday I met with the Twelve at Joseph's the Seers and heard a discourse delivered by Heber C Kimball He spake of the parable of Jeremiah concerning the Potter and the clay. [##Jeremiah 18:1-6##] He said that when it was marred in the hands of the potter it had to be thrown asside to go into the next batch and was accounted as a vessel of dishonour but that which formed well and was pliable in the hands of the Potter became a vessel of honour. So also he said it was with the human ^family^ and their Creator. Joseph said that brother Kimball had given the true explanation of the parableAfter Sidney Roberts had further occupied the meeting for a season Joseph the Seer arose and read from the New Testament the parable of the "Vine" and its "Branches" and explained it much to our edification [##John 15:1-8##]The Prophet observed during his remarks that some said he was a fallen prophet because he did not bring forth more of the word of the Lord Why does he not do it? was their cry. We are able to receive it!" But he said unto us "No not one in this room is preparedIn revelation he remarked "that a man might command his son to do a thing and before he had done it and with sufficient reason before he had done ittell him to do something else and it was considered right. But if the Lord gives a command and afterwards

Heasked "What was the object of gathering theJews or the people [blank] of God together in any ageof the world? The main object was to buildunto the Lord an House whereby he could reveal unto His people the ordinances and glories of hisKingdom and teach them the ways of salvation; forthere are certain ordinances and principles whichwhen they are taught and practised must bedone in a House or Temple built for that purposeThis was ordained in the mind ofGod before the world was and it was for this purposethat He designed oft to gather together the Jews butthey would not.It is for the same reason thatGod gathers together the people in the last days 
 On passing through the gate into the yard we recordedour names and residences on a book and was then conductedby Mr John Finsbury policeman to all parts of the yardand saw all the branches of business carried on by governmentthere.There are employed in this yard hundredsof hands besides seven hundred prisoners. These wereengaged in building vessels steem boats ships of war makinganchors cables chains boilers cannon shot ^&c^ The fires orbellows were all worked by steem and the operation of theengines were pointed out to us.Among many other curiousities we sawthe Hydrolic Press by which the strength of all the anchorsand cables are tested. With this small Press they canreadily break 150 tons weight and can snap an anchorof five tons into pieces like a pipe stemThere were specimens of timberwhich had been buried in the earth to see whichwould stand the longest and it was found that theEnglish Oak stood the longestWe saw the boat in which CaptianRoss and his comrads were saved. Then we wenton to the upper deck of the new 120 gun ship TrafalgarIt had been upon the stocks a number of years butwas to be launched the following May. It wasconsidered as large as any ship then on the sea. Healso saw the convict shipWe left the Dock yard and wentto Bro Painter's house and had refreshments and thenwe took the steam boat for London.A letter from sister Young to ElderBrigham Young informed us that the Prophet Josephwas going to write for the Twelve to hold a Conferencein England in the Spring ordain as many as theydeemed wisdom and to ^send^ them to all parts where theycould and then for the Twelve to return to NauvooIn the weekly Despatch we read of thewreck of the Packet Ship Garrick in which Elder Kimball and 
 revokes it and commands something else then the Prophet is considered a fallen Prophet""Because the Church will not receive chastisment from the hand of the Prophet and Apostles the Lord chastises us with sickness and death.""Let not any man publish his own righteousness Others can do that for him. Rather let him confess his sins and then he will be forgiven and bring forth more fruit.""The reason why we do not have more of the secrets of the Lord revealled unto us is because we do not keep even our own secrets but reveal them and make our difficulties known even to our enemies""What greater love hath any man than that he lay down his life for his friends. [##John 15:13##] Then why not stand by them unto death""These and many other matters Joseph spoke and enlarged upon to our great edificationElder Brigham Young arose and said that one thing rested with weight upon his mind namely that we ought to be prepared to keep each commandment as it came from the mouth of the Prophet and as the Lord had commanded us to build a Temple we should do it speedilyChristmas DayOn Christmas day the Twelve took supper by invitation at Mr Hyrum Kimballs. It was excellent sleighing and I got horses and sleigh and carried the wives of the Twelve to our host's and home again after our party broke up.Our company consisted of Brigham Young Heber C Kimball Orson Pratt Willard Richards John Taylor and myself and and our wives except Sister Richards who was attending Sister HydeWe had an excellent feast and before we left Mr Kimball made each one of the Twelve a presentof a Lot of land and made out a bond for a deed to the whole of the quorum. Each lot was worth 50 dollars making 
 to build unto Him an House to prepair them with ^for the^ ordinancesendowments washings anointings &cOne of the ordinances of the House ofthe Lord is baptism for the dead. God decreedbefore the foundation of the world that this ordinanceshould be administered in an House prepared for thatpurpose.If a man obtains the fulness of the Gospelhe must get it in the same way that Jesus obtained it andthat was by keeping all the ordinances of the House ofthe LordMen will say I will never forsake youbut will stand by you at all times yet the moment youteach them some of the mysteries of God that are retainedin the heavens and are to be revealed to the children ofmen when they are prepared that moment they will be thefirst to stone you and put you to death. It was uponthe same principle and the same spirit which crucifiedthe Lord Jesus Christ"I will say something about the Spiritsin Prison. There has been much said upon the wordsof Jesus to the "Thief on the Cross" saying "This day thoushalt be with me in Paradise [##Luke 23:43##]The Comentators and Translators makeJesus to say Paradise. But what is Par[adise]? It isa modern word and does not answer at all to the originalwhich Jesus used. There is nothing in the original of anylanguage signifying Paradise. But it was "This day I willbe with thee in the world of Spirits" and will teach thee oranswer thy inquiries. The "Theif on the Cross" was to bewith Jesus Christ  in the world of Spirits. He did not sayParadise or heaven.The ^Refer^ doctrine of Baptism for the Deadis clearly shown in the New Testament and if the doctrineis not good then throw away the New Testament but if itis the Word of God then let the doctrine be acknowledgedof GodIt was one of the reasons why Jesus said to the 
 Hyde crossed the Atlantic twice.On the 7th we baptized Mrs SusannaM. Sangiovanni at which I took great satisfactionfor she was the daughter of David W. Rogers ofMontrose. She was married to an Italian whowas a very jealous man and an unbeleiver in theBible or any of the word of God and he would notgrant her any religious privileges. But this morningshe had come to be baptized and returned home rejoicingwith her whole heart. There was also one baptizedthe day before.This was Sunday and in theafternoon we communed with the Saints experienceda profitable time and had a full house and inthe evening Elder Kimball preached to a fullcongregation and I followed him. The people paidgood attention and the Lord was with us greatly.The Book of MormonEnteredAt Stationers Hall.We received on the 8th a package of 20 Booksof Mormon and two dozen Hymn Books andHeber C Kimball and myself went to the StationersHall and secured the copyright of the Book ofMormon in the name Joseph Smith Jur. We left five copies of the book and paid three shillingsIn the evening we baptizedfour persons one of whom was the wife of the Rev.James Albon who had already received the GospelElder Brigham Young per letterinformed us of the large imigration of that seasonThere were to go on one ship 235 and on another 100.To the reader aquainted with theimmense emigrations of the Saints in later yearsour consideration of the sailing of three or fourhundred as a large emigration will perchance at^be noteworth.^ 
 for the whole six hundred dollars. My Lot was No 4 Block 10 in Kimballs addition to NauvooNext day Joseph called upon me and others of the Twelve to attend meeting at his house in the evening. Many good principles were presented by Joseph and Hyrum such as "Speak not in tongues to your own nation but to those of another nation and then it would condem the unbeleiver; for the Lord does not work in vain. Joseph spoke much on the 14. ch of 1 Cor. upon prophesies ceasing.The following day the Twelve spent with Joseph the Seer and he unfolded to them many glorious things at the Kingdom of God the privileges and blessings of the Pristhood &c. I had the privilege for the first time ofSeeing the Urum ThummimI spent the week as usual in my daily labours and thus closed the year by my recording on the last day in my Journal a synopsis of my travels & labours in the ministry during 1841Synopsis of The Travels and Laboursof Willford Woodruff in 1841.Towns & Cities visited during the year.In England and Wales:London Bristol Liverpool Preston ManchesterStaffordshire Potteries Wolverhampton BirminghamWorcester Hereford Ledbury Malvern Hills 
 Jews "How oft would I have gathered you together" &c [##Matthew 23:37##] sothat they might have attended to the ordinance of Baptismfor the Dead as well as other ordinances and for thePriesthood and Revelations of God, &c. This was the caseon the Day of Pentecost. The blessings were poured outupon the disciples on that occasionThere has also been much said aboutthe word Hell and the sectarian world have preachedmuch about it. But what is hell? It is anothermodern term and is taken from Hades, the Greek, orShaole, the Hebrew; and its true signification is a world of spirits. Hades Shaole Paradise Spiritsin Prison is all one. It is a world of SpiritsThe Righteous and the Wicked all go to the same^world^ of SpiritsSays one I beleive in one Hell and one Heaven.All are equally miserable or equally happy. But StPaul informs us of three glories and three heavensHe knew a man caught up to the third heavens [##2 Corinthians 12:2##] andJesus said there were many mansions in his Father'sKingdom [##John 14:2##]Any man might beleive that JesusChrist is Godd and be happy in the beleif and yet notobey his commandments.A man of God should be endowed withall wisdom knowledge and understanding in order toteach and lead the people. The blind may lead theblind and both fall into the ditch together.There is much said concerning Godthe Godhead &c. The Scriptures says there are Godsmany and Lords many. The teachers of the daysay that the Father is God the Son is God andthe Holy Ghost is God and that they are all in oneperson and are one GodJesus prayed that those whom theFather had given him out of the world might be"one in us as we are one"; [##John 17:21##] but if they were to 
 the first sight seem a small notion. But this was in the early rise of the European Mission and moreover in 1840 thedoctrine of emigration from father land among the Englishwas repugnant. Emigration had not then as now become aninstitution of modern times. Out of this Church it wasconsidered among the peasantry and manifacturing classesof England as a calamity and was never accepted by themfrom choice. Not until misfortune panics in tradeor dire necessity came did they accept emigration fromfather-landAt this time then came the Latterday Saint Apostles and elders preaching to countryloving Englishman the doctrine of emigration from theirnative land   and preaching the doctrine chiefly to thosewho mostly perhaps had not seen a score of miles of thegreat world outside their village, homes. Well mightwe then in 1840 consider the emigration of fourhundred Saints as a large matter.Elder Kimball and myself at this timeprepared a tract for the press to present to the citizensof London before we left the first principles of theGospel and commission given by Jesus to his ancientApostles.Elder Lorenzo Snow arrivedin London on the 11th to take charge of the churchafter our departure. I was truly glad to once moregreet him for I had not seen him since 1837On the same day Elder Wm Pittalso arrived at our lodgings and we had an interestingmeeting in the evening. Brother Snow preachedand Elder Kimball and myself followed him andthe next ^day^ brothers Heber and Lorenzo went toWoolwich to give impetous to the work of Godin that important town.There was great excitement at thattime both in the House of Parliament and throughoutEngland in consequence of the apprehension andimprisonment of Mr  M.

 be stuffed ^put^ into one person they would make a great God. IfI were to testify that the world was wrong on this pointit would be true. Peter says that Jesus sat on the righthand of God [##1 Peter 3:22##] and any person who has seen the heavensopened knows that there are three personages in the Heavensholding the Keys of power"As the Father hath power in himselfso also hath the Son power in himself". Then the Fatherhas at some time laid down his body and taken it againso he has a body of his own. So has also his son.Many of the Sects cry out I have thetestimony of Jesus. I have the Spirit of God; but awaywith Jo Smith. He says he is a Prophet but there is tobe no Prophets nor revelations in the last days. Butstop Sirs. The Revelator says, "the testimony of Jesusis the spirit of prophecy," [##Revelation 19:10##] So by your own mouth youare condemnedBut to the text. Why gather the peopletogether in this place? For the same reason that Jesuswanted to gather the Jews to receive the ordinances theblessings and the glories that God has in store for hisSaints.And I will now ^here^ ask this Assembly andall the Saints if they will now build this house andreceive the ordinances and blessings which God has instore for you or will you not build unto the Lordthis House and let Him pass by and bestow theseblessings upon another. I pause for a reply.About this time in company with several othersI started to fence and plant a five acre lot of prairieWe had not got far before the reach of our wagonbroke and we were all thrown into a pile togetherand the wheel went on my arm and bruised itconsiderably. But we mended up and continued 
 in Lockport Jail by the State of New York which wastrying him for arson and murder, and the Americanswere determined to execute him if found guilty.The accusation was the burning ofthe Caroline on Lake Erie in 1834 during the troublesin Canada. England considered it a national andnot an individual affair and that M. C. Cleod actedby order of the British Government and not upon hisown responsibility. Under these considerationsParliament was determined to demand his release and defend his life even at the expence of immediatewar with America. Government had sent a special message and instructions to the Britishambassador at Washington. These threateningsof war between England and America made us anxious concerning our return to our countryand the emigration of the Saints to the bodyof the Church.From what I had seen ofEngland of one thing I felt certain and that wasthat if America hazards a war with Englandshe would find it to be more than a joke tomeet so strong a foe and one armed to the teethfor war. Upon the subject I thought andwrote in my daily journal:"Should Truth speak she wouldrepresent England at the present time as the strongestamong the nations and chief in power and main springof the Gentile world. She will remain her seasonas an instrument in the hand of God to bringabout great events, in the restoration of the Jews andto be a scourge to the nations America not exceptedbut she will also receive the scourage and the chasteninghand of the Almighty will fall upon her in turnBut O! America, America! ^whose had is^ choice above all otherlands and ^thou^ established by omnipotant Power! thysalt hath lost it savour thy light hath goneout and thine Eagle's crest is stained with the blood 
 Jan 1842Chapter XIXNew Year's day 1842 found me in the city of Nauvoo with the quorum of the Twelve and our wives spending the day at the house of brother Stodard.It was an interesting occassion for us to meet together with our families at a festive time in the city of the Saints in the midst of peace and love. We could the more highly prize this privilege as we were so often called to be seperated in the vineyard of the LordIt was now my privilege and lot to tarry for a season at home, and to provide for my family This was the first time since I had been in the Church that I had been thus privileged as I had been on missions most of the time for eight yearsAs we had now the commandment of the Lord to build the Temple and the Nauvoo house resting upon us the probability was that the Quorum of the Twelve would spend most of the time in Nauvoo until the Temple was built.On the 10th of the month I sold to brother John Horlick the South half of my lot and bought two lots of Hyrum Kimball for $250 fifty of which I paid him down in cloth and a watch and the other 
 to the prairie and made 82 rods of worm fence withstakes and riders. Just before I left I went to brotherCheney to get a drink of water and his dog bit mevery badly through the calf of my leg. He wasan ugly dog and had bit several persons beforeI was very lame for some days and the next timeI went to my lot I informed Brother Cheney thatI should not be satisfied unless he killed his dogas he was dangerous and in the habit of bitingpersonsJudge Adams of Springfield wroteinforming us that the Governor of Missourihad made another demand for Joseph at the hands of the Governor of Illinois and that Fordof Illinois had issued the writ for his apprehension.Two messengers were immediatelydespatched from Nauvoo to President JosephSmith, who was absent & ^about^ 200 miles from homeat the time, informing him of these facts.This was on the Sunday. andThe Sabath following being ^day^ June 25th in the afternoonHyrum came into the Stand and requested theMasonic Fraternity to meet him in the Lodge Roomin a half an hour. We immediately went downbut a quarter of us could not get into the roomThis being the case We formeda hollow square on the green. Hyrum theninformed us that the Sheriff of Jackson Co. Missouriand Wilson of Carthage had come upon Josephand taken him by surprise presenting each ofthem a pistol to his breast and swaring theywould kill him if he made any resistanceBrother Markham went to hisassistance and they presented pistols to himalso and threatened his life. He approachedthem however to knock down the pistols whenthey again pointed them at Joseph's breast 
 was to be paid in two annual payments; and a week or two afterwards I purchased a house and an acre of land of brother Parsons to be paid for on the 20th of the following AprilSeveral days later I rode to Brother Benbows on the Prar^i^rie six miles from Nauvoo and it being Sunday I preached at his houseThis was the first time that I had visited him since my return to Nauvoo. I spent the time very pleasantly while there. His farm looked almost like the Garden of Eden. I never had seen more work done in one year on a prar^i^rie farm than on his. He had surrounded it and crossed it with heavy ditches and planted thorn hedges His dwelling barns sheds garden yards orchards &c were all beautifully arranged. Indeed Brother Benbow's farm much resembled the farms of old England where as the reader has learned he held the position of a respectable well-to-do-farmer,who cultivated about 300 acres of landThis place was a pleasant retreat for a Summers ride from Nauvoo. The little neighbourhood consisted of five families from England and all well united excepting one family who had denyed the faith.Before my return to the city on the following day I paid to brother John Benbow 200 dollars for President Joseph Smith and endorsed it on his noteI assisted in drawing up from the river two large stones to the Nauvoo house for the threshholds of the doorsA few days previous a revelation was given for the Twelve to obtain the printing establishment of E. Robinson and govern the printing of the Times & Seasons and all the publication of the Church as directed by the Holy GhostAfter consulting upon the subject the quorum of the Twelve appointed Elders John Taylor and Willford Woodruff to take charge of the whole establishment and edit the Times and Seasons under the direction of Joesph the SeerAccordingly on the 3rd of February 3rd I 
 and said they would kill him if Markham approachedthem. So to save Joseph's life Markham forbareand they then took Joseph into Carthage and started forMissouriThey had gone about ten miles when theywere stoped by the inhabitants of the country whoswore they should not carry Joseph Smith any fartherwithout giving him a chance of the law and theytook out a writ of Habeas Corpus in behalf of Joseph anda writ against Sheriffs Reynolds and Wilson and theynow wanted a company to go to Joseph to see that hehad his rightsBrother Hyrum called for volunteersand the whole city flocked together. They made choiceof such as they wished and Generals Law andRich went with about one hundred men on horsebackand somewhere near the same on board the Maidof Iowa. The horsemen left the city at about8 o'clock that night but the boat did not startuntil the next morning.Triumphal Entry of the ProphettoThe City of NauvooFive days afterwards at 1 o'clock in the afternoonthe citizens of Nauvoo, went out in great numberson foot horseback and in carriages to meet the Prophetand when they did meet him there was a sceneof great joyA band of music and a greatmultitude escorted him to his home and Reynoldsof Missouri and Wilson of Carthage who had taken him by force of arms were brought to Nauvoowith ^him^ and they looked as though they had the agueYet Joseph heaped coals of fire upon their heads whohad so inhumanly treated him by taking them to 
 left my station at the Nauvoo Provision Store and commenced to labour for the Church in the Printing Establishment. Elder Taylor and myself spent the afternoon in taking an invoice of the Printing Office which we finished the next day and met at Joseph's Store and E Robinson made out the deed to WillardRichards of his lot and house containing the Printing establishment and all appurtenances belonging thereto amounting in all to $6,600.The following day I assisted Willard Richards in taking in the tithing for the ^Temple^ amounting to about 1000 dollars worth of propertyAbout two weeks later Joseph the Seer presented us with some of the Book of Abraham written by the hand of that Patriarch and which was found in Egypt and ^which^ with some mummies came into the hands of the Prophet several years before. He was now translating them to publish portions of it in the Times and Seasons of which paper he was the Editor and John Taylor his assistant while the business part of the establishment was under my chargeI had been much edified of late in hearing Joseph converse upon the mystries of the Kingdom of God. "Truly," I thought, "the Lord is with him and making him mighty in Knowledge and wisdom" and I was convinced that none of the Prophets or Seers have ever accomplished a greater work than the Lord will bring to pass in the last days through the instrumentality of JosephOn My birthday ^March 1st^ came and I made a feast for my friends and four days afterwards, on the 4th of March in the morning, 30 minutes past 10 ^o'clock^ a.m. my daughter Phebe A. Woodruff was bornA week later the Nauvoo Legion met on parade and in company with the Twelve I rode in the Legion as assistant Chaplain. This was the first time I had seen the Legion on paradeOn the 15th of the ^same^ month the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge was established and organized. The procession was found at half past one oclock at Joseph's 
 his house setting them at the head of his table andcausing the best his house afforded to be served to themby his wife the very woman they had refused tosee her husband when they forced him with thethreatening of arms and ruffian oathsAfter dinner they all repairedto the court Room and Joseph was delivered into thehands of the Municipal Court for trialBefore he went into court Josephmounted a wagon and said to the multitude "I am out of the hands of the Missouriansthank God!"He thanked them for their kindness andlove to him and said that he would address them atthe grove near the Temple at 4 o'clockAfter the case was introduced to theCourt Joseph informed it that he had an appointmentto address the citizens and ask^ed^ the privilege. Thecourt extended the courtesy to him and he went ^the^^court^ adjourned until the next morningAfter the adjournment of his caseJoseph went to the Grove and took the Standin the presence of an assembly of about seventhousand Saints ^to whom he narrated the incidents ofhis arrest and maintaind the prowers of the Charter of Nauvoo forthe protection of its citizens.^Epitomeof  theSpeech of JosephTo the Citizens of NauvooJune 30th 1843I require attention.

 Store and marched to the grove in front of the Temple where the [FIGURE] Lodge was organized and an address delivered by the Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge of Illinois. There were about three thousand assembled on the occasion [FIGURE]On Sunday March the 20th a large assembly gathered at an early hour to hear a discourse from Joseph upon the subject of baptism, but as a young child wsa dead and his corps brougt in the assembly it called forth many remarks upon death and the resurrection. I reported and recorded in my JournalA Brief Synopsis of the Sermon of Joseph the ProphetThe speaker read the 14 ch of Revelations and said:"We have again the warning voice Sounded in our midst "which shows the uncertainty of human life. And in my "leasure moments I have meditated upon the subject and asked the question, Why is it that inocent children are takenaway from us especially those who seem to be the most intelligent beings?"The Answer: [FIGURE]"This world is a very wicked world and it is a proverb that it grows weaker and wiser, but if this is the case it is also true that the world grows more wicked and corrupt"In the early ages of the world a righteous man a man of God and intelligence had a better chance to do good, to be received and beleived than at the present day. In these days such a man is much opposed and persecuted by most of the inhabitants of the earth and he has much sorrow to pass through. Hence the Lord takes many away even in infancy that they may escape the envy of man and the sorrows and evils of the present ^and they were too true and too lovely to live on earth^ world. Therefore I rightly considered instead of mourning we have reason to rejoice as they are delivered from the evil and we shall soon have them again. 
 gratitude to Almighty God and I presume you all feel thesame.I hardly know how to express my feelings.I feel as strong as a giant. I pulled sticks with themen coming along and with one hand I pulled upthe strongest man there was on the road with onehand and two could not pull me up; and I continuedto pull until I pulled them to Nauvoo. But I willpass from that subject.There has been great excitement inthe country but since those men took me I havebeen cool and dispassionate through the whole.Thank God I am now in the handsof the Municipal Court of Nauvoo and not in the handsof Missourians.It has been discussed by the greatand wise men lawyers and thereir like: Oh yourpowers and legal tribunals are not to be sanctionedand so we will make it lawful to drag away inocentmen from their families and friends and have themunlawfully put to death by ungodly men for theirreligion.Relative to our charter, courts, rightof Habeaus Corpus &c we have all power; and ifany man from this time fourth says anythingcontrary cast it into his teethThere is a secret in this. If thereis not power in our charter and courts then thereis not power in the State of Illinois nor in theCongress nor Constitution of the United States; forthe United States gave unto Illinois her constitutionand charter; and Illionois gave unto Nauvoo hercharter which have ceded unto us our vestedrights and she has no right nor power to takethem from us. All the power there was inIllinois she gave to Nauvoo and any man whosays to the contrary is a foolI want you to teach ^learn^, O! Israel, what 
 "What chance is there for infidelity when we are "parting from our friends daily? There is none at all. "The infidel will grasp at every straw for help until "death stares him in the face and then his infidelity takes "its flight; for the realities of the eternal world are "resting in mighty power upon him. When every earthly "support and prop fails him he then sensibly feels the "eternal truths of the immortality of the soul."Concerning the doctrine of baptizing or sprinkling "children or they must welter in hell the doctrine is "not true nor supported in Holy Writ and it is not "consistant with the character of God""The moment children leave this world "they are taken into Abraham's bosom. The only difference between the old and young dying is that one lives longer in heaven and eternal light and glory them the other and was freed a little sooner from this misserable wicked world. Notwithstanding all this glory we for a moment loose sight of it and mourn the loss but we mourn not as those without hope."We should take warning and not wait for the death bed to repent. As we see the infant taken away by death so may the youth and middle aged as well be called suddenly into eternity Let this then prove as a warning to all not to procrastinate repentance nor wait till a death bed comes for it is the will of God that man should repent and serve Him in health and strength and in the power of his mind in order to secure his blessing and ^not^ to wait until he is called to die.""My intention was to have treated upon the subject of baptism; but having a case of death before us I thought it proper to refer to that subject. I will now however say a few words upon baptism as designed."God has made certain decrees which 
 what is for the happiness and peace of this city andpeople for our enemies are determined to oppress usand deprive us of our rights and privileges as theyhave done; If the authorities that be on theearth will not assist us in our rights nor giveus that protection which the laws and constitutionof the United States and of this State guaranteeunto us then we will claim them from HigherPower from Heaven from God Almighty forour constitutional rightsI swear I will not deal so mildlywith them again for the time has come whenforbearance is no longer a virtue; and if you areagain taken unlawfully you are at liberty to giveloose to blood and thunder but act withAlmighty powerBut good luck to me as italways has been in every time of trouble, friendsthough they were strangers were raise up ^un^to meand assisted me.

No. Neither are the charters granted unto Nauvoo by the Legislature of Illinois and those who say they are, are fools.We have not our rights. Those which the Constitution of the United States grant and which our charters grant we have not enjoyed unmolested.Missouri and all wicked men will raise the Hue and cry against us and are not satisfied. But what are they going to do to help them selves? What will mobocrats do in the midst of this people. If mobs come upon you any more here dung your gardens with them. But says one you will get up excitement. We will get up no excitement except what we can find an escape from. We will rise up Washington-like and break off the wheight which bears us down and we will not be mobbed.To give you an account of my journey I will tell you an anecdote which may be pleasingA day before I was taken I rode with my wife through a neighbourhood to visit some friends; and I said to Mrs Smith, "Here are a good people". I felt this by the Spirit of God. The next day I was in their hands ^midst^ a prisoner ^and^ with^they stood by me^ Wilson who said as he drove up, "Ha! ha! ha!By God we have got the Prophet!" He gloried much in it but he is now our prisoner.When Reynolds of Missouri and Wilson of Carthage came to take me ^instead^ ^of tapping^ me on the shoulder and saying "You are my prisoner" with two cocked pistols at my head their first salutation was "God damn you I will shoot you! I will shoot you. God damn you I will shoot you!"This they did nearly fifty ^times^ first and at last, I asked them what the wanted to shoot me for. 
 "If you make any resistance.""Oh! very well said I. I have no resistance to make."They then draged me away; and while on the road I asked them by what authority they did they these things:They said, "By a writ from the Government of Missouri and Illinois"I then told them I wanted a Writ of Habaeus Corpus. The reply was,"God damn you! You shant have it."I told a man to go to Dixon and get me a Writ of Habaeus Corpus. Wilson answered"God damn you! You sha[n]t have it. I will shoot you!"I sent for a lawyer to come. One came; and Reynolds shut the door in his face and would not let me speak to him and said again "God damn you! I will shoot you!"I turned to him opened my bosom and told him to shoot away and I did ^it^ frequently.I told Mr Reynolds that I would have council to speak to; and the lawyers came to me and I got a Writ of Habaeus Corpus for myself and a writ against Wilson and Reynolds for unlawful proceedings towards me and cruel treatment.They could not get out of town that night. I pledged my honour to my council that the Nauvoo Charter had power to investigate the subject and we came to Nauvoo by common consent and I am now a prisoner of higher authority. Yes higher authority: before yourselvesThe Charter expressly say that the City Council shall have power to enact all laws for the benefit and convenience of said city not contrary to the constitutions of the United States and that of this State; and also says the Municipal 
 Court shall have power to grant Writ of Habeaus Corpus in all cases arising under the ordinances of the city councilThere is nothing but what we have power over except ^that^ restricted by the Constitution of the United States or of this State. This is in accordance with the Constitution of the United StatesBut says the mob "What dangerous powers!"But the Constitution of the United States is not dangerous against good men neither is that of this State.but to bad men the breakers of the lawAs with the laws of the country so with the ordinances of Nauvoo. They are dangerous to mobs but not to good men who wish to keep the lawWe do not go out of Nauvoo to disturb anybody nor any city town or place. Why need they be troubled about us? Let them not meddle with our affairs but let us alone.After we have been deprived of our rights and privileges as citisens driven from town to town place to place and State to State, with the sacrifice of our homes and lands our blood shed and many murdered and all this because of our religion because we worship Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, shall we longer bear these cruelties which have been heaped upon us for the last ten years in the face of heaven and in open violation of the Constitution and laws of the United State and of this State?May God forbid! I will not bear it. If they take away my rights I will fight for my rights I will fight for my rights manfully until I am used up with blood and thunder sword and pistol.We have done nothing against lawand right.As touching our City Charter and laws there is a secret. What is it? Our laws go behind the writ and investigate the subject i.e. ^that is to say^ of Habeaus Corpus while other laws do not go behind the writYou speak of lawyers. I am a 
 It did my soul good to see your feelings and love manifested towards me. I thank God that I have the honour to lead so virtuous and honest a people to be your leader and lawyer^er^ ^giver^ as Moses was to the children of Israel. Hosannah! Hosannah! Hosannah to the name of the Most High God. I commend you to His grace and may the blessings of heaven rest upon you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.Furthermore if Missouri continues her warfare and continues to issue writs against me and this people unlawfully and unjustly as they  ^it^ have ^has^ done and our rights are trampled upon and taken away I sware with uplifted hands towards heaven I will spill my blood in the defence. They shall not take away our rights and if the^y^ do not stop leading me by the nose I will lead them by the nose and if they do not let me alone I will turn up the world. I will make war! When we shake our own bushes we want to catch our own fruitThe lawyers themselves acknowledge that we have all power granted us in our charters that we could ask for that we had more power than any other court in the State for all other courts were restricted while ours was not and I thank God Almighty for it and I will not be rode down to hell by the Missourians any longer and it is my privilege to speak in my own defence and appeal to your Honors.Next day July the 1st the case of Joseph Smith came before the Municipal Court of Nauvoo. Brigham Young Hyrum Smith Parley P. Pratt Lyman Wight and Sidney Rigdon were called upon as witnesses 
 and duly sworn.The testimony of these witnesses occupied nearly the entire day. They recountered the whole history of the persecution from Jackson County to the time of their expulsion from the State of Missouri by force of arms.It was heart-rending to hear the rehersal Never was gthere given to any tribunal a history of barbarities and religious persecution more disgraceful to civilization for it was in the Nineteenth century and in America. Yet that tribunal heard that day a history of persecution in many atrocious forms among which were the scenes of prisons chains rape murder and expulsion and heard the horrible fact that when Joseph and his companions were in prison loaded with chains they were fed with nothing forfive days in succession but the flesh of their own ^murdered^ Brethren which was actually cooked and given them to eat. This horrible fact they afterwards discovered from the exultation of the monsters who who the cause of this fiendish circumstance.While hearing this part of the testimony my blood boiled within me and the spirit of war was aroused. The Gentile Lawyers who had the management of the case were shocked to the soul and Mr Wallker and the three other legal gentlemen each made a speech councselling us to stand for our rights at any issue.The 4th of July was a great and happy day with us in Nauvoo. Joseph had just been again delivered from the hands of Missouri and it was also the day of our National IndipendenceAt a very early hour people began to assemble at the Grove and at eleven o'clock there were congregated something near the number of 13,000 persons and the constant accession of others swelled the congregation to fifteen thousand persons as near as could be estimated 
 In the forenoon this vast multitude was addressed by Orson Hyde who had lately returned from Palestine and ^who^ was now under a new appointment, to go on a mission to St Petersburgh Russia.In the afternoon three steamers arrived one from St Louis one from Quincy and the other from Burlington bringing altogether about nine hundred visiting ladies and gentlemen to our city.On the arrival of each boat the visitors were escorted to the Stand by the Nauvoo Band where they were welcomed by the firing of cannon and provided with seats.During the afternoon Parley P. Prattgave a masterly discourse and Joseph followed him upon the subject of his arrest &cSynopsisofThe Defence of JosephBefore Fifeteen Thousand People.If the people will give ear a moment I will address them a few words in my own defence as touching my arrestIn the first place I will state to those who can hear me that I never spent more than six months in Missouri except while in prison While I was there I was at work for the support of my family. I never was a prisoner of war during my stay there for I had not made war. I never took a pistol a gun or a sword and the much which has been said upon the subject is false I have been willing to go before any Governor Judge or Tribunal where justice could be done and have the subject investigated. I could not have committed 
 treason in that State while there. I had no controle anywhere there in temporal things but in spiritual I was driven from that State by force of arms under the exterminating order of Governor BoggsI never committed treason, the people know very well. I have been a peaceable citizen but there has been a great hue and cry about Governor Boggs being shot. No crime can be done but what it is laid to Jo. Smith Here I was again dragged to the United States Court and was cleared and now it comes again But As often as God sees fit for me to suffer I am ready; but I am as inocent of these crimes as the angels in heaven. I am not an enemy to mankind. I am a friend to mankind. I am not an enemy to Missouri nor to any Governors or people.As to the military station I hold and the cause of my holding it, it is thus:When we came here the State required us to bear arms and do military duty according to law; and as the Church had just been driven from Missouri and robbed of all their property and arms they were poor, and destitute of arms. They were liable to be fined for not doing duty when they had no arms to do it with. They came to me for advice. I advised them to organize themselves into indipendant companies and demand arms of the State. This they did. Again there were many Elders having licence to preach which by law ex^onorate^ them from military duty but the officers would not release them on this ground. I then told the Saints that though I was clear of military duty by law in consequence of lameness in one of my legs yet I would set them the example 
 and do duty myself. They then said they were willing to do duty if they could be formed into an indipendant company and I could be at their head. Upon this ground came the Nauvoo Legion and I holding the office of Lieutenant General. Not that I seek for power.And with regard to elections. Some say we all vote together and vote as I say; but I never tell my man how to vote nor who to vote for. But I will show you how we have been situated by bringing a comparison:^Supposing there^ Should there be a MethodistSociety here and two candidates running for office;one says if you will vote for me and put me in Governor I will exterminate the Methodists and take away their charters &c. The other says if I am Governor I will give all an equal privilege.Which would the Methodist vote for? Of course they would vote in mass for the candidate who would give them their rightsThus it has been with us. Joseph Duncan said if the people would elect him he would exterminate the Mormons and take away their charters. As to Mr Ford he made no such threatsbut manifested a spirit in his speeches to give every man his rights. Hence the Church universally voted for Mr Ford and he was elected Governor But he has issued writs against me the first time the Missourians made the demand and this is the second one he has issued for me which has caused me much trouble and expence."Joseph also rehearsed the account of his being taken by Reynolds and Wilson and the unlawful treatment he received at their hands. The multitude gave good attention and much prejudice seemed to be removed 
 ^Chapter XXI^[top of page blank]I arose early on the morning of ^the^ 7th of July laid hands upon Mrs Woodruff and blessed her and our daughter Phebe Amelia and started on my mission.On the afternoon of the sameday we left Morrisons Landing on the steam-boat Rapids.
