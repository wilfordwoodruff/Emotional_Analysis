I closed by making An address concerning  Zion in the following words   rest of page blank ENDENTRY I cannot close my record upon the signs of the times witof 1848 without turning my eye towards Zion, yes Zion, which is not  now merely a phantom of the brain or a name, but actually a  living thing. Truly she is yet but a babe just born. Yet she has A Tabernacle, the Mountains of Israel. Her bed is in the cham- bers of the rocks. Her garden one of the rich valleys of Ephraim  She speaks and Her voice is as the voice of God. She has A spirit  which burns like flames of fire. She has power, And has started  A little stone rolling from the mountain her habitation, which  increases as it goes: it is causing the Earth to quake and tremble,  take care ye Nations it will grind you to dust. She has messengers who go and come at her bidding, one of them can chase A thousand  and two put ten thousand to flight, they command the Element and they obey them. She has An Ensign for the Nations to flee to. She has A law which will soon govern the Earth. She is  born in the generation that David had A view of. O Praise  the LORD I am a witness that mine eyes have beheld her.  She has Keys to open and no man can shut, And shut And no man  can open. Her power is from Heaven whare she hath Noble  senators who plead her cause both day and night. This is the Zion I seek After, this is the Zion I speak off. Her Church is the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Her city  was sought in 1847 And the Lord has favored her from that  that time. And During the year 1848 the Church has been organized with A first Presidency of three persons viz Brigham  Young, Willard Richards, who have gatherd  to the mountains of Israel, in the valley of the Great Salt  lake, Great Basin North America, And taken with them  some three thousand souls with their flocks and Herds, which  makes A population of about seven thousand souls in the  city of the Great Salt Lake. The Lord has also blest their  land which has brought forth in abundance. And while the Lord  has been multiplying blessing upon Zion in her quiete Habitation Her messengers have been crying aloud to the Nations of  the Earth and the Isles of the sea preaching the gospel unto them And uttering their testimony in the power of God And the  gift of the Holy Ghost untill they have gatherd their thousands  together untill one of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb (Orson  Pratt) Estimates that it will take three hundred ships to remove the saints from the British Isles Alone to Zion. The Saints who  were gather into the valley of the Sacramento have discoverd  such vast mines of gold silver copper and other precious ores that the report of it is creating great excitement throughout the world  Esspecially in the United States untill tens of thousands are rushing to the gold regions to try to obtain the precious mettal. And as the hand of God has been so visible in all the signs of 1848 May He continue his work  through 1849 and all following years untill His arm shall be made bare  in the eyes of all Nations. Untill Zion shall arive to her full strength of Manhood  for Brass may she have gold for Iron silver for wood Brass for stones Iron.  May her execters and peace officers be righteous men. May her Nobles be of Ephraim And her Govournor procede out of the midst of Him. May all of her Messengers be armed with righteousness in the power of God in great glory. May all of the Nations of the Earth fear and tremble because of her law. May the wicked find her sons terrible when they go to battle against her and not have power to stand before them. May her dwelling places  be distinguished by a pillar of fire by night and cloud by day, and in fine may she arise  and shine forth And spread herself abroad with all that perfection of beauty power  and glory which has ever been spoken concerning her Even to the full Expectation of God Angels and man  Wilford Woodruff   ENDENTRY February 16, 1849 ~ Friday   16th FIGURE I recieved A letter from Wm Low spent the day writing    ENDENTRY February 17, 1849 ~ Saturday   17th I visited Boston And obtained the New York weekly Herald It was full of news on Calafornia, gold digings, andc large Extracts from the Calafornia Star.

Also made An extract from my address to the Historian concerning Zion andc andc. The following is an Extract of my letter to him FIGURES   Cambridgeport March 1st 1849  Elder Pratt, Beloved Brother, As this is my birth day Also the  first day of Spring, my mind is led this morning more than usual to reflect upon the signs of the times of the Globe upon which we dwell And while meditating upon Zion And Her messengers my mind flits across the Ocean and runs over the wall And takes A view of A large co- mpany of swift messengers who are the Horns of Joseph used to push the people together from the ends of the Earth, these meditations create A desire to convers A few moments with Br Pratt. So while all Nature is locked fast in sleep before the dawn of day is broke to start man from his slumber I seat myself to say A few words to you. I said this was my birth day, yes I am 42 years old this day. How such figures look to a man while counting up his years in this probation. The vary sight of them croud into the mind A flood of thought even more than tongue can utter or pen can write. The last sixteen years of my life has been spent in endeavouring to preach the Gospel and build  up the Kingdom of God in connexion with my brethren. The past is gone, I have no desire to recal it, I would would not wish to live my life over if I could. I feel like looking forward and not backward I have a great desire that I may spend my future days doing the works of righteousness, Honoring the Priesthood and my calling, saving the souls of men, and building up the Kingdom of God that I may have a  place with the faithful at the end of the race. Turn my eyes which way I will Either towards Babylon or Zion And I find the mov- ements and signs of Either of them at the present day Are fully keep- ing pace with the wheels of time. It is deeply interesting to see hear, feel, and live in this age and gaze upon the scenery of the  whole Earth rushing like A Mighty cataract to finish its work while the high minded Jew in the highth of his pride was exha- usting his talents and oratory to prove to the Roman and the world  their right to independance greatness and power. The Son of God was in Lamb like meekness bowing to the ordinance of Baptism And all the rites of the gospel and commandments of his Father looking forward to the day when He should make his second visit to his brethren with his reward upon his head. So at the present day while the Emperors, Kings, Princes, Lords, Nobles, Presidents Governours, Statesman with all the great men of Babylon have been making A desperate Effort to maintain their dignity And appear to a good Advantage before the whole Earth   ENDENTRY many of the most Noble spirits that ever dwelt in flesh  like Jesus and the Apostles have been meekly submitting to  the ordimances of the gospel, and like little children have  been subject to the Authority of the Holy Priesthood And have  made evry sacrafize required and laboured day and night to build up Zion that the honest in Heart and the meek of the Earth may have A place to flee to in order to Escape the just judgment of ^that^ God whose rod is now suspendend in the Heavens and is about  to Fall upon the Earth and lay great Babylon with all of Her  greatness, pomp, power, and glory in the dust. My Prayer to God  is that evry Elder of Israel and saint of God throughout the whole  Earth may be incouraged to labour dilligently and faithfully  while the day of Harvests lasts for soon night will come when  No man can work, theyn ^they^ will be Just as sure of their reward As was their chief captain and Head.    ENDENTRY March 3, 1849 ~ Saturday   3rd FIGURES I wrote A letter to Mr Anapolis Md. I  Also recieved A letter from Whipple called upon  me And spent the Afternoon I had A good time with him we conversed upon A variety of subjects Among other things He informed me that  the Utah Lake abounded with the largest kind of the Mountain trout some As much as two and three feet in length And that all the small and large streams puting out of the Mountains Also  Abounded with trout.

ENDENTRY March 4, 1849 ~ Sunday   FIGURE 4th Sunday The United States is without A President to day  President Polk went out last night President Taylor is installed to morrow. Hence there is no president to day I met A congregation of saints And many strangers at Brother  Valley of  the Salt Lake was present. Elder J P Haven from the Bluffs Also And A vary full House. I Addressed over one hour and had much of the Spirit of God resting upon me And bore A strong  testimony unto the People preached the first principles of the gosple And spoke of the general Bareings of the work of God  in the present Dispensation. In speaking of the body of Christ And members in particular I told them I had seen men in  my travels without Arms, legs, some without eyes, andc but I had  never seen A man going about without A head. And As A natu- ral body without A head would dye so the Church without ^a^ Head  would die.   Br Whipple followed me and made some vary good  remarks And edeyfying He said notwithstanding the Jews had Apostitized the right of the kingdom belonged to them and Jesus came and set up the kingdom  among them they rejected it He took the kingdom from the Jews gave it  to the Gentile all that were in the kingdom went to the gentiles with the  Kingdom of God. The Gentiles in like manner have Apostitized And have not continued in the goodness of God still they have A rightt to have the  kingdom of God set up among them in the last days And Joseph Smith  being warned and commanded of God has recieved the gospel from the hand  of an Angel, preached it to the gentiles set up the kingdom for the last time among them they have rejected it, it will now again be taken from them  and given to the Jews and all in the kingdom will go to the Jews with it and many will  come from E. W. N. S. and sidt down with Abram andc while the ^gentiles^ children of the Kingdom will be cast out   ENDENTRY Brother Haven followed with interesting remarks in explaining  the principles of repentance, by A figure. If A Mother set two little  children at work, they should leave it and go to play and dirty their clothes And when the Mother came she find they had not done the work but been disobediant but promised forgiveness if they would  go wash their face change their closes clothes and do the work one goes and  do as she is required the other follows her Mother and crys all day and  pleads with her to forgive her. When night comes one has cryed all day for fiorgiveness, but has not done the thing required the other  has done the things required, which is most justifyed the  one that obeyed the Mother. So with Man it is not evry one who says Lord, Lord, that shall enter into my Kingdom but He that  doeth the will of my father who is in Heaven.

He said General I see a light in the Parliament House, the General says I think it must be the Moon, King: No sir the Moon does not shine there. He then called six other Generals and two soldiers and order- ed them to accompany him to the Parliament House and they accompanied the king when they arived at the  House they saw it lighted with a large pair of Chandel- iers holding lighted Candles and as their had never  been any such thing in the house they were afrighted the king ordered one of the Generals to take the key  upon the door and go in and each one of the Generals in there turn fell upon there knees and said they would  rather die than go into the house the King then said I am your king I will lead the way you must follow so the king opened the door and the Generals and soldiers  followed him, they Passed through a long Hall whi- ch was hung in black in morning they went into  the Main Hall of the Parliament house, which was brilliantly lighted they there saw three tables two was occupied by two young men one sitting at each as recorders with Books upon the top of the other  sat a vary ancient old looking man, upon one side  of the Hall or room stood an exicutioner with an ax in his hand and a Block before him and 500 Nobleman  were crouded together like sheep in a pen, and when  the old man gave the word the executioner took one at a time and cut their heads off upon the block untill he had   ENDENTRY beheaded evry man and the blood coverd the floor more than ancle deep and run into the street, the king  understanding that it was an open vision and not a reality  asked the old man several times when the fulfillment of it would be the old man answered not the king then fell upon his knees and prayed the Lord to tell him  the fulfillment of the vision the old man then  spoke and said that it would not be in his day or the days of his children but it would be in the days  of the sixth or seventh king from him, then the  light went out the vision passed and all was darkness the king and Generals all went into the street shut the  Parliament house door returned to there homes and wrote the testimony to the world in their own language which remains in the libraries of Sweeden to this day, the  sixth King is now reigning and it is expected the  scene will soon take place as the king is now with the poor  and the Nobleman with against both king and People.   The second incident was a certain Hymn was herd sung  in three different Meeting Houses, in different parts of  sweeden, at the same hour of the night, by three seperate parties, and the account was published in three seperate News papers at the same day in different parts  of the kingdom, this was in the year AD 1837   rest of page blank ENDENTRY May 29, 1849 ~ Tuesday   29th FIGURES W.
