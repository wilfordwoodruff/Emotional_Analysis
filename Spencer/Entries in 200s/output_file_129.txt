 so to hear of the lightness of  his sentence. No wonder at the  rabid element getting more than  mad. We sincerely hope that they  will not be able to trump  up any other charge against  him, so as to retain him in  their power. For we feel with  you that he with the leaders   of Israel, are needed much to  labor in the midst of the  people and give unto the Saints  the word of the Lord, guiding  and directing them in the   path they ought to walk  How gladly the Saints will re-  ceive their words of council  and instruction after having been  for such a long time excluded  from their midst. We feel that 
 shillings (the price of a book) to five pounds and upwards,   and were entitled to receive copies without any fur-  ther payments, yet so great what is their joy, that   about eighty paid for their books five shillings each   saying that they had joy in so doing, as it was their   desire to assist in raising the balance yet due on the   final payment that there might be a fund on hand   for the publishing of other works, as they desire to   receive all that God has revealed for the guidance   and blessing of His children. When I was set   apart for this mission, among other great promises   and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was   that means necessary to carry on this work should   be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this   has been the case from the commencement until this   time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys-  terious manner, and as the payments have become   due just enough to pay them, has been forthcoming,   and for the last payment, the Saints have exceeded   our most sanguine hopes or expectations. With this   a statement will be furnished showing the receipt  and disbursements in balance on hand which I feel   will be most gratifying, for beside the balance of   £80-12-5, we have collected £18-3-6 for the sale of books   making a total of £98-15-11 so that all that is lacking   is about fifty pounds. 
 You will also be most gratified to note the in-  crease of souls during the past year. From statisti-  cal report inclosed you will see that 513 have been   baptized and 230 children blessed, making a total of 743   which is an increase of 237 over and above the year pre-  vious. There have also been two districts or conferences or-  ganized and fifteen branches, also ^22^ Sunday Schools; which   with the large sum of money raised for the printing of   the Book of Mormon, and that important work having   been nearly completed, we are filled with thanks giving   and praises unto the Lord our God; knowing as we do   know, that it has all been accomplished by His divine   guidance and wisdom, and as poor weak mortals we   do not desire to take the least praise unto ourselves; ful-  ly realizing that we have done no more than our duty.   But by His aid and blessings, we have sought to mgag-  nify our most high and holy callings as embassa-  dors of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and fully real-  ize that we have been wonderfully blessed and sustain-  ed, having enjoyed the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.    It is also most gratifying to us to be able to state   that the prospects for the future are very encouraging   indeed, and by the aid that we feel the Book of Mormon   will be in aiding in the spreading of the Word of God,   we feel that there will be a rich harvest of souls. Al-  ready there have ^been^ over one hundred added to the fold 
 we would gladly travel many  miles to have the blessed  privilege of seeing and hearing  the Apostles of Christ.    The Elders mentioned by you  arrived at Auckland on the 10th  inst in the enjoyment of health  having had a pleasant voyage  save the first day out from  San Francisco, which was quite  rough. Father Bromley looks quite  aged and feeble for such a long  journey. Yet he was feeling as  well as could be expected. They  were appointed to labor as fol-  lows: John H. Timpson, Waikato;  Latimus O. Taft, Poverty Bay;  Hugh S Geddes, Mahia;  Joseph P. Beck, Hawkes Bay;  We like their appearance much 
 and feel that they will make  good missionaries. Elder Geo  E. Woolley felt some what cast  down, on parting, with his  brethren to continue his journey  to Australia. Judging from the short  time I spent with him, I think  him a fine young man and  speak for him a useful life  through humility.    By some means the Elders  did not bring the tracts you  stated would be sent to us.  We sincerely hope they will come  by the Elders now on their  way here. It was very gratify-  ing to receive instructions concern-  ing the emigration of the "Maories"  For we have written three times  on the same subject without 
 since the date of the report.    The Elders are all quite well and enjoy a most   excellent spirit and are returning to their various   districts feeling that this has been by far the best con-  ference ever held in this mission. In their appoint-  ments and ^our^ council meetings, there was not a mur-  mur, or a dissenting voice, but all expressed them-  selves as feeling assured that the Lord had directed   in all things. Five of the six Elders that left in   March for this field of labor arrived in safety, were   in attendance at our conference, and have now   been assigned to their fields of labor. I like their ap-  pearance much, and think they are well adapted   for this mission. One of their number, Elder Geo.  T. Smith, returned from San Francisco on account of   poor health. While speaking of the Elders Iwill say   that we feel blessed in having such a good faith-  ful and obedient lot of boys, for such I call and   claim them to be.    Much might be said of our conference, the   large gathering, quantity of food consumed, kind-  ness of those not in the church, etc. but, as a full re-  port will be furnished the Deseret News I will not   take your valuable time by relating those items   here: will simply say that the weather and all per-  taining to the same was delightful. There was 
 nothing occurred to mar the peace and happiness of   those present; but felt that we were in the enjoyment   of the same Spirit that was with you in your con-  ference.    You will please send a remittance of nine-  ty pounds (£90)on the Union Bank of Australia   at Auckland for the return fares of Elders A. L.   Stewart now laboring in Australia, who has not   enjoyed the best of health during the two years he   has been here, and we do not think it best wise to keep   him here over another of the wet winters of Australia   as his lungs and kidneys seem affected. Alexander   Bullock, who has been here two years, a good faith-  ful man, over fifty years of age. He has not been   able to acquire the language, but has done all the   good that laid in his power. And H. J. Burgess who   has filled a faithful mission of 2 3/4 years. The   two first named will most likely return in May, with   a small company of Saints from Auckland. I will   borrow the means for them, unless you have kindly   responded to our last letter regarding the payment   for the Book of Mormon. If so that can be used.    We have also directed Elder Wm Bromley to return   home with Elder A. L. Stewart from Aust[ralia]. feeling that   it would not be best for him to remain here over   winter in his advanced age, he being over seventy 
 receiving any word until now. We  did not know what answer to  give to those so anxious to gather.  But now, we feel that they will  be quite reconciled for a time,  to wait until that suitable place  is selected for them. We will pre-  sent it to them in the best  light possible. We are sorry to  have to report another case of  hostility. This time it was with  the native Saints and not the Elders.  Yet it occured at the same  place that Elders Johnson and  Magleby were tied up and kept  prisoners for two days. The  chief and some of the leading  men at this village are very  bitter enemies to the Church.  And recently some of his people 
 years old. The understanding was that his brother,   whom he went to see, would pay his return fare;   but, not having heard from him I do not know   how it will be.    There continues to be quite an enquiry among   our dusky friends about their emigrating to Zion,   feeling that they desire to get to the land of their   forefathers where the Prophet and Apostles and the   holy temples are, &c. We tell them to be patient,   that this matter is before you, and in the due   time of the Lord, the word will come for them to   gather. This seems to satisfy them for a time, and   then like children they will spring the same question   again.    The hireling priest of the day, both European   and Native, are becoming quite alarmed about   us, the Elders, being in their midst: and at a   conference just held at the Bay of Islands, at   which there were three archbishops present, they   got up a petition with many signatures, and   sent to parliament asking for a law compell-  ing us to return, ^or leave the islands,^ and hindering any others from   coming: setting forth that we are destroying the   peace of the people; that before we came they   were united in religious matters, but now   we are causing them to leave the church of their 
 became convinced of the truth of  the Gospel and embranced the same.  This was done during a visit  to other parts. So when they  returned to their homes some of  the people, led on by the chief  and a hirelying priest, commenced   to affect them to endeavour to   get them to leave the church  Among other things they tied  brother and his wife up for  two days and nights. Also badly  whipped, knocked down and kicked  another brother and but for being  afraid of the laws of the lands  no doubt would have killed  them. The guilty parties were  summoned before Judge Booth  but did not receive their just   dues, as he, the Judge, is a 
 member of the Church of England  and a friend to the minister.  But on word being sent to Well-  ington, the Government seat, con-  cerning their proceedings we were  instructed to take the next case  to the higher court, with a  promise that we should receive  justice as they approved of our  labours among the natives. For  we are teaching them to keep  the laws of the land etc. We,  therefore, do not look for another  occurrence of that kind, at least  at the same place.    It is with hearts filled with  thanksgivings and praises unto our  Heavenly Father, that we report  to you the condition of this  important mission. For we realize 
 of the Book of Mormon by the first returning   Elders.    Having now sufficient Elders we have direct-  ed two from this conference, Elders N. S. Bishop and  Jos S. Groesbeck, to labor on the South Island, to endeav-  or to open up the work amoung the Maories of that is-  land. A native brother who has lived there has also  been appointed to accompany them.    All the Elders at the conference unite in send-  ing profound love and blessings, and ever praying  for the richest blessings of Heaven to be yours to enjoy,  that you may ever be fully adequate for every  circumstance which may arise, we remain  Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ.    Wm Paxman 
 that it is through the blessings  of God, and the ernest efforts of my  co-labourers, that we are enabled  to make such a favorable and  good report. In this the Bay of  Islands District, in which I am  now laboring and will be, the  Lord willing, for some time yet,  there has been one hundred and  twenty five added to the Church  during the past six weeks, and  the prospects are most encourag-  ing for many more to come   forth and enter into the Church  of Christ through the door of  baptism, in the near future.    Very favorable reports reach me  from all the Districts and more  or less are being added to the  Church. In Australia the Elders 
 meet with a great amount of  opposition to encounter. And there  seem to be very few that care  an iota about religion. They are  more lovers of pleasures than lovers  of God, their lives being the  riches of the world. Still the  Elders labors with great diligence  and are doing all that lies  in their power to warn the  people. Sister Armstrong and  family of five children, emigrated  by the last mail steamer from  that place. This makes it still  worse for the Elders, as that was  their best and almost only  home. We have had five thous-  and tracts printed entitled, "Good  tidings or the New and Everlasting  Gospel" by Jos. F. Smith for 
 that part and the Europeans upon  these Islands. So with the tracts  you are sending us we will be  better prepared to warn the people  and find the few honest in heart    The health of the Elders is good,  as far as I now know. And  there is general goods health  prevailing among the Saints.  As was expected Elders H. J. Man  ning and M. S. Marriott wife and child  and Sister Katie left for home by  the last mail steamer, as also   a young sister, Charlotte Rowntree,  and the six mentioned from   Sydney. Elder Manning was ap-  pointed to take charge of the  company. They return with Hon  -orable Releases having performed  faithful missions 
 Te Hauke, Hawks Bay  New Zealand,  July 3, 1888    President Wilford Woodruff  and Quorum of Apostles;    Dear and beloved Brethren:  Once more through the loving kindness of our Heaven-  ly Father we are permitted to address you by letter, in  answer to your most welcome and highly appreciated fa-  vor of the 24th of May, which reached us on the 30th of  June, since which time it has been read and re-read   with increased interest and joy, for we need not state  that our hearts were made to swell within us with rejoic-  ings, and praises unto the Lord our God to know that  another Temple had been dedicated unto the Most high  God, and made holy by His presence and acceptance,   and by the rich out pouring of His Holy Spirit to  fill every part thereof—even to the rejoicing of all that  were permitted to enter its sacred portals, many of whom,   I feel assured, heard and saw the marked manifestations  of Gods approval and acceptance of so beautiful an  offering from His covenant children. Your discription  of its elegance and beauty of finish, making it so grand  and pleasing to the eye, was very gratifying indeed.    We could not helpp feeling in our hearts, Oh, that we  might have been present to have partaken of those  blessed privilages, yet, feeling at the same time, that 
 As we may not be able to write  to you for some time, and in  order to give you time, will  here state, that we would like  to have four or five Elders for  this Mission arrive in Auckland  in March next. The steamer  will leave San Francisco about  the 8th of March.    Elders J. E. Magleby and J. W. Kau-  leinamoku, have now been here  about three years and four months  Therefore it will be right for  them to return home in early  Spring. They have filled most ex-  cellent missions. So please send  the means for their return fares  on the Union Bank of Australia  at Auckland.    We were much gratified to 
 we are just where Father wants us to be; therefore we are  reconciled to labor with our might to bless this branch  of the house of Israel. And we unite with you in the  prayer that the Mighty One will ever preserve it from  the hands of the wicked and the defilement of the unclean,   that it may continue a house holy unto the Lord, in   which the Saints may receive their blessings, & labor for  the redemption of their dead.    Surely this will be an aditional strength to the Saints,   in which we will have greater power with the heavens;  God grant that it may be so.    How rejoiced we were to learn of your brief stay  in Juab Stake, and that we had a son that was worthy  of your confidence and had the privilage of an inter-  view with you; we had expressed a wish that you might  have the privilage of dedicating the Temple before  it was open to the public.    The account given of the actions of the Receiver is  not so pleasing; they produce feelings of another kind  for we see in his actions the strong determination of  Satan to destroy the church of Christ, and afflict in  every possible way the saints of the Most High, and  feel if he can stop the glorious labor that is now being  done in the Holy Temples, he will have gained a great   victory.  Earnest prayers are being offered up in this the  nethermost part of the earth, for the Lord to preserve those  holy buildings from falling into the hands of our enemies  yet, at the same time we fully realize that all is in 
 the hands of the Lord, and that he will control all things  for the best, for, as you sayo beautifully say, come what   will, it will not destroy the fact of revelation or the  Gospel being restored, and if we are faithful to them no  power can seperate us from the love of our Lord and  Master Jesus Christ.    By the same mail that brought your letter we learn  with deep regret of the death of our beloved brother Apostle  Erastes Snow. Another noble spirit has gone to join with  our illustrious prophets, apostles, patriarchs, and saints  that have gone before, to intercede with the heavenly hosts  in the behalf of the saints left behind.    The seven Elders mentioned by you, arrived at Auckland  in safety on the 23 of June, feeling well in spirits, and have  been assigned to their fields of labor as follows:   Jas. S. Nye, Hawks Bay; R. Gibbons, Poverty Bay;   Walter S. Reid, Bay of Islands; Jos. S. Dame, Waikoto;   Jos. N. Haywood, Mahia; John S. Bingham, Waiapi;  and Thos. C. Young, Hauraka districts, the last three to  teach school, and in a short time Elder Reid will  also teach school in the Bay of Islands.    In relation to our day-schools, we will here state that we  are careful not to organize them, only in such parts where  there are no Government schools within reach of the child-  dren, and where there are a number of children growing up in  ignorance, for we see it will be a labor to keep them up;  however, it affords the Elders this teaching, an opportunity  of acquiring the language, and fitting them for the 
 learn of the success of the  work of the Lord upon the  Samoan Islands and trust that  the interest may continue.    Also very thankful to know that  the new judges are acting with  more justice and consideration to-  wards the Saints. And do sin-  cerely trust that the same  spirit may continue to be mani-  fested. We learn from the papers  that the Supreme Court of the  Territory has decided against us  in the property suit. That is as  good as we could naturally expect  from that body. But we sincerely  hope that that ^the^ Supreme Court of the   U States may have eyes to see and  ears to hear, that justice may be  done. We are well in health 
 missionary field, for as a general thing an education  aids much in acquiring the language: where ever the  schools have been started we find the children very  quick toin learning.    We are also organizing Sunday Schools in all the  branches where we have sufficient children, and can  find suitable material for the officers; quite an interest  is manifested in the same, by old and young, and we  feel they will be the means of doing much good.    In the coming fall it will be time for the follow-  ing named Elders to be released to return home, viz.  Sandra Sanders Jr, it being now three years since he  left home, H. J. Manning, and M. S. Marriott and  Sister Georgena Marriott, as it will make three years  for them by that time, they have all filled most ex-  cellant missions, doing all that layed in their power to  aid in the saving of souls, and the warning of the people  of the great and terrible day of the Lord. Elder Sanders  has labored faithfully for upwards of a year upon the  translation of the Book of Mormon. Please send the  draft for their return fares, on the Union Bank of  Auckland ^Australia^, at Auckland    Elders J. E. Magleby and J. W. Kauleinamoko came here  at the same time as Elder Sanders, but as we meed them  to assist in the opening up of new districts, being short  of Maori linguists, they are willing to remain until  spring.    We would be most pleased to have (6) six 
 and feeling splendid in our labors  and desire to do all that lies  in our power to further the pur-  poses of God on this part of  God's vineyard. The printing of the  Book of Mormon is progressing nicely.  We desire to have it completed by  our April Conference. Though the  means is coming in rather slowly  at present.    Ever praying for the choicest  blessings of God our Eternal Father  to be yours. That you may be  adaquate to every emergency  With profound and sincere love in  Which Elders Geo Romney Jr. and  E. Mangleby, who I am now with,  join. I am now as ever    Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ.  Wm Paxman 
 Elders for this mission, if it could be arranged for  them to leave San Francisco by the steamer that sails  from there on the 17 of October. I could meet them   on their arrival at Auckland, as, the Lord willing,   I will be there at that time on my way to the Bay of  Islands, the extreme north end of the Island: if  two or three of that number had an aptitude to teach  school we would be thankful.    We are now extending our labors more among the Eu-  ropeans, than we have done before, and by the blessings  of the Lord there has been quite a few baptized, but we  labor unde[r] a disadvantage in not having a suply of tracts  for them, and, having the publishing of Book of Mormon on  hand, we dare not ask for means out side of that. The  Tithing that comes in is but very small, hardly suffic-  ient to meet the small current expenses. If some of  our brethren that have made fortunes in a day, by selling  their inheritences, could be induced to send out a few thous-  and tracts, treating on the first principles of the Gospel  etc., we could make excellant use of them, and they would  thereby be preaching the Gospel by the printed word; the  tracts could be sent by the coming Elders without any  expense.    Since our last letter to you, gratifying words have  reached us from the Mahia, Hauraka and Bay of Island   districts of the aditions to the Church by baptism, there  have also been aditions in this the Hawks Bay district of  both Europeans & natives, and the prospects for the fu- 
 c/o James Hay,  Cobden Street  Newton, Auckland,  New Zealand.  May 8th 1889    President Wilford Woodruff.    Dear and much beloved Brother.    We are just in receipt of your most esteemed favor  of the 1st of April, which was read and reread with  deep interes,.  And we feel greatly blest to receive  so much of your attention and kind consideration, and  was indeed blest in our feelings to learn of the good  health of yourself and those of the Apostles. As also to  learn of the prosperety and welfare of Zion in all  of her department. It was most gratifying to  learn of the grand success of the Church Schools now  organized, as also of the bright prospects of others  being started in the near future.    We feel assured that you had a glorious time during  your conference, and we sincerely hope that  among the "important items of buisness transadid"  that the First Presidency was organized, as we  feel that the Church is much stronger with all  her quorums fully organized, and how blest  we as saints are, for your life having been  preserved upon the earth to direct the affairs  of God upon His foot stool, having been so  familiar with the Church of Christ from 
 the beginning, Surely the Lord has had a  purpose in thus preserving you with all your  mental and physicial faculties to such a ripe  age.  And may God's choice blessings ever be  with you and those associated with you, is the  many earnest prayers that are offered up by  our dusky friends, as also the Elders.    We with you sincerely desire that our en-  emies will not prevail with Prest Harrison  in getting our most bitter enemies appoin-  ted to fill the various offices of the Territory.    We are indeed verry grateful for your kin-  dness in loaning the $500, asked for, that  we might be able to meet our obligations  incured in the printing of the 2,000 copies  of the Book of Mormon in Maori: and feel  exceedingly thankful for the same.    And we are truly happy to be able to state  that we are in a possition so that we will  not need to use more then $200 of the  amount sent, as we stated in our letter  sent to you by the last mail. So if you  have not sent the £90 - asked for, on the  recept of this, please do not send only  £30 and credit us with the $300, and the  Lord willing it will be but a short time  before we will be able to refund the  remaining $200, as the Natives are 
 future look fully as favorable as at any time in the  past; for, although the ministers of the various churches  are doing all that lay in their power against the work of  God among our dusky friends, calling their chiefs together  to poisen their minds etc., they do not succeed as they would  like, for they generally find some of our Elders or Saints to  rebut their statements and stand up in our favor, giving the   natives a chance to see the differance between p Priesthood  and Priestcraft, and in many cases doing more good than  harm, for they overstep all bounds of reason, and tell  such barefaced falshoods that even the natives can de-  tect them.    On my return from the South, I found Elder S. Sanders  and Sister Katie in the enjoyment of health, and about fin-  ishing the writing of the MSS, ready for the reading before  our Maori brethren, as soon as they can get there.    Elder Marriott wrote me a few days ago asking if  there would be any objections of one of our Native Sisters  emigrating to Zion, the only objection I see in the way  is, that others will desire to follow in the same way, for  it will not do to extend to one any liberties that cannot be  given to all as they are so peculiar in this respect, so much  like children we have to be exceedingly careful in every  movement we make with them, and with their limited  experience in the Gospel, and their natural desire to im-  itate after the evils. Fears are entertained by us that  some of them might partake of the bad element of  our once peaceful cities and report back the amount 
 anxious to get the books to read, and in a  few days we will have another 500 copies  ready for sale.  We have indeed been  blest in this labor.    Now dear President, regarding  your enquiries.  "Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now with  you whom you can recommend to succeed you  when you are released to return home, or do you  think it will be necessary or desirable that some  Elder specially called to preside in Australasia be  sent from here?"  We will here state, that  we have two Elders that in my judgment  would be suitable to fill this possition, namely  Angus. T. Wright of Ogden, who has been here  1 1/2 years.  And J. S. Bingham of Clifton, Ida-  ho, who is a counciler to the Bishop of that  Ward, he has been here one year the 23rd of  next month, they are both good men, and wou-  ld do all that laid in their power to further  the work of God in this land.  I fear how-  ever that the first named would not be  able to endure so much horse back riding  as is required of the president of this mission,  as he is enclined to be stout and riding to  much on horse back seem to hurt him.    At our anual conference, last month,  they were both appointed to preside over  verry important districts, those that had 
 of wrong doing there is in the midst of the saints,   such as drinking, smoking, swearing, Sabbath-  breaking etc., which would spread from one end of  the Island to the other, thereby doing much harm.    It might be well to here state that our dusky friends  are exceedingly fond of all sports and ammusements, such   as horse races, billiards, foot ball, foot-races, etc., and  it would not require but a small exertion on their part  to follow after all such things. Our feelings are that  when they emigrate, there should be a suitable location  for them to gather to, that they might be together, as all  their work now is done on the United order principle;  they will not work, live, eat or sleep alone, and they are  not ever fond of work, but if properly directed they can  do a great deal of work. Having thus given our feelings in  brief, we will be pleased to receive and carry out any  suggestions or instructions you may deem best to give  on this matter.    There is general good health prevailing in the midst of  the saints, there has been no time since our arrival here  that the saints have been so free from sickness.   The health of the E[l]ders and Sisters is also good, for which  we feel exceedingly thankful to our Heavenly Father.    We were rejoiced to learn of your good health and  have a great desire that it may so continue, for we  see to a limited extent the great labors that are upon  you in these very trying times as also the intense  anxiety. Earnest, yet humble prayers are con 
 been somewhat neglected for the want  of suitable Elders to preside over them.  And if eith-  er of them were called, we would not know  just how to fill up the vacency and do justice  to the district, yet, if you are led to appoint  one of them we could get along some how,  but, if a good wise fatherly Elder could  be sent from home, it might be good, as  it would give him a longer time to  preside, and leave these districts mentioned  in a better condition.    This mission is quite large and is still  growing.  It now take about a year to  go over the same, attending conferences,  etc.   We have a great desire, and feel  sure that the ^right^ one will be appointed, for  this is a verry peculiar people to handle,  and by the blessings of the Lord we now have  their love and confidance.    Elder A. L. Stewart, will return home with  a small company of European saints, by  the steamer that bring this to you, he is  a good faithful worker and have prefor-  med a good mission of two years; the  last one being in Australia.    With him I will send copies of the  Book of Mormon in Mauri for yourself  and Prests George Q Cannon and Jos. F. Smith. 
 stantly assending unto the Lord our God from  the Elders and Saints. Many times our hearts  are made glad at listening to the earnest appeals  to the Throne of Grace, made by our dusky breth-  ren and Sisters, and we feel that the Lord will hear  them, because of their child like simplicity.

 realiazing that you would like to see them,  and prehaps may come in useful for  some of your sons.    Since receiving your letter we have  made arrangements for holding conferences  in five of the districts, which will  occopy my time untill the last of July.    Since the last writing there has been  quite a few added to the Church by  baptism, and the future look quite  bright before us.    We are quite anxious to receive the con-  ference news that we may be kept  posted, and be strengthened there by.    As we wrote you at length a month ago;  we will not add more at this time, only  to say that the health of my self and colabor-  ers is good, and our spirits cheerful and  bright. The health of the saints is also  generally good.

 two of our clerks have left us; Bro. Grimshaw cannot stand  Mormonism any longer—or the hard times, and he has left for   England on his own hook, and Bro Bullock has been called  by President Young to go on a Mission to England, so there   are none now, but Leo, Robert and myself, but we shall do the   best we can. We have got through with the history of Joseph up   to his death, unless you give us something more in answer to   the letter we sent you by the last mail, to fill up some blanks &c.   We shall next commence upon the History of Brigham Young &c.    There is nothing very strange with us, all is peace and quietness   with us while the strom is raging in the lower world, the only thing we   have heard of late to create any excitement at all, and that but little   was that Troskalawski one of the U. S. Surveying party had been   damning the people and boys, and calling them, in the streets anything  he could think of. One evening while calling the two Mechams  "God damned Mormon sons of Bitches" they pitched him down  into the ditch and gave him a thrashing, and it has been said  that Gen. Burr was going to leave in consquence of it but it  has not made much stir.    Your family are well, as is the case with the families of   all the brethren who are there. We are going a head with the   Agricultural and Manufacturing interest; the Hands are  taking the matter up, in this city, and becoming Auxiliary  branches of the Society, and are going into the Manufacturing   business as far as possible, we have it to do, as the money   is nearly all gone out of the Territory. There is a general   council and feeling through this Territory to retrench our  expenses at the Stores and make all that we have to use, as far  as we can. 
 President Young is extending his high stone wall around   all around his Mansion and garden. President Kimball  has built a fine granary with cobble stones laid in cement  and his extending his wall all around his premises.    The New Historians Office is progressing finely; the   plasterers last night finished their work on it, it will   soon be ready for us to go into.    I hope we shall hear from you often.    We wish to be remembered to you.    As Ever, I remain  Yours truly,   W Woodruff 
 Br Woodruff said that his health was not good said  that the Lord saw that the longer we remained in sin  the harder it would be for us to get rid of our sins, we  would never find as good A time to get rid of our sins  as the present said that we could not hide them  from the Lord and that we should confess and  [adore] and spoke on the subject of the Gentiles that  are in our midst that he did not care much about   them and gave some good instruction.

My Dearly beloved Bretheren:    Your ever welcome letter   of Jany 8th came duly to hand and   as usual we were much pleased   to receive your valued instruc-  tions, and feel to press forward   with renewed dilligence after pe-  rusing the same.    We fully realize the great   responsibility resting upon you   during these very peculiar and   distressing times, but know that   God is able to make you equal to   every emergency. We have eager-  ly scanned the newspapers on   the arrival of our mails to learn   if possible the decision on pend-  ing cases. We really have no fear 
 servants and highly favored   mouth pieces.    I am pleased to report   that five Elders reached  here in safety, enjoying good   health, and having had   a very pleasant voyage.  One of them, Bro. A. L.   Young was selected to con-  tinue on to Australia, to   labor under the direction of   Elder Geo E. Woolly who   now has charge of that field   of labor. The balance of   the company were appointed   to various fields on this   Island.    While on this subject I wish   to enquire what to do in the   case of Bro. William Bromley,  who is now laboring in 
 for the final outcome of the cause   of God, but we certainly would   like to see our rights respected   more, and ^the^ spirit of the law ad-  ministered with more equity   and justice.    We are now anxioulsly a  waiting to hear the results of the   City election.    Having had an unpleasant   experience with our unscrupu-  lous opponents we cannot help   having grave fears that they   may have worked their nefar-  ious schemes there and gained   the day.    We enclose with this the six   months report, also one for the   past year and trust they will   reach you in time for the general   conference.    As our labors and conferences

I was informed that the   mission was his own   choice, and got the impres-  sion that he would return   at his pleasure, and con-  sequently, with his own   means. When I met Pres.

Our re-  ports will show how the cause is   moving. While they are not com  ing in so fast as formally, yet   those who receive the Truth now,   have considered longer, under-  stand its requirements better,   and should be stronger to with-  stand the weaknesses of the flesh   to which they in particular seem   subject.

 better off among friends at   home.    There will probably be no   Elders returning though   before October, and I don't   think it advisable for the   old gentleman to undertake   the journey alone. There is   a prospect of having another   small company of emigrating   Saints by that time.    In your latest communi-  cation, you speak as though   there may be some elders   following. I will be very   glad indeed to get them, or   at least two more which   will make up the number   I asked for, and fill existing   vacancies.    I find it ne^ce^ssary to keep

 up the full compliment of   Elders, in order to have qualified   speakers to take charge of dis-  tricts.    In my communication of   March 19th, I recommended   that four new Elders be   notifed forto this field to arrive   here in Sept., or Oct. Please   notify five instead of four,  to reach here at the time   stated.    We have started again   on our tour of inspection or   visits among the various   districts of the mission, and   thus far have found the   Saints feeling well in the   Gospel, and no more than   the usual amount of   troubles to settle. 
 As the winter rains have   begun, and earlier too than   usual, traveling is made   disagreeable and in some   parts impossible on account   of the heavy floods which   are quite common to the   country.    We continue to enjoy   good health, as do all of   the Elders, and nothing   more serious than an occasional   attack of the Gripps, or slight   cold has troubled any of us   for some time. Were we   not satisfied that the prayers   of our dear ones and the   Saints generally are heard   by our Heavenly Father  and that we are preserved   by Him, it would seem 
 almost miraculous the way   in which we are enable   to stand the inconveniences   of the Mission and the   changeableness of this climate.    Praying for the success   of Zion and the health   and prosperity of her inspired   leaders, I am your obedient   servant,    Angus T. Wright.    Address;  c/o E.

 dear and delicate sisters.  I was as much suprized  as I was pained to hear of  the accusation against brother  Taft, for I had labored with ed  him for some months, and had  not only formed an attachment  for him, but always considered  him a faithful and energetic  young man. I received a  telegram from him the same  day I did your letter, stating  he had trouble at home would  leave on first steamer and  inqired about money for his   passage, as I could not follow  your instructions implicitly,  to have him come to see me -  on account of distance and  lack of time, I wired him 
 telling him you had reported  his case to me and if he  was guilty I was to send  him home. He answerd  back that he is guilty, or  to use his own words, that  the report is correct, and he  would leave the next day for  Auckland I directed a letter  containing a check for 25 pou-  nds, to him, at Auckland, stat-  ing also that I had no aut-  hority to pay the fares of   Elders returning under such  circumstance that he must  arrange that matter with you.

My Dearly Beloved Bretheren:    We were very much pleased   indeed to receive your kind and   interesting epistle of the 11 ult.  and will endeavor to put your   [v]aluable instructions into prac-  tice.    We can fully indorse your   remarks in which you say that   opposition is preferable to apathy,   having recently experienced the   former, and in consequence had   several European additions in   a part where a minister had been   lecturing against us.    We are pleased to hear that   we may expect two more mis- 
 be adviseable to notify at least  four new Elders to take their  places, to reach here in Sept.  or October.    I feel impressed to make  a few suggestions in regard  to my successor and yet I  hesitate to do so least you   should think I am seeking  a release for myself; I assure  you such is not the case for  I am enjoying my labors   and am perfectly willing  to remain here and do all  I can in my weak way for  the advansement of the cause  of God, till He is satisfied  and His servants say it is   enough: what I wish to say  is that when the time comes 
 could in a written communi-  cation. I will just say that   our district, and the annual   conferences were all that we   could expect, and were in ev-  ery way successful.    We continue to have   an occasional European con-  vert, and the Elders could use   some European tracts to very   good advantage, if you would   kindly favor us again by send-  ing another lot of them.    As Elder Stevenson   had intended returning by   Europe, but having changed   his mind, he has a surplus   of money; and not caring to   carry so much across with   him, has deposited fifty (50) 
 sionaries at as early a date as   March, for the work continues to   grow, new fields are opening,   and additional Elders will be   needed. The five Elders which   I wrote for last mail, please   send as soon as convenient, in   addition to the two sailing in   March.    Your instructions concern-  ing the general fast day were   received, but not till after the   day appointed had passed. We   however, realizing also the benefit   of prayer, set apart one of the   days of our conference when we   fasted and offered our feeble   supplications to the Throne of   Grace in behalf of Zion gener-  ally, and her leaders in par-  ticular. It was a day of rejoic- 
 I think it advisable to send  some one well versed in  the principles of the Gospel; of  good judgment, and a man  of experience in presiding or  sitting in judgment on diff-  icultys arising among memb-  ers of the Church.    Owing to their peculiar marr-  iage relations their weaknesses  and great adaptability to  follow after the sins and follies  of their wicked European nei-  ghbors, curious and compli-  cated cases arise which, as   one Elder said, would take  the patience of Job and the  wisdom of Solomon to settle,   as the Elders here are all  young men and before 
 ing to us, for the spirit of God   was in our midst and we felt   assured that our Father would   hear and answer our prayers.    We mail a report of our   interesting conference to the News.   Truly we had a time of rejoicing   and we have not experienced a   richer flow of the spirit of testi-  mony since we have had the   pleasure of laboring among this   peculiar people. Many of the   Elders have also been unusually   blessed in acquiring the language,   one in particular, who bore his   testimony quite intelligently in   the native tongue after a residence   of but four weeks among them.   The manifestations which we   are almost daily receiving are a   source of great consolation to us,

If you will   kindly order the equivalent of   this amount paid to him there,   you will favor me very much.    I am pleased to say   that the Elders are all well, and   laboring dilligently for the salva-  tion of souls.    I will not add more   at present, as Bro Stevenson   will tell you the news.    The two Elders who   were expected last month did   not arrive. I hope there will   be some on this boat as they are   much needed. 
 coming are usualy without  experience, they would natura-  lly feel more confident to have  an experienced head to look  to and receive counsel from.   I submit these suggestions  becaus I realize this is a  large, important, and very  expensive mission; beleiving  that its future success depe-  nds largely on the capabilities  and influence of the presiding  officer, and also through my  great desire to see it continue  to grow and prosper.    Our yearly Conference will  convene April 4th, at which   we anticipate a large turn-  out and a good profitable  time; preparation's are being 
 and we know that God is with us  in our labors among this people.    Elder Wagstaff of whom we  wrote as ailing, is now reported  by his president as being complete-  ly restored to health through the  administrations and prayers  of the Elders in his behalf.    Please excuse this short note  as we are pupon a trip of about  one thousand miles on horseback,  and our time is very much lim-  ited. Am pleased to say that we  are all quite well in health and  rejoicing in spirit, and unite in  sending love and many blessings  to all of our dear leaders in Zion.    Yours faithfully,  A T.

 made on a large scale,   I will select one of the Elders  to go to Australia as a com-  panion for Brother Woolly, as  I do not think it would be  wise to leave him there  alone in that dark and  wicked part of the mission.   we are anxiously awaiting  our next mail to learn the  result of the Election in your  fair City, but from the tone  of your letter added to our for-  mer fears and feeling, we  can prepare for the worst  ^and are^ ready to score the arch enemy  another victory and say that  one more scene in the great  drama of spoliation has been and ended,  we are all well with the 
 exception of one or two of the  Elders who are suffering from  colds contracted in this  trying climate.    I wish to ask a question  with regard to Half Caster.  There are some here in  the Church, who are quite  light complected, who speak  english fluently, have Euro-  peans dress, manners, cust-  oms, in fact have lived  among the Europeans most  of the time -- Should any  of this class desire to emi-  grate what would be your  counsel in the matter.

President Wilford Woodruff and  Brethren of the Council,    My Dearly Beloved Leaders:    I again take pleasure in addressing a few words to you, to  report our condition and requirements in this remote part  of the Lords Vineyard. I am pleased to state first that  Elders. Thos. C. Stanford, P. P. Thomas, L. J. Hawkes, M. Bennion, and O. C.  Dunford and wife arrived safely and in good health and  spirits, by the last mail boat having had a pleasant and  comparatively smooth passage. While on this subject, I  will say that I think it would be best to discourage the  Elders from bringing their wives with them to this field  of labor, for really it is not a suitable place, nor have we  proper accommodations for our sisters.    I was somewhat surprised at not getting notice  from you of their coming, nor even a letter with them,  and it was only by chance that I heard of their coming  and averted what might have been quite an inconvenience  to them, as it is almost absolutely necessary for some one to  meet them here to assist them in making necessary pur-  chases. etc    Will you be kind enough to send me about five more  new Elders for this field, to fill the places of those which 
 ition to the purposes of God, and  as his time is drawing nigh  can we expect him to relax  his efforts? We feel to say am-  en to your testimonies regarding  the final result of the work of  God.    We thank the Lord that the saints  are once more privileged to listen  to your inspired concsels, and  know they appreciate them as  we shall do when once more al-  lowed that great blessing. We  feel to rejoice to know that we  are remembered in your sup-  plications to the throne of our  Maker, and can assure you  that fervent prayers are daily  offered by the Elders and saints  in this far off land, for your  continued peace, health and  general prosperity. 
 will be released in April. If they could come on the  boat which leaves San Francisco about April 5th, it would  be most convenient; if that is too short notice, please send  by boat leaving second or third of May.    If you will kindly notify me a mail in advance I  will appreciate it very much. I would like to have  at least two of them qualified for school teaching, and  if I may be permitted to suggest, I would say, that  when selecting Elders for this field it would be well  to remember that they have a new and difficult language  to learn, and all books issued as helps to the learner, are  on a grammatical basis, and therefore Elders who have  no knowledge of grammar, find the study very irksome  and the acquiring of the language almost impossible,  consequently very discouraging to themselves and the  native saints who are expected to provide for them.    The Lord has wonderfully blessed many of us, in  our comparative ignorance of our own tongue, "But  all have not the same gifts, though directed by the same spirit" [##Doctrine and Covenants 46:11##] [##1 Corinthians 12:4##]    With regard to the Australian part of our field of  labor we have but two there whom we can depend  upon as laboring Elders, the third one (Brother Bromley)  is visiting relatives, and as one of them, Brother Chip-  man, will be released in April, it will perhaps be  necessary to send some elders there. That is if it is  intended to continue the mission. I suppose though 
 Since my appointment to the   high and responsible position as  President of this mission, a  calling which I by no means  feel capable of magnifying, I have  been attending conferences and  laboring among the outsiders in  the extreme Northpart of the  Island.    I am sorry to say that our   labors were not crowned with  much success, owing princi-  pally to the united and persist-  ant efforts of the clergy. They  are continually warning the  people against us, and in so-  me withplaces we could with  difficulty get places to sleep,  and having in many instances,  the doors closed in our faces.    The Maories are naturally a  hospitable people, but the lies 
 that President Paxman has reported its conditions, and  suggested to you its requirements.    From a recent letter received from Elder Chipman,  he represents the people as being very indifferent, and  that after thoroughly advertising in daily papers, post-  ing circulars etc., that but perhaps three or four strangers  would come to their hall, and it reminded us  forcibly of our late experience in trying to interest the  Europeans of Auckland and suburbs. He reports  but one baptism in the past three months.  I am pleased to report that the work progresses favor-  ably in this part of the mission, though we have  many things to contend with, the natives being so  weak, and we are occasionally obliged to take action  against members for their persistent evil practices,  and particularly for their running after the Moari  priests, or workers in witchcraft and Moari superstitions    We recently visited a small neighboring island and  God so blessed us that we were permitted to add 52  souls to the fold. We were met and opposed by satan  who took possession of one of the females there, but  by the power of the priesthood of God, and in the  name of his Son, he was cast out, the afflicted person  baptised, and we all rejoiced in the great testimony  which was given to us.    From our home papers we learn of the excellent

They were perused  with much pleasure and interest  by us and we will strive to  carry out the instructions there-  in.    We have written Prest.  Woolley with regard to Elder  Bromley's circumstances;    He reports that the relatives  on ^w^hom he was depending for  return fare etc., have rejected  his testimony, turned him 
 told them be their ministers,  augmented by the espressed  hatred of the European living  here towards us, has poisoned  them to such an extent that  Maoriesmany will not listen, but  we made some friends, and  are in hopes that some of the  seen sown has fallen upon  good ground.    Owing also to this same op-  position which is prompted by  the father of lies, and who has  always been fighting against  Light and Truth, we find the  books of Mormon very slow sale  among them, and from the pre-  sent outlook it will take some  time to pay off the indebtedness  of some £35—We are persever-  ing however and hope by the  blessings of the Lord to be able 
 from their homes and he is  now laboring for his food.    Bro. Woolley reports the  old gentleman as saying that   "he has no means and that  if he returned home the church  would have to pay his fares."    Pleased to hear that we   are soon to be reinforced with   new elders and will make it  a point to meet them in Auck-  land, to welcome them to  maoridom. One of them  will probably be sent on to  Australia    While on this subject  we will suggest that it would  be perhaps advisable to instruct  elders when coming here to  buy their tickets to Australia,  instead of Auckland, as 
 conference which was enjoyed by yourselves, and so much  appreciated by the saints in Zion generally; and it  makes our souls long for the time when we can again  assemble with the saints and enjoy the outpourings  of the Holy Spirit, as I well believe it was in your  late conference    We were pleased also to learn that the quorum of  the Twelve was filled, and from our personal know-  ledge of the majority of the Brethren selected for  that high and important calling, can say it was an  inspired selection, and we all can, and do, support  them with our faith and prayers.    May God bless you all and inspire you contin-  ually is the prayer of your humble servant,    A. T. Wright.    P.S    Our note which we made to complete last payment  on the Book of Mormon for £25, will soon be due, and the books  not being as ready sale as was anticipated, we are unable to  meet it; If you will kindly loan us £33-0-0, it will releive  our embarrassment at the bank, and will also allow me  to pay bro Charles Hardy a balance of 8£ due him from a sum  borrowed for the same purpose. Bro Geo Romney Junr understands  the circumstances & our position & will explain if necessary.

 the fares are the same from  San Francisco, and in case  one or more should be wanted  for the Australian field it  would avoid the fares from  Auckland there, which are   five pounds.    I was made very  happy by receiving my release,  not entirely because I could  return to my home and friends,  but I also realized that I  had about completed a mis-  sion of three years and to know  that I had been preserved  from the sins of this untoward  generation truly made my  heart rejoice.    I will fill all appoint-  ments made, and sail Oct 6th,  with the company of returning 
 elders.    I was also much pleased  with the successor named by  you and feel that he is the  proper person and will be  sustained by the saints.    As I was in his com-  pany when I received your  letter, and will be for another  month, I will have ample  timeopportunity, and will cheer-  fully give him all the in-  formation I possess on  the condition of the mission,  and will transfer all books  monies etc, as you request.

Smith    My Dearly beloved Brethren:    Your ever welcome letter of 28th ult. came  duly to hand, and we were very much pleased  to hear from you again, and fully appreciate  your kindness in devoting so much of your  valuable time in favoring us so often.    I pleased to learn that brother Taft  had had so much clemency shown him  and that there is an opportunity offered  for such unfortunates to repent and again  be restored to fellowship. I really feel,  from my acquaintance and associations with  him, that he will fully appreciate and duly  merit the salvation which is now offered  him through his repentance.    I was pleased also to learn that two   more Elders were on their way to this field of  labor; I will have one of the brethren meet  and welcome them to Maoridom.    There was one question I asked  in my communication of March 19th, in  regard to half-caste Maories emigrating 
 sustained by us, and we  will take pleasure in labor-  ing in accordance with your  requests.    We are very sorry  to report that it becomes nec-  essary to release another  elder on account of ill health;  Bro. Jno. H. Timpson, of  the 16th ward Salt Lake City,  is the unfortunate one.    He has been in the field  nearly two years and has  suffered quite severely most  of the time with a peculiar  rumbling noise and distress-  ing pain in his head, caus-  ing deafness which in con  nection with bronchial troubles  has incapacitated him for  his labors. 
 He, in connection with others  of the elders, has exercised  much faith, administered  to ordinances, but without  the desired effect.    He has been  cheerful through all his afflic  tions and will leave many  warm friends behind among  the maori saints. I will  arrange about his return fare  when I see you.    I have no Rail-  way half-fare permits. If  you can procure them for  us, we would appreciate the  kindness very much.    Please mail them,  or any instructions, to me  care of Grand Hotel, San   Francisco. 
 to Zion, which apparently was overlooked,  as your answer contains no mention  of it. I would like very much to have  your mind on the subject, as there are one  or two who are talking seriously of making  an effort to get out of Babylon, and to gather  with the saints in Zion.    The following Elders will be released  to sail October 6th:    Charles Johnson, Jr. Grantsville,  Joseph T. Waldron, Richville Morgan Co.,  John T. Smellie, Rexburg, Idaho.  Joseph J. Jackson, American Fork Utah Co.    These brethren have been faithful labor-  ers, and will have been nearly three years  in the field. I think it advisable to release  brother William Bromley, from Charleston  Wahsatch Co., also, who will have been in   Australia nearly two years. I have  previously written you however in regard  to his case, and therefore leave him in  your hands.    Please order a draft made in my  favor, on the Union Bank of Australia,  Auckland, for sufficient amount to allow  the returning Elders the usual 30£ each, less 
 Te Aroha, N. Z.   June 9th [18]90    President Wilford Woodruff   and Counsellors,    My Dearly Beloved Leaders:    I am sorry to have   to report to you, that   the bearer of this note,   Brother Heber J. Wagstaff,   who has been suffering   for some time with asthma   and symptoms of other   serious complaints has   suddenly been taken much   worse, and I deemed it   advisable to release him   to return to his home,  where I trust with proper   care and treatment he   may again be restored   to health.  Elder Wagstaff, 
 I will now close hoping  to soon have the pleasure of  meeting you.    The elders all u-  nite with me in sending  our best love and congratu-  lations.    Praying for God's  choicest blessings to attend  you,    I am your humble servant,  Angus T. Wright. 
 the 55 pounds now to your credit.    50£ of the above was deposited be brother  Ezra T. Stevenson, and the balance (5£) is the  remainder from the 30£ sent for brother  Smellie's return fare, 25£ of which was   used by brother S. O. Taft.    The reason I write thus early for  the return fares, I start next week on another  extended tour in the country, and will proba-  bly have no opportunity of writing for next  mail. If the draft is mailed to come  on boat sailing Aug. 23rd it will be in  ample time, as I have sufficient now to  send the fare to the Elder in Australia, if  necessary.    The work is progressing about as  usual. The Elders are quite energetic  and the majority of Saints are rejoic-  ing in the blessings of the Gospel: Many  times the question is asked by them, "When  are we to go to Zion?" "Why does not the   prophet call us to the promised land?" They  are no exception, for they get the spirit of gather-  ing, as do their white brethren, on their  obedience to the principles of the Gospel.    Praying God to abundantly bless you 
 has been very energetic   in all his duties, and   is much respected by   the Saints with whom  he has labored.    Elder Wagstaff has   been in this field nearly   twenty months.    I have given him   25 pounds out of what   I had on hand, and   must therefor ask you   to kindly add this amount   to the draft which I wrote   for last week.    Please excuse this   short scribble, as I   am very busy.  The   horses are saddled and   the Elders are waiting   for me.    We have just held

 (Recd 22 Dec. 1890.)  J. S. Bingham    Ahipara, Nov. 20, 1890.    Prest Wilford Woodruff,   Box B.   Salt Lake City:    Dear Brother:    It affords me pleas-  ure to again write you, and I   am thankful to be able to re-  port myself and the Elders   in good health.    Since writing to you from Tautoni,   I in company with Elders Nye   and Cutler, have been down to   the extreme north end of the   island, visiting all of the native   villages, and have had the priv-  ilege of bearing our testimony to   many who had never before seen   a Mormon Elder. As a rule we   were kindly received, and attentively 
 listened to, but in some places they   were so bitterly prejudiced by   mendacious reports circulated among   them by our enemies that they   would not allow us to hold meet-  ings. Wherever we could get a hear-  ing, I think we allayed much of   the prejudice and left the people   more favorably impressed with   what the world calls Mormonism.    At one place a European and   several natives desired baptism,   but as we did not think the na-  tives sufficiently enlightened, we   advised them to wait till some   future visit of the elders.    There are some fine people in this   section, and I trust that they will   eventually accept the truth.    We are now at the house of   a Half Caste who has a European 
 wife and a large family. Tomorrow   we shall have the pleasure of lead-  ing him into the waters of baptism,   and his wife being quite favorable,   we hope in time to baptize them   all.    Since writing I have heard from   most of the presidents of districts.    Several excommunications, are   reported but no baptisms showing   that the adversary is still at work;   not only in hardening the hearts and   blinding the minds of the outsiders;   but also in leading astray those   who have been initiated into the   truefold.    I have not heard from the breth-  ren in Australia since Prest. Wright's   return.    Elders Heywood, Young, Nye and   Dame will be released to return home 
 next April. Please send us two new   elders to take their place. The mission   is well supplied with elders at present,   but I think it best for two to come   and be acquiring the language,   as another company will be released   about next October    A report is going the rounds   at present to the effect that a   manifesto forbidding the practice   of polygamy has been issued by   the President of the Mormon Church;   and ratified by a mass meeting of   15,000 Mormons. The newspapers are all   commenting upon it, and we are every-  where plied with questions concerning   it. Having heard nothing authentic,   we treat this as a rumor of the same   nature as the hundreds of others   which are continually being put in   circulation concerning us, still we 
 would be pleased to learn from   you whither ^any^ action has been taken   to give foundation to such a report?    The spring has been unusually   cold and stormy, but it is now fine, and   becoming quite warm. The prospect   is that crops will be good, and the na-  tives will have plenty of food next win-  ter.    They are most all at home   at this season of the year and it is   an excellent time for the Elders to   travel among the outsiders, but as   soon as the season of cultivation is   is over they scatter out into the   gumfields, and it is hard to reach   them. We could not have chosen a   better time for our visit to this end,   as wherever they would receive us at   all we had crowded houses    There have been some riots of late 
 among the natives of what is known   as the King Country, and several   who are guilty of plundering stores   etc., have been arrested and are now   in custody. We are in hopes that   something will transpire to lessen   the influence of King Tawhio and   Te Kooti, the Maori Prophet, so   that their followers will accept the   gospel. As it is at present they are so   carried away by foolish vagaries that   they will not listen to anything rea-  sonable.    The health of the Saints I believe   is generally good. Many are trying   to live their religion, and are mak-  ing commendable progress in the   knowledge of the gospel, while others   I am sorry to say are yielding to   temptation, and returning to their "wal-  lowing in the mire." 
 Some are becoming anxious to go   to Kiona, (Zion), but I think it quite   wise to help them here until they prove  themselves worthy.    There are, no doubt, a few worthy   persons who, surrounded as they are  by the contaminating influences of   the world, yield to temptation, while   under more favorable circumstances   they might perhaps endure faithful;   but in my opinion there are many   more who would eventually fall   away even were they permitted to   emigrate, and it is far better to purge   them out and have them here than   to take them to Zion. There is too much   dross there already. I find that many   have been baptized without a knowl  edge of the gospel, and my experience   is that it is more difficult to convert   a person after baptism than before. 
 Most of the European Saints are la-  boring with a view to going to Utah,   but some of them are in very poor   circumstances being destitute of all   comforts, and having barely sufficient   to sustain life.    I will not weary you further.   Hoping to hear from you soon,   and continually praying for the   onward progress of truth and right-  eousness, I remain as ever    Your Brother in Christ,   J. S. Bingham    Address, General P. O.   Auckland 
 Tantoru Oct. 25 1890    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,  Box B.,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    It now becomes   my pleasant duty to write you,  and inform you of my where  abouts.    Your letter informing me  of my appointment to the presi-  dency of the Australasion Mission  came to hand by due course of mail  and was, it is useless to say, a great  surprise to me. I feel very weak in  having to assume so great respon-  sibility, but I sincerely hope and  trust that God in His infinite  mercy will bless me with wis-  dom, and bestow upon me all 
 other qualifications requisite to the  proper performance of all labors  and duties connected with the   management of His affairs in  this land, as I earnestly desire to  magnify my calling acceptably and  for the interest of the mission.    Since the departure of Prest. Wright  and companions for home, I have  been traveling in the Bay of Islands  District in company with Elders Nye  and Hixson. We have had the  pleasure of baptizing eight persons.    On account of scarcity of food and  for other reasons we thought it not  advisable to hold any conferences   in this part of the island, so I am  traveling through the districts visit-  ing the branches and speaking  to the people as opportunities are af-  forded. It seems that gleaning and 
 sifting is the process at present, as  all of the natives have all heard  the testimony of the Elders, and it  is quite difficult to awaken any  interest.    The Elders I believe are all  in good health. Sister Dunford at  last account was also well and per-  forming her dutises as teacher quite  satisfactorily. The school is well  patronized, the present enrollment  being forty five.    Prest. Wright with the compa-  ny of Elders and Saints I suppose  will arrive at San Francisco today,  and ere this reaches its destination  you no doubt will have had an  interview with him and learned  of the general condition of affairs  in the mission    Bro. Geo. E. Woolley having la- 
 bored in Australia for two years,  will be released to return home  in January. Plese send by re-  turn mail a check for thirty pounds  to pay his return fare.    In replying to this, please ad-  dress me at Shortland, Thames,  Hauraki, and the month ^following^ at  General P.O. Aauckland.    Ever praying for the progress of truth  and for the welfare of yourself and  the saints in general I am    Your Brother in the Gospel  J. S. Bingham.    [upside-down text] J. S.

 J S. Bingham  Recd 8 Aug. 1891.    Opuawhanga N. Z.   July 13, 1891.    Prest. Woodruff,  S. L. CityUtah.    Dear Brother:    Again I embrace  the opportunity of writing  you. I am thankful to state  that I am still well, and   that the elders, though some are  not robust, are all able to   travel and perform their du-  ties. The weather thus far this  winter has not been so cold  and stormy as it was last  winter, and there has been  less sickness and death  among the natives, though  a few have succumbed to  la grippe    I very much regret to 
 report the release of Elder  [redacted]  for misconduct.    He through the weakness  of the flesh yielded to the  temptation of the adversary, and  made improper overtures to a  young Maori woman. He did  not commit himself, but ac-  cording to his own confession  would have done so had a   favorable opportunity pre-  sented itself. He seems fully  to realize the gravity of his mis-  take, and is suffering the most  bitter remorse. It is a most de-  plorable affair, and is some-  thing that has been carefully  guarded against ever since  the opening of this mission  among the Maori people as  we fully realized how disas- 
 astrous it would be to the cause  of truth should any of the   elders be found guilty of a   violation of the law of chas-  tity among this simple-minded  and confiding people, but the  long dreaded evil has at last  befallen us. Just how detrimen-  tal this sad affair will prove  we at present cannot tell, but  I fear that it will be some-  time before we regain that  implicit confidence which  the natives have hitherto placed  in us as servants of the Lord.    We shall endeavor as we  have ever done to show in the  most emphatic way possi-  ble our disapproval of such  conduct, and fervently pray  to God to counteract the  evil influence that the

All of the Elders are  well except Bro. J. H. Burton whose  lungs seem quite deeply affect-  ed. I have appointed him to  a different field of labor, and  if the change does not work  an improvement in his condi-  tion, I shall release him ac-  cording to your instruction, as  I am afraid that he will not  stand another wet unpleas-  ant winters unless he gets relief.

Cutler that  he will go by this boat.    Prospects are not so bright  in Queensland as when Elder  Cutler last wrote me.    The elders accepted a chal-  lenge to a two evenings' discuss-  ion on the authenticity of the Book  of Mormon. Their opponent  was a leading minister of  the Christ Diciples, or Camp-  bellites, as they were formerly  called. His arguments consist-  ed almost entirely of a reitera-  tion of the "Solomon Spaulding 
 Our annual conference was  a most enjoyable one. Nine-  teen Elders, Sister Dunford and  about five hundred natives were  present. The Spirit of the Lord  was bestowed in rich abund  ance, and harmony and good  feeling raeigned. The Elders are  unanimous in saying that it  was the best conference that they  have attended in this land.    A few of the saints were sick,  but our Heavenly Father in  His tender and loving mercy  heard and answered our sup-  plications in their behalf, and  they were raised up from  their beds of affliction. One  young ^man^ who was very bad, and  to whom we administered sev-  eral times during conference, came 
 to prayers the next morning  after its close and participated  in the services by announcing  and leading the hymn.    Owing to so many ^elders^ having  returned home before their mis-  sions were fulfilled we find  ourselves with an insufficient   number of Maori linguists, and  I was much perplexed in ma-  king the appointments, but through  the guidance of the Holy Spirit  I arranged them in a way that  I trust will be satisfactory and  for the good of the cause.    Elders Rasmussen, Gibson and   Douglass reached this land in  safety, and in time to be present  the last two days at conference.    The vacancies are all filled,  in fact we have too many 
 of Bro. Stewart before sending  an elder to take Elder Bromley  place as traveling companion  for Brother Dalling.    We are preparing to hold a  conference in the Bay of Islands  District on the 25 & 26 inst. This  will be the ^first^ conference that we  have been able to hold in the  north end of the Island since  Bro. Wright's return. If the weather  is favorable we expect a good  attendance, and hope with the  help of the Lord to infuse a  alittle life into the Ngapuhi  saints the most of whom have   always been rather indifferent  to the principles of the gospel.    As Sister Dunford since  the birth of her child is not  able to continue her efficient  and highly beneficial labors 
 men in field I think at present.    The four Elders whose mis-  sions are fulfilled were honora-  bly released, and are now at  Auckland preparing to sail for  home on the 25th inst. All have  labored faithfully and well and  performed honorable missions.    One or two saints from here, and  perhaps a few from Australia will  accompany them, though ^I^ have  not heard anything definite  from Elder Cutler concerning  them. Elder Jos. N. Heywood will  have charge of the company.    Elder Nye reports a revival  among the people of the Bay of  Islands District where for the last  two years the Saints or "Mormons"  have been so cold and indifferent  to the Gospel and the teachings 
 as teacher of the Maori  children, I have decided to  release her to return with me  in September. In addition to  that which I asked for in  my last letter, please send  £55 for her return fare and  that of Elder Roskelly which  I have borrowed    Hoping this will find  you and your associates  in the priesthood well and  in the enjoyment of all  blessings requisite to your  happiness, peace and prosperity    I am as ever  Your Brother in the Gospel,    Jno.

 of the Elders. We have for some  time past had grave fears that  all of the Ngapuhi people would  prove recreant to their sacred  covenants, and forsake the gospel,  but we now entertain hopes that  a few at least will prove faith-  ful. The condition in other local-  ities remains unchanged.    Our brethren laboring in Aus-  tralia have been somewhat crip-  pled in their efforts to do good  through a scrarcity of tracts with  which to work. They have paid  for the publication of a few out  of their own pockets, but this in con-  nection with their other expenses  makes it rather hard on them.    I donot know how missions  that are not self supporting are  provided with such things, but

Roskelly is sorely peni-  tent, and I wish that I could save  him the humitiation and disgrace  of returning under such circumstan  ces, but I cannot feel that it would  be right to allow him to remain  in the field. I am pleased to learn  that his conduct has had no ap-  parent effect on the Maori thus far.    I received today a draft for £30 which  I suppose is to pay return fare of   Elder Bromley.

This has been a fruitful sea  son in this land except in those   localities where the crops were  greatly damaged or totally de-  stroyed by floods which ocurred  during the heavy rains which  fell in the months of January  and February.

Beck, of  Paris Idaho, is the best quali-  fied for the presidency. He is 23  years of age, is a faithful ener-  getic laborer, quite proficient  in the native language, and  I think has a good under-  standing of the Gospel. The  time for his release will be  next October. 
 Auckland Aug, 15 1891    Prest. Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    President Stewart and party  arrived at Auckland on the 13th  inst. all  in good health having had a pleasant   voyage.    I shall travel with him one  month in the districts adjacent to Auck-  land before taking leave of the mission  and the saints of the Lord for my home in  Zion. By that time he will have a suffi-  cient understanding of the affairs of the mission  to take charge thereof.    Elder Ephram Johnson of Brigham  City of whom I previously made  mention is still suffering and has lately  made some disclosures in relation to his phys-  ical condition of which I had been in igno-  rance. His ailment is I think of such a na-  ture as to warrant his release and return even  though he retain sufficient strength to travel in   his field of labor. He has reluctantly accepted  his release, and will accompany me home next

 Of those who have a longer  time to stay, Elder Ephraim  Johnson, of Brigham City I  think would be the most ca-  pable of filling the position    He also is 23 years of age, and  has been in the mission nearly   two years. While not so fluent  in the language as Elder   Beck, he is better qualified ed-  ucationally. Physically he is  not well adapted to the arduous  labors of this office, as he is not nat-  urally strong, and ^has^ now just  recovered from a severe spell of  sickness of forty day duration,  which, but for the power of the   Priesthood, might have proved  fatal.    Neither of these Elders has

 had any experience except  what has been gained during  their labors in this land, and  being quite young they would  not have as much influence  with the natives as a more el-  derly person would be able to  wield. In my opinion, therefore,  it will be better for the interests  of the Mission ^if^ some person of   wisdom and experience be sent  from home to take the presidency,  especially if one could be sent who  is already familiar with the Maori  language.    At our Semi annual Con-  ference held on January 9, 10, 11, Elder  Heber S. Cutler was appointed to  suceed Elder Geo. E. Woolley in  the presidency of the Australian 
 District. He reached his des-  tination in safety and re-  ports all well in that land.    Elder Woolley was to  start home via England  on January 31st.    There have been no changes  of special importance in the  affairs of the mission since  I last wrote you. The Elders  are well, and are laboring  with unabated energy  to deliver that important mes-  sage which has been commit-  ted unto them.    Since writing the above, a let-  ter from Elder Woolley has come to  hand. He says that Elder Brom-  ley, whose time is fulfilled, has no  means of returning home unless

I have waited until  the last day thinking that there  might have been something from  you by the last boat, but my  mail has not yet come to hand.    The Zealandia was three days  behind time, and I having ap-  pointments to meet, could not wait,  hence the long delay in my mail.    As I was leaving KawaKawa I  on the 10 inst. I received a telegram  from Elders Gilbert Meikle and  Joseph Roskelley, announcing their  safe arrival at Auckland, and 
 he receives assistance from the  Church. His brother in Melbourne,  from h whom he expected pecuni-  ary aid, turns to him a cold  shoulder, and there is no one  at home to whom he can apply.    Bro. Woolley feels that it is high-  ly necessary that he be sent home,  and I therefore take the liberty  of laying the matter ^before you^ for your  consideration.    Hoping to hear from you  soon, and ever praying that the  choicest blessings of God be bestowed  upon you, I remain as ever,    Your Brother in the Gospel,  Jno. S. Bingham.    Address   c/o P. P.

Woodruff,  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother:    Your welcome and   anxiously looked for letter of   April 27th was received on the   27th ult., and its contents were pe-  rused with the usual pleasure   and interest.    We were pleased to hear   that you and your associ-  ates were well, and that the   ravages of la grippe are abat-  ing.  I trust that ere this time   they have entirely ceased    The health of the elders in   this land and that of the saints   in general is good, and as for   myself, I enjoy the best of   health continually not having 
 asking for instructions. It was quite  a surprise to me, as I had received  no intimation that there would be  elders by this boat, and consequently  had made no arrangements whatever  for anybody to meet them at Auck-  land    I instructed them to go to Hau-  raki, and remain until conference to  be held on January 9, when they   will be assigned to their fields of la-  bor.    These will be sufficient to fill  all of the vacancies that will be oc-  casioned by the release of the next  company of elders, therefore it will  not be necessary to send us any new  elders in April.    Several of the Elders here have  been in rather poor health of late.    Bro. Ephraim Johnson was quite bad

 been disqualified one day   through sickness.    At this season of the year  there is usually a great deal   of sickness among the natives   occasioned by exposure to cold   and dampness, but thus far   there has been but little a-  mong the saints.    I was much pleased to   hear of the appointment of   Elder Wm. T. Stewart to the   presidency of the Australasian   Mission.  I think it a wise   selection and one that will  give universal satisfaction a-  mong the Maori saints.  By them   Bro. Stewart is held in high es-  teem, and they never weary   of speaking of his many   merits.    I think it will be best for 
 for a while, but at last accounts was  improving. Elder J. H. Burton seems to  be troubled with some pulmonic aff[l]iction  and unless there is an improvement in  his condition, I am afraid that he will  not be able to stand another winter in  this wet climate.    I am in receipt of a letter from  Elder Geo. E. Woolley, who in connect-  ion with Bro. A. L. Young is laboring  in Queensland, Australia. They have  succeeded in making an opening  and present prospects are favorable.    Bro. Woolley is quite sanguine  that a good work will be performed  there in the near future. They for some  time had been holding open air meet-  ings as often as four time a week with  good attendance    In Melbourne where Elders Brom-  ley and Dalling are very little is being

 the elders who accompany him   to purchase through tickets to   Australia, as there will be no   vacancies in New  Zealand  at that time.    For some time I have felt   impressed to explain to you   the situation of the mission and   make some suggestions in re-  gard to the number of elders   required, that you might be   governed thereby in sending el-  ders to this land.  Knowing that   the time for my release was   drawing nigh, I have deferred   writing, thinking that I could  more easily explain the sit-  uation verbally than by let-  ter, but as some time will e-  lapse before I see you, I   now submit my views for   your consideration. 
 accomplished. The people take no in-  terest in the gospel, there are very  few opportunities for holding public  meetings, and very little can be done  except by means of tracts. Having no  tracts with which to work at present,  they are at loss to know how to  proceed. I think that we have a  few English tracts at Auckland  which I shall send to them when  I reach that point    Elder Woolley will start home in  January via England. I shall send  an Elder from here to take his place.    Please send us a check for £120  to pay return fare of Elders J. S. Nye,  J. S. Dame, J. N. Heywood, and T. C.  Young who will be released to return  home in April.    Since writing you, we have re-  ceived the Deseret News containing  the report of the October Conference in- 
 When Prest. Wm. Paxman was   laboring here, the harvest was   great and many laborers were   meeded, but since that time   the harvest seems measurable   to have passed, and at present   there is but little desire on the   part of out-siders for the gos-  pel and little opportunity to   labor among them.    The mission is divided in-  to districts or conferences, with   towo or three elders in each   district.  Some of these districts   are quite small with no   apparent prospect of becom-  ing any larger, and the el-  ders being compelled to spend  most of the time among the   saints, become rather bur-  densome.  If some of the dis-  tricts were joined together, which

Notwithstanding the  many reports containing it that had  previously reached ours ears, it was  a great surprise to me, as I could not  believe that such an action had been  taken; but while I deeply regret the  necessity of such a move, I accept it  as the will of God, and feel to give  it my sanction, as do also all of  the Elders with whom I have had  the privilege of conversing on the sub-  ject.    It seems to be one of the great  tests of the latter days, and doubtless  will prove such to some of our  people; but at present it apears to  be more of a trial for our enemies  than anyone else. Although it is 
 can be conveniently done, and  the number of elders diminish-  ed, I think it would be much  better for the interests of the  mission. I am confident that  as much would be accom-  plished, and the elders would  labor with more satisfac-  tion to themselves and the  saints. Besides this, there would  be a great saving of time  and means.    On Poverty Bay and Warapa  Districts, for instance, there  are five elders where three at  the most are sufficient    I have thought if sending  two elders, or one elder and a  native to Chatham Island  to try to open the mission  there, but thus far I have not  found it practicable.

 what they have been so long clamoring  for, it now appears to be exactly what  they did not want. It shows them up  in their true light, and reveals to the  world that their mad crusade is  not against one single principle  of our religion but against all,  that their real object and desire is po-  litical domination in the Territory, the  plunder of the hard earnings of the Saints  and the utter extinction of the "Mormons"  as a people.    I trust that the Lord will bless  his people with a spirit of humility and  wisdom that their faith may not wa-  ver, but that they may yield implicit  obedience to all of his laws and com-  mandments thus bringing about their  own deliverance from oppression.

I don't know how extensively  the Gospel has been preached  in Australia, but it seems to  me that a few more elders might  labor there to good advan-  tage.

 J. S. Bingham  20 May 1891  Recd 13 June [1891]    Greytown North  May 20, 1891    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,  Box B., Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    Your much val-  ued communication under  date of March 30th has been  received. Its contents were pe-  rused with much interest and  highly appreciated, as are all  of you instructive and en-  couraging correspondences    I regret very much to learn   of the death of President Daniel  H. Wells. But while we mourn  his loss, there is great consola-  tion in the assurance that  having kept the faith and  fought the good fight, he has  gone to the realms of bliss where 
 he can rest from the toils and  trials of the the flesh while he  enjoys the society of holy men  of God, and mingles his voice  in council with those who have  preceded him to the mansions  of our Heavenly Father.    I am pleased to state that  the Elders are in the enjoyment  of sufficient health and strength  to be able to perform their du-  ties. Elder J. H. Burton, whom I  mentioned in my last as being  quite ill, is now much better  and is pursuing his labors as usu-  al. I think he is troubled with  asthma, and this heavy damp  atmosphere is quite severe on  him at times, but I trust that  by being cautious he will be a-  ble to remain until his mis-  sion is fulfilled which is his 
 earnest desire.    Your letter of Oct. 15, 1890 has  not come to hand, and conse-  quently I did not received any  instruction concerning the re-  lease of Elder Wm. Bromley un-  til receipt of your last. I have  borrowed £30 to pay the expen-  ses of his return, and have sent  him his release. Owing to a de-  lay in the transfer of the mon-  ey, I think he will not be able  to start home until June.    I do not know of any one to ac-  company him. I have written El-  der Cutler to advise him to wait  till he can have company if  he thinks it unsafe for him to  go alone.    You did not state whether  you sent a check for his return  fare. 
 News from Australia is still  somewhat encouraging. Infor-  mation has been received from Elder  Cutler of a few new baptisms, and  prospects are favorable for the per-  formance of more work. On this is-  land also the Europeans are begin  ning to accept our testimony. Within  the last month eleven have been  baptized, and many others are  investigating. Opportunities to hold  meeting with them are increasing    I trust that a good work will  yet be performed among them.    With an earnest prayer for the on-  ward progress of the work of the Lord,  and hoping you are all well,    I remain,  Your Brother,  in Truth,  John S. Bingham.    Ad. General P. O.  Auckland 
 [sideways text] W. F. Stewart  May 10th 1892. [end of sideways text]    Gisborne New Zealand  May 10th 1892.    President Wilford Woodruff, and Counsellors.  Salt Lake City, Utah,    Dear Brethren,    I anticipated a  remittance of 3 returns fares (£90.0.0) for the last  three Elders goining home, viz H. D. Haight who  sailed Feby 27, John H Burton who sailed Apl 23rd  and Jos S. Groesbeck who left for home by way of  Europe on 30th of last month; These Elders have  all filled good missions in this land. In returning  them I had to borrow of Bro. Hardy £40, which  with the £50 which was sent me some months  ago made up the Sum. I hope it will not be  longer than another month till I can pay him.    Enclosed please find the Statistical  Report of this Mission which I have not at present  an opertunity of comparing with the last one, but  will say that it like previous ones contains names  which should be eliminated to the extent of consider-  ably reducing the total, by increasing ^the^ deaths & excom-  munication totals, as numbers who have been   baptized have went off and never returned, having  either died or apostatized, but it will be some  time before this can be regulated so that the reports 
 will correspond closely with our exact numbers.    Our Anual conference was held  at Te Rahui Waiapu Valley which is at the Eastcape.  The Southren districts were well represented, but only  the Elders came from the northren. Our meetings  were well attended the large carved Maori house  being crowded in nearly every meeting. It was  held on the 8th 9th and 10th of April. From the reports  and my personal acquaintance can say, that  while the numbers in the mission have been decreas-  ing, yet many of the Saints are increasing their  faith and diligence and are not near the children  in understanding they were upon coming in to the  church, anvery many of them have kept themselves  Straigt. I am happy to say, since they first received  the Gospel, and give promise of being so unto the end  and Shows the results of the good labors in this land  not only of those "who planted", but those who have  been "watering", as well as manifesting the Grace  of "God who giveth the increase" and is a source of  Joy and thanksgiving to those who labor here.  We have been much troubled with the vice of gambling,  ^especially on horse races,^ amongst this people, and where they have been dealt  leniently with in this matter it has generally resulted  in drunkeness, adultery, etc. In endeavoring to  stop it, some have been excommunicated, where they 
 have defiantly persisted therein, in the district where  the latter course has been pursued and it has  been nipped in the bud, success has seemingly  attended, and this evil is well under hand ^in those districts^ at present  And the Elders generally feel that it is the better  course to pursue. Yet our home mail brings  news that this evil is rappidly on the increase at home,  and those indulging therin, does not seem to be  called in question; In fact it appears that some  who should be examples to the people because of  their position's are leading they way. And the question  naturally arises in our minds, wether we are  justifed in dealing with this people for this offence,  when it is not a question of fellowship with the  ^more experienced^ Saints in Zion.    The Saints here were anxious to  have the Doctrine & Covenants translated into their  language, but when I gave them your advice  upon it they seemed willing to let it rest, but  asked if the Ready Reference could not be printed  in their language I told them I would refer the  matter to you. And will added that if it was  printed with the Book of Mormon references, which  are in small type figures in the compendium, it  would no doubt be of much benefit to them  and to the Elders laboring here. 
 In Australia four Elders are laboring, but with  little success further than keeping a live the  few members in that vast country, and warning  the wicked inhabitants thereof. Two labor in victoria  and two in Queesland and at last report ^in^ both places  they were keeping bachelors hall when at head quarters.  The few Saints in that land appear to be very poor and  scattered, and the greater part of them very week in the  faith. And it is really questionable in my mind  whether we ought to keep that part of the mission up    If you could send me a few hun-  dred blanks forms ^for^ Statistical ^reports^ they would be much  appreciated.    I believe all the Elders in the mission  have good health, at least so far as I know, and  those on this Island left our conference in good  Spirits. I now have a very fair personal knowledge  of the condition of the Mission, having visited most of the  branches to do which have traveled about 3000 miles by on   horseback and several hundred by Steamer and rail. And  while some of the districts are in a bad condition, upon  the whole we have much to Encourage us.    Ever desiring the welfare of Zion and  the triumph of truth, I am, as I ever hope to be,  obediently yours.    W. T. Stewart. 
 Te Hauke,  New Zealand, April 12th 1893.    Prest W. Woodruff, Box. B. Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother,    Your favor of Feb. 27th came duly to   hand. The Elders referred to therein arrived safely,   and were present at our Conference, just closed.    The two drafts, for £91.12.8, and £10.1.3, came to   hand, and were duly forwarded to the Bank.    The notice of reduction probably is too late to apply   to Elder H. B. Dalling, in Australia, as I had   previously sent unto him his fare from the amount   on deposit. In relation to the reduction I beg to   submit that the amount ^named^ would be sufficient if   parties ^were^ sailing from Auckland or Sydney for Salt  Lake, but releases most frequently find Elders in   their fields of labor, far removed from either of these   ports, requiring from £1 to £4 to reach either of them,   so that the former allowance left a margin ranging   from $£25 to Nil, after necessary hotel expenses, in   Auckland & San Francisco, were paid, but, in cases   where the returning Elders resided far from Salt Lake   and releases found found them at the farthest points   from sailing port, even the former allowance was 
 inadequate. In cases where there has been a   margin of any considerable amount it has been   found almost indispensible, to enable the Elders   to make themselves presentable for travelling, for   which reason I have not felt justified in recommending   a reduction of the fares.    I hope to make arrangements with one of the   Saints, who is going to Zion this month, for an exchange   of money, whereby I will obtain sufficient funds, at   your last mentioned rates, for the return fares of   Elders J. M. Hendry, J. M. Hixson, J. G. Kelson and E. Atkin,   (respecting which I wrote you Feb. 13th) drawing an   order on you for the amount, viz: $500.    Should I succeed, the order will be presented to   you before May 17th. In case that it is not presented   at that date, you will please forward the return   fares for above-named Elders, but If, upon consideration   of the foregoing, you should deem it proper to   remit a larger sum, the balance may be forwarded,   if the above-mentioned order is presented.    I shall require four Elders to leave San  Francisco, Aug 18th, amongst which, if possible, I   would like another of our old Maori missionaries,   who learned the language. 
 President Paxman will be able to advise you   respecting those who labored under his direction.    Elders Madsen, ^Dalling^ Hales, and Andrus will   return to Zion this month, accompanied by three   families of Europeans Saints, numbering about   17 souls.    A native brother and his wife have   importuned me very earnestly to permit them   to accompany me home, with a view of   permanently locating there.    The husband speaks enough English for all   practicable purposes, and is very industrious and   economical. They have been very exemplary   members since their baptism in 1884.    I feel that they would be contented and prosperous   in Zion, but do not wish to encourage them   without your permission, and I mention it   now, that, in case you sanction their gathering,   they can make preparations after your advice   reaches me.    Our Annual Conference has just closed   and all the Elders present feel that the Mission   is in a prosperous condition. 
 We had a large gathering and a good   spirit prevailed.    Enclosed please find our Semi Annual  Statistical Report.    The health of the Elders is very good, and   all join in kind regards,    Your Brother in the Gospel,    W T Stewart  President of the Australasian Mission.    P. S.  Elders Oscar Andrus, H. B. Dalling, Hans Madsen,  and George Hales, the returning   Elders above referred to, have   performed honorable and faithful   missions in this land.  W. T. S.  BG    [sideways text] W. T.

Dear Brothren;    In april last I wrote   you enquiringly about a native who had impor-  tuned me to allow him and his wife to accom-  pany me to my home.  There was also another   native with wife & one child who had then decided   and is now fully decidedtermined to go to Zion as   soon as he can finish selling his lands and settling   his business. the latter one has already sent £200.0.0  to Utah investing in sheep, and sa short time ago   informed me that he had £300.0.0 more he   would like to send to put in sheep which business   he would like to follow. both of these speak English   good enough for all practicalble purposes.

We will   require four Elders to take the places of Elders   that will be released to return home about July 15th  they should come by the Steamer which is booked   to leave San fFrancisco May 26th.    If a good   supply of Morgans Nos 1 and 2 and Richs "True   vs false Religion" ^Tracts^ could be sent out by these   brethren they would be very much appreciated   by the Elders laboring among the Europeans    And by the same mail will need return   fares for Elders J.

Yet a few of the saints in different parts seem   very anxious to go, and the Spirit of gathering   resting upon them seems irrepressable,  another   case I failed to mention is the mother of the   the maori boy who went home with my nephew   J C Stewart in 1886.  and is now a young man   living at Kanab, and quite able to look   after his mother and two younger brothers  She has been deserted by her husband, and   suffers very much from asthma, but is one   of the most faithful of saints.  beleiieveing that   our dry mountain air would give her a new   lease of life and that naught but good can   possibly result from her goining I have so advised,  but in her case only.  However I feel strongly impressed   that it will be greatly to the advantage of this mission   If a few here and there of the most faithful and   those best calculated to look out for themselves were   to gather out, that they may go there and become  accustomed to the new conditions, thereby being a great   aid to those who should follow them yet a believe   
 Our native mission here is coming on, as   well I think, as we can reasonably expect. In  our efforts to put down betting in all its various   forms your direct and pointed counsel has been   of great benefit carrying weight and influence   with the natives, and all ^thus far^ with with only one or   two exceptions have agreed to cease this vice which   have been depriving those engaging therein of a   free flow of the Holy Spirit. There is a marked   improvement going on with those who are faithful  in this land.    Preparations are now being made   for our April Conference to be held at Te Hauke  and the Saints and Elders are looking forward   to that event with much pleasure.   1893 has thus far distinguished itself, ^on th[e]se islands^ in the   peculiararity of its weather and the number of its  earthquakes it has thus far produced. New Zeal-  and has had a couple of miniture cyclones, whilst   in Australia unprecedented floods in some sections   and drougth in others have done ^an^ imme[n]se ammount  of damage greatly increasing the suffering, desti-  tution and misery which has prevailed there for two or   three years and the end is probably not yet  for the inhabitants are reported as being in the   main anv ungodly, immoral set, many of them   keeping up no "form of Godliness" whilst the great   majority of those who do are "lovers of pleasure   more than lovers of God"  they seem to be    
 rappidly preparing themselves for the wrath and   indignation of an offended God which will as   surely be poured out upon the unrepentant and rebelleous   inhabitants, ^of the earth^ as it has been foretold by the spirit   of prophecy and the revelations of the Almighty.    In the main the Elders seem to sense the   responsibility the Lord has placed upon them  in by calling them to preach repentance and warn  mankind. And are endeavoring to perform this   labor of love as the Spirit directs that their   garments may be free from the blood of this   generation.    We feel that the   Lord is still softening the hearts of the enemies   of Zion as is manifested by Judge Zanes recent   decision in the church suit, the granting of   am^n^esty, dismissing of old cases against our   brethren, and the general disposition of the press  and people to deal more freely with the saints.  We have watched with no little interest the recent  political contest in our Territory and while we   regret the spirit of strife and bitterness manifested   by many of the saints when carried away with   the excitment of debate wherein crimination and   recrimination was indulged and offensive person-  alities were substituted for argument, yet  we think experiences of this nature are necessary,  sooner or a later, are necessary to qualify the   saints to assume that high position among the 
 great care should be exercised in selecting those who   are first advised to go, to avoid if posible murmuring   and dissatisfaction on their part till they be come   thouroughly established.  I am satifed that the nations   of New Zealand, owing to the severer climate, poorer   soil and meagre natural productions of the country   they inhabit are naturally much better fitted for   residence in the valleys of the Rockies than the inhabi-  tants of other Islands of the pacific where dwell   members people of this interesting race, whilst their   extensive associantions, and business intercourse with   Europeans for a generation will enable them to   readily assimilate with our people at home.  all of the young men ^are^ expected here to earn their   own living even when the family's to which they   belong are, by virtue of lands, rents, or stock posesses,   comparatively independant.

The probably payout more for clothing   and nearly as much for groceries as the average   white labourer, except in those isolated 
 nations which they are destined to occupy and the  sooner begins their political education the sooner  will they be prepared but howe much better if  the saints could avoid such unwarranted extremes,  however those who will are saints indeed will  come through all th[e]se experiences and acknowledge  Gods hand therein and that his power and  blessings are with his people and that the  course of Zion is upward and onward desiring   to labor to that end and to keep pace ^there^ with.

[sideways text] ^2 more Elders^ [end of sideways text]    In addition to the   two companies of Elders sent for, if  Two more   could be sent direct to Australia, ^in Sept. or Oct.^ it would aid   very much in the work there, as a spirit of   enquiry is being aroused there as well as in other   parts of the mission.  The wall of prejudice & intolerence,   which have so long stood between the servants of   God and the hearts of the people, seem of late to   be crumbling away.  The impartial accounts, published   throughout this part of the world, of the Salt Lake   Temple and its dedication have contributed no little   to this end.    I have recently learned that Elder   Jas S. Abbott, of Annabella Sevier Co. Utah, who landed   here in Oct 6th 1892.  And of whose coming I was   duly notified, received his endowments in the Manti   Temple, July 22nd of that year.  Afterwards or Aug 18th  he married a wife at Hinckley by Bp Pratt of that 
 districts of the interior where the live mainly   on a vegetable Potatoes & wild pork.  I have felt   to present this matter before you as we view it from   this point of obvsersvastion, at the same time desire to   be guided in this, as in all matters, by your inspired   wisdom.    Prisident Reynolds letter of July 18th   notifying me of the intended departure of the next   two companies of Elders for this field ^has been rec'd^ I see   by the papers that a change of the time of departure   of the steamers of this line from Frisco will occur   in October next leaving there one week earlier   than time table date.  The Steamship Co's office   here informed me that while they had received   no official notice as yet it was more than probable   that the change would be made.

 ward officiating he living with his wife as such   up to the time of his leaving home.  He says that   the President of the Temple, ^or whom he supposed, to be,^ advised this course after   he (Abbott) had related to him all the particulars of the   case.  He says also that "the Bishop of his ward and   Henry Clark of Richfield were both cognizant of   the circumstances."  I asked him if Bp Pratt knew   he had his endowments when he married him he   said "He could not say."  This matter being so   very irregular I cannot think but what some   blunder has been committed notwithstanding the   representations of Bro Abbott.  I therefore feel ^constrained^ to report   the matter to you and will anxiously await your   action thereon, as I have advised that he do no   ordinance work till the matter is cleared up, or   an authoritative explanation is received.    We have   been having an usually wet cold winter, rivers   flooded, and bridle paths in many places well nigh   impassable.  Notwithstanding which the health of   the elders is remarkably good, and their influence   is being felt for good especially among the   remnants of Israel in this land.

Beloved Brethren;    The last Sanfran-  cisco Steamer being ^delayed^ did ^not^ reach Auckland till after  the out going one had departed therefrom, thereby  preventing me from acquainting you earlier with  the safe arrival of Elders Goddard, Fisher, Palmer  & Chipman all of whom I think will make good  useful Elders in this field of labor. The Steerage  accomodations were very poor on the "Alameda" and  they were pleased to terminate the long unpleasant  voyage. Elder H. D. Haight who has been  honourably released from this mission to return home  had left the wharf about an hour before their arrival   per "S.S.

If this ammount can be   kept on deposet here it may avoid  great inconvenience in the future.  It  has been found necessary in the  past, on account of ill health and  for other causes, to return Elders home,  before return fares could be sent  for; Bro Hardy has been able, and  quite willing for many years  past to advance loans to the  mission till we could obtain returns  from home, but he is now talking 
 as clothing is about as cheap here as there, parties  would do better to send the money instead, except  in the case of "garments" only.    The health of all  the Elders in the mission was good at last accounts.  All have plenty to do. And while the immediate results of  their labors, many times, are not very encouraging. yet  upon the whole we feel very grateful that every thing  here in the mission is ass prosperous as it is, for there  are truly many good, warm hearted, whole souled  Saints in this mission, but it requires wisdom given  by God to deal with a people whose minds are so invironed  by the traditions, ^superstions,^ and habits of their race, which are not  readily comprehended by those not closely associated with  them. The gospel is striking these fetters from their  minds. their old priesthood with its witchcraft etc is  fast becoming a thing of the past. The young men now  work ^6 months^ on an average, each year for the Europeans at  Sheep Shearing etc, most of them have entirely adopted european  dress and many of them the manners and ways of their  white neighbours. Free government schools are imparting the  English language to the more ambitious children. So  that it would seem not far away in the future when  the remnant of the maori people will readily assimilate  with the most advanced races of the earth. I believe  the Maori is the most self reliant, industrious, and  progressive of the brown polynesian races, which

It will be well to  instruct the Elders in all cases where they are not  met in Auckland to go direct to Mrs. Donnelly's ^our Boarding place^  Upper Queen St. where I will have instructions  for them, provided I am notified of their coming  a month in advance. Those of them who are  accustomed to riding at home will find more  comfort with an American Saddle than with any  that could be bought here, but their Saddles Should  not be too heavy. Such as can be bought in Sanfrancisco  for about $2500 or even less will do, double rigged  cinchas are preferable in most of the districts.    I am  happy to say that at last accounts health of Elders  in the mission was good though Bro. Young in  Australia had just recovered from quite a severe  illness. Yourselves, with aids & helps in government  are always prayerfully rememered by us together with  the Saints and especially those who feel much tried  by the providential deliverance of Zion ^and her inhabitants^ in the Lords own  way, which "is not as man's way"    Ever praying, and humbly  laboring ^for^ the triumph of truth I remain, as I ever  hope to be, obediently yours in the work of our Lord    W.

I have sent for return  fares for three Elders ^£ 90,0,0^ whichh I expect  will reach here by next mail.    In regard to gathering  half easts who have been raised as  Europeans, etc. I will say, there  may be afew whose faith and  habits will justify us in advising  them to gather, but not many.    There may also be a few of full  natives whose faith, language and  mode of living, some having incomes  sufficient to keep them, would   warrant us in pursuing a similar  course with them, but this class  is also very limited.    In some dis-  -tricts I find the gathering to be  the principal theme of conversation 
 is due to the rigourr of his climate and the meagre  natural productions of his country. his industry however  was partially suspended while living on the proceeds  of large tracts of land sold to the foreinger. but after  exahausting his available lands he finds himself with  new tastes & desires, that it requires considerable exertion  to stattisfy. It seems the Lord has or will overrule all  this to bring about a Speedy restoration of this branch  if Israel to the lands of their fathers. Some of them  feel very anxious now, for that event to take place.    I expect Elders Standord, Dunford,  Thomas, Hawkes, who are laboring on this island  and Young and Thorpe who are in Australia will  be released to return home Novr 5th.

I believe they  accepted my explanation of the Situat-  -tion, especially when I called their  attention to the fact that scarcely one  of them had had their lands sub-  -divided, receiving or obtaining crown  grants therefor so they could sell  them, thereby providing themselves  withh means togather with.  I told  them further that no doubt when  they were fully prepared to gather  that the Lord would open up the  way for them to do so.

Dear Brethren,    Yours of Oct 14th conveying my  release and the appointment of brother William Gardner  to preside over the Saints in this part of the vinyard  came duly to hand.    We feel much gratifedied over  the privilege therein contained of a limited number of   the Saints being permitted to gather out of this land to  the bosom of the church, and feel that in the main it  cannot but result in much good not only to the majority   of those who go but to the work in general throughout these  islands. As to their location in the Kanab country, there  is probably no place in Utah, where, climate and everything  considered, ismore suitable. And as to the continuation of my   labors in Zion, for the benefit of this people, I can say,   that to do the will of the Lord is my only desire, whether  it involves duties naturally pleasant or otherwise, in this  case it will be a pleasure to me to render any service  I can to this people with whom I have been so much  associated, and in whose interes welfare I have felt so   deeply interested.

I have now  visited every native district, in some  of them the Saints are in ^a^ reasonably  fair condition, but in most of them,  there seems to have been a reaction  set in which will be found, when  a proper census can be had, to have  greatly reduced our numbers, Some of  these short lived ones appears to have  come ^in^ more through the example of thier  chiefs, than a personal conviction.  whilst others appear so addicted to-  sin and powerless to refrain therefrom  that it is utterly impossibly ^for them to live the  law.

 to go within a month from to day, the date fixed  for my departure, I can not at present say. As recent  legislation by the N. Z. Government has made it much   more dificult for them to advantagouly sell their lands,  limiting their purchasers to the Govt which of course need  only to give what they desire and which has usually been  much less than real value.    Brother Gardner is undoubt-  edly well adapted and peculiarly fitted for native work,  and will doubtless, in his ^extended^ labors, justify his selection  for this work.    Your instructions concerning  reports have been noted and we will endeavour to place  ourselves in harmony.    Elder Hamblin has been much afflicted in his                                                      eyes, so much so, that outdoor ^work^ seems very unwise, if not,   impossible for him. I therefore feel it proper to release him  to return to Zion, he will probably be under the doctors  treatment till Decr 30th the date of his departure, his  return fare can be sent to Prest Gardner whose address  will be same as mine.    With the exception of Elder Hamblin  the Elders are all reasonably well. Elder Gardner                                               only reached here last night and joins me in   kindest regards.

MyThe proposition for the publication of   the Ready References was well received and   unanimously sustained.    I believe it would be quite beneficial if some   of the Elders who have formerly labored successfully   amongst the Maories could occasionally be   returned & I respectfully submit this suggestion.

Dear Brethren,    I have pleasure in reporting an   increasing demand for laborers in different parts of this   mission, and in asking for at least Six more Elders, that   is, in addition to those already sent for, if two of them   could be of those who have been here and learned the native   language it will be all the better.    Opportunities for doing effective ^work^ among the Europeans of these   lands have, certainly, never been so good, during the last   12 or 15 years as at present.  Prejudice melts away much   more readily at the approach of truth than formerly and,   everything bids fair for a good seasons work.  Notwithstanding your kind response when asked for tracts we have   been much handicaped for the want of these convenient little   messengers to introduce us to the people.  and have ordered   several thousand from Liverpool.  but should you advise   us to go a head with the purchase of a press, I think that   in a short time this difficulty will be overcome.

As to their temporal condition  they are in the main rappidly becom-  ing poor which as long as they re-  main in this land I cannot regard  as being detrimental to their spiritual  advancement, as it forces them  to activity and lessens the^i^r opertu-  nities for evil associations.

Five ^six^ Elders will  be required by march and can return with the   "Monowai"  ^on her next trip,^ if the present boats keep on the line   in their present order.    On my arrival here   President Bingham told me that there was a   balance yet due ^you^ on an ammount   loaned this mission on publishing the Book   of Mormon but I find no account of   the same and would be obliged for a state-  ment of the acc't.

The construction  of the language has become quite  clear and words are coming to  me every day so that I can get  on full as well now as any of  the Elders left in the mission with  whom I am acquainted. Many  of the Elders who come here never  learn the language good and  some of them scarcely at all  as a rule those who are fluent  speakers in English succeed well   in the Maori.

Dear Brethren,    Elders Ridges, Young, and  Johnson arrived safely by the last Frisco Steamer. Elder  Ridges being appointed to the Australian district continued  his voyage by the same boat, after a five hours rest in Auckland.    We will require ^by return and mail,^ £60.0.0 as return fares of   Elders R. G. Miekle and D. B. Stewart whom we expect to   release to go home by the next departure of the "Monowai," which will be Decr 28th.    "The Ready References" have been prepared for publication   and placed in the hands of the printer, the first bound coppies   of which we may expect by the last of Decr. Money has   already been collected for the printing and by the time the first   lot is bound we will probably have enough in hand to   meet our obligations therefor. After the sale of the first   thousand ^coppies,^ it will be on a safe business footing.    We have agitated, to some extent, the purchasing of   a small printing press, for the purpose of issuing a paper   in the maori language, and, the printing of what tracts   we may need in the mission. The idea meets with univer- 
 doubt much better results would  attend their labors in this land;    The health of the Elders  here I believe is good without  an exception.

 sal favor among the natives and Elders. I think the   Saints here would subscribe quite liberally of their means   towards this end, both, for its establishment and maintenance,   however, we do not feel like moving out in this direction   without your advice, the more so as none of us have had   experience in this line of business. Should you feel to en-  courage the undertaking, providing it can be made self   supporting, any advice as to kind, size, and probable   cost of press, will be greatly appreciated. Upon the receipt   of your reply to this, if favorable, the mission will be im-  mediately canvassed and if the results warrant will proceed   at once to make arrangements etc., in which case we would want   a practical printer sent out, the younger the better, so he   could acquire the language, thereby, greatly increasing his useful-  ness.    The measles have swept over this country, and,   though, usually very fatal with natives, who are ignorant   of its nature and proper treatment, the mortality has been very   light indeed, as compared to its former visits to these Islands.    The general health now, of both Elders and Saints   is good so far as I am advised.    The "female franchise" and "local option" has made the   present session of N. Z. Parliament very lively and caused   a quite a ripple on the political sea of the colony and   I might say of Australasia. The success of the former   measure is now in accomplished fact, and may be   regarded as a very radical departure for a British Colony.   Of course, it had bitter opponents among the conservative class

The Six Elders  therein named had a very pleasant and speedy  voyage arriving here in good health on the 6th.    I anticipate releasing Elders Milton  Bennion and C. W. Taylor on Decr 25th to return  to Zion and therefore will need £60.0.0 for their  return fares, by return mail. The £180.0.0 mentioned  in your last came Safely to hand.    We will need  five ormore Elders by April and will probably be  best to have them come on the "S S Monowai" which  is expected to leave Sanfrancisco March 3rd 1893.

 only passing the upper House by a majority of 2. The  local option Bill will succeed, but no doubt, but in such a  form that but little good can expected from it.    Although this is a new country, "Strikes," "labour troubles"  and "unemployed" are not strangers here. Money has exercised a  far greater influence here in the settlement of this country, than,  what we have known, especially, in the western part of America.  Land monopoly, or the mopoly of the natural facilities,  make it an easy matter for Capital to dictate its own  terms, which means the enslavement of the masses. What a  contrast between this and the ^Spirit,^ method, and ultimate results  characterizing the settlement of the Saints in the once forbiding,  but now, beatutiful and happy vales of Zion.    These is a strong feeling growing here in favor of the  single tax system, so ably advocated by Henry George  of America and looking to the naturalization of the land.  The Gov't here are proceeding somewhat along those lines by  a system of a grauated land tax. The law being adjusted so that  the larger the holdings the greater their proportionate amount of tax.    Of course wise legislation may, to some extent, modify  existing evils, but, only modify, for their final abolition,  we must look to something that will tear from the heart  of man the incubus of selfishness an[d] hate; immerse int  in a solution that will dissolve its calloused surface which has  been formed by ages of accumulated wrongs and oppressions;  then, implant within it a love that is as broad as  humanity, and as induring as eternity; inspire it with a  knowledge of man's brotherhood and God's fatherhood,
