 so to hear of the lightness ofhis sentence. No wonder at therabid element getting more thanmad. We sincerely hope that theywill not be able to trumpup any other charge againsthim, so as to retain him intheir power. For we feel withyou that he with the leaders of Israel, are needed much tolabor in the midst of thepeople and give unto the Saintsthe word of the Lord, guidingand directing them in the path they ought to walkHow gladly the Saints will re-ceive their words of counciland instruction after having beenfor such a long time excludedfrom their midst. We feel that 
 shillings (the price of a book) to five pounds and upwards, and were entitled to receive copies without any fur-ther payments, yet so great what is their joy, that about eighty paid for their books five shillings each saying that they had joy in so doing, as it was their desire to assist in raising the balance yet due on the final payment that there might be a fund on hand for the publishing of other works, as they desire to receive all that God has revealed for the guidance and blessing of His children. When I was set apart for this mission, among other great promises and blessings that were pronounced upon me, was that means necessary to carry on this work should be raised in a mysterious manner, and surely this has been the case from the commencement until this time, for most of the means have come in quite a mys-terious manner, and as the payments have become due just enough to pay them, has been forthcoming, and for the last payment, the Saints have exceeded our most sanguine hopes or expectations. With this a statement will be furnished showing the receiptand disbursements in balance on hand which I feel will be most gratifying, for beside the balance of £80-12-5, we have collected £18-3-6 for the sale of books making a total of £98-15-11 so that all that is lacking is about fifty pounds. 
 You will also be most gratified to note the in-crease of souls during the past year. From statisti-cal report inclosed you will see that 513 have been baptized and 230 children blessed, making a total of 743 which is an increase of 237 over and above the year pre-vious. There have also been two districts or conferences or-ganized and fifteen branches, also ^22^ Sunday Schools; which with the large sum of money raised for the printing of the Book of Mormon, and that important work having been nearly completed, we are filled with thanks giving and praises unto the Lord our God; knowing as we do know, that it has all been accomplished by His divine guidance and wisdom, and as poor weak mortals we do not desire to take the least praise unto ourselves; ful-ly realizing that we have done no more than our duty. But by His aid and blessings, we have sought to mgag-nify our most high and holy callings as embassa-dors of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and fully real-ize that we have been wonderfully blessed and sustain-ed, having enjoyed the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.It is also most gratifying to us to be able to state that the prospects for the future are very encouraging indeed, and by the aid that we feel the Book of Mormon will be in aiding in the spreading of the Word of God, we feel that there will be a rich harvest of souls. Al-ready there have ^been^ over one hundred added to the fold 
 we would gladly travel manymiles to have the blessedprivilege of seeing and hearingthe Apostles of Christ.The Elders mentioned by youarrived at Auckland on the 10thinst in the enjoyment of healthhaving had a pleasant voyagesave the first day out fromSan Francisco, which was quiterough. Father Bromley looks quiteaged and feeble for such a longjourney. Yet he was feeling aswell as could be expected. Theywere appointed to labor as fol-lows: John H. Timpson, Waikato;Latimus O. Taft, Poverty Bay;Hugh S Geddes, Mahia;Joseph P. Beck, Hawkes Bay;We like their appearance much 
 and feel that they will makegood missionaries. Elder GeoE. Woolley felt some what castdown, on parting, with hisbrethren to continue his journeyto Australia. Judging from the shorttime I spent with him, I thinkhim a fine young man andspeak for him a useful lifethrough humility.By some means the Eldersdid not bring the tracts youstated would be sent to us.We sincerely hope they will comeby the Elders now on theirway here. It was very gratify-ing to receive instructions concern-ing the emigration of the "Maories"For we have written three timeson the same subject without 
 since the date of the report.The Elders are all quite well and enjoy a most excellent spirit and are returning to their various districts feeling that this has been by far the best con-ference ever held in this mission. In their appoint-ments and ^our^ council meetings, there was not a mur-mur, or a dissenting voice, but all expressed them-selves as feeling assured that the Lord had directed in all things. Five of the six Elders that left in March for this field of labor arrived in safety, were in attendance at our conference, and have now been assigned to their fields of labor. I like their ap-pearance much, and think they are well adapted for this mission. One of their number, Elder Geo.T. Smith, returned from San Francisco on account of poor health. While speaking of the Elders Iwill say that we feel blessed in having such a good faith-ful and obedient lot of boys, for such I call and claim them to be.Much might be said of our conference, the large gathering, quantity of food consumed, kind-ness of those not in the church, etc. but, as a full re-port will be furnished the Deseret News I will not take your valuable time by relating those items here: will simply say that the weather and all per-taining to the same was delightful. There was 
 nothing occurred to mar the peace and happiness of those present; but felt that we were in the enjoyment of the same Spirit that was with you in your con-ference.You will please send a remittance of nine-ty pounds (£90)on the Union Bank of Australia at Auckland for the return fares of Elders A. L. Stewart now laboring in Australia, who has not enjoyed the best of health during the two years he has been here, and we do not think it best wise to keep him here over another of the wet winters of Australia as his lungs and kidneys seem affected. Alexander Bullock, who has been here two years, a good faith-ful man, over fifty years of age. He has not been able to acquire the language, but has done all the good that laid in his power. And H. J. Burgess who has filled a faithful mission of 2 3/4 years. The two first named will most likely return in May, with a small company of Saints from Auckland. I will borrow the means for them, unless you have kindly responded to our last letter regarding the payment for the Book of Mormon. If so that can be used.  We have also directed Elder Wm Bromley to return home with Elder A. L. Stewart from Aust[ralia]. feeling that it would not be best for him to remain here over winter in his advanced age, he being over seventy 
 receiving any word until now. Wedid not know what answer togive to those so anxious to gather.But now, we feel that they willbe quite reconciled for a time,to wait until that suitable placeis selected for them. We will pre-sent it to them in the bestlight possible. We are sorry tohave to report another case ofhostility. This time it was withthe native Saints and not the Elders.Yet it occured at the sameplace that Elders Johnson andMagleby were tied up and keptprisoners for two days. Thechief and some of the leadingmen at this village are verybitter enemies to the Church.And recently some of his people 
 years old. The understanding was that his brother, whom he went to see, would pay his return fare; but, not having heard from him I do not know how it will be.There continues to be quite an enquiry among our dusky friends about their emigrating to Zion, feeling that they desire to get to the land of their forefathers where the Prophet and Apostles and the holy temples are, &c. We tell them to be patient, that this matter is before you, and in the due time of the Lord, the word will come for them to gather. This seems to satisfy them for a time, and then like children they will spring the same question again.The hireling priest of the day, both European and Native, are becoming quite alarmed about us, the Elders, being in their midst: and at a conference just held at the Bay of Islands, at which there were three archbishops present, they got up a petition with many signatures, and sent to parliament asking for a law compell-ing us to return, ^or leave the islands,^ and hindering any others from coming: setting forth that we are destroying the peace of the people; that before we came they were united in religious matters, but now we are causing them to leave the church of their 
 became convinced of the truth ofthe Gospel and embranced the same.This was done during a visitto other parts. So when theyreturned to their homes some ofthe people, led on by the chiefand a hirelying priest, commenced to affect them to endeavour to get them to leave the churchAmong other things they tiedbrother and his wife up fortwo days and nights. Also badlywhipped, knocked down and kickedanother brother and but for beingafraid of the laws of the landsno doubt would have killedthem. The guilty parties weresummoned before Judge Boothbut did not receive their just dues, as he, the Judge, is a 
 member of the Church of Englandand a friend to the minister.But on word being sent to Well-ington, the Government seat, con-cerning their proceedings we wereinstructed to take the next caseto the higher court, with apromise that we should receivejustice as they approved of ourlabours among the natives. Forwe are teaching them to keepthe laws of the land etc. We,therefore, do not look for anotheroccurrence of that kind, at leastat the same place.It is with hearts filled withthanksgivings and praises unto ourHeavenly Father, that we reportto you the condition of thisimportant mission. For we realize 
 of the Book of Mormon by the first returning Elders.Having now sufficient Elders we have direct-ed two from this conference, Elders N. S. Bishop andJos S. Groesbeck, to labor on the South Island, to endeav-or to open up the work amoung the Maories of that is-land. A native brother who has lived there has alsobeen appointed to accompany them.All the Elders at the conference unite in send-ing profound love and blessings, and ever prayingfor the richest blessings of Heaven to be yours to enjoy,that you may ever be fully adequate for everycircumstance which may arise, we remainYour Brother in the Gospel of Christ.Wm Paxman 
 that it is through the blessingsof God, and the ernest efforts of myco-labourers, that we are enabledto make such a favorable andgood report. In this the Bay ofIslands District, in which I amnow laboring and will be, theLord willing, for some time yet,there has been one hundred andtwenty five added to the Churchduring the past six weeks, andthe prospects are most encourag-ing for many more to come forth and enter into the Churchof Christ through the door ofbaptism, in the near future.Very favorable reports reach mefrom all the Districts and moreor less are being added to theChurch. In Australia the Elders 
 meet with a great amount ofopposition to encounter. And thereseem to be very few that carean iota about religion. They aremore lovers of pleasures than loversof God, their lives being theriches of the world. Still theElders labors with great diligenceand are doing all that liesin their power to warn thepeople. Sister Armstrong andfamily of five children, emigratedby the last mail steamer fromthat place. This makes it stillworse for the Elders, as that wastheir best and almost onlyhome. We have had five thous-and tracts printed entitled, "Goodtidings or the New and EverlastingGospel" by Jos. F. Smith for 
 that part and the Europeans uponthese Islands. So with the tractsyou are sending us we will bebetter prepared to warn the peopleand find the few honest in heartThe health of the Elders is good,as far as I now know. Andthere is general goods healthprevailing among the Saints.As was expected Elders H. J. Manning and M. S. Marriott wife and childand Sister Katie left for home bythe last mail steamer, as also a young sister, Charlotte Rowntree,and the six mentioned from Sydney. Elder Manning was ap-pointed to take charge of thecompany. They return with Hon-orable Releases having performedfaithful missions 
 Te Hauke, Hawks BayNew Zealand,July 3, 1888President Wilford Woodruffand Quorum of Apostles;Dear and beloved Brethren:Once more through the loving kindness of our Heaven-ly Father we are permitted to address you by letter, inanswer to your most welcome and highly appreciated fa-vor of the 24th of May, which reached us on the 30th ofJune, since which time it has been read and re-read with increased interest and joy, for we need not statethat our hearts were made to swell within us with rejoic-ings, and praises unto the Lord our God to know thatanother Temple had been dedicated unto the Most highGod, and made holy by His presence and acceptance, and by the rich out pouring of His Holy Spirit tofill every part thereof—even to the rejoicing of all thatwere permitted to enter its sacred portals, many of whom, I feel assured, heard and saw the marked manifestationsof Gods approval and acceptance of so beautiful anoffering from His covenant children. Your discriptionof its elegance and beauty of finish, making it so grandand pleasing to the eye, was very gratifying indeed.We could not helpp feeling in our hearts, Oh, that wemight have been present to have partaken of thoseblessed privilages, yet, feeling at the same time, that 
 As we may not be able to writeto you for some time, and inorder to give you time, willhere state, that we would liketo have four or five Elders forthis Mission arrive in Aucklandin March next. The steamerwill leave San Francisco aboutthe 8th of March.Elders J. E. Magleby and J. W. Kau-leinamoku, have now been hereabout three years and four monthsTherefore it will be right forthem to return home in earlySpring. They have filled most ex-cellent missions. So please sendthe means for their return fareson the Union Bank of Australiaat Auckland.We were much gratified to 
 we are just where Father wants us to be; therefore we arereconciled to labor with our might to bless this branchof the house of Israel. And we unite with you in theprayer that the Mighty One will ever preserve it fromthe hands of the wicked and the defilement of the unclean, that it may continue a house holy unto the Lord, in which the Saints may receive their blessings, & labor forthe redemption of their dead.Surely this will be an aditional strength to the Saints, in which we will have greater power with the heavens;God grant that it may be so.How rejoiced we were to learn of your brief stayin Juab Stake, and that we had a son that was worthyof your confidence and had the privilage of an inter-view with you; we had expressed a wish that you mighthave the privilage of dedicating the Temple beforeit was open to the public.The account given of the actions of the Receiver isnot so pleasing; they produce feelings of another kindfor we see in his actions the strong determination ofSatan to destroy the church of Christ, and afflict inevery possible way the saints of the Most High, andfeel if he can stop the glorious labor that is now beingdone in the Holy Temples, he will have gained a great victory.  Earnest prayers are being offered up in this thenethermost part of the earth, for the Lord to preserve thoseholy buildings from falling into the hands of our enemiesyet, at the same time we fully realize that all is in 
 the hands of the Lord, and that he will control all thingsfor the best, for, as you sayo beautifully say, come what will, it will not destroy the fact of revelation or theGospel being restored, and if we are faithful to them nopower can seperate us from the love of our Lord andMaster Jesus Christ.By the same mail that brought your letter we learnwith deep regret of the death of our beloved brother ApostleErastes Snow. Another noble spirit has gone to join withour illustrious prophets, apostles, patriarchs, and saintsthat have gone before, to intercede with the heavenly hostsin the behalf of the saints left behind.The seven Elders mentioned by you, arrived at Aucklandin safety on the 23 of June, feeling well in spirits, and havebeen assigned to their fields of labor as follows: Jas. S. Nye, Hawks Bay; R. Gibbons, Poverty Bay; Walter S. Reid, Bay of Islands; Jos. S. Dame, Waikoto; Jos. N. Haywood, Mahia; John S. Bingham, Waiapi;and Thos. C. Young, Hauraka districts, the last three toteach school, and in a short time Elder Reid willalso teach school in the Bay of Islands.In relation to our day-schools, we will here state that weare careful not to organize them, only in such parts wherethere are no Government schools within reach of the child-dren, and where there are a number of children growing up inignorance, for we see it will be a labor to keep them up;however, it affords the Elders this teaching, an opportunityof acquiring the language, and fitting them for the 
 learn of the success of thework of the Lord upon theSamoan Islands and trust thatthe interest may continue.Also very thankful to know thatthe new judges are acting withmore justice and consideration to-wards the Saints. And do sin-cerely trust that the samespirit may continue to be mani-fested. We learn from the papersthat the Supreme Court of theTerritory has decided against usin the property suit. That is asgood as we could naturally expectfrom that body. But we sincerelyhope that that ^the^ Supreme Court of the U States may have eyes to see andears to hear, that justice may bedone. We are well in health 
 missionary field, for as a general thing an educationaids much in acquiring the language: where ever theschools have been started we find the children veryquick toin learning.We are also organizing Sunday Schools in all thebranches where we have sufficient children, and canfind suitable material for the officers; quite an interestis manifested in the same, by old and young, and wefeel they will be the means of doing much good.In the coming fall it will be time for the follow-ing named Elders to be released to return home, viz.Sandra Sanders Jr, it being now three years since heleft home, H. J. Manning, and M. S. Marriott andSister Georgena Marriott, as it will make three yearsfor them by that time, they have all filled most ex-cellant missions, doing all that layed in their power toaid in the saving of souls, and the warning of the peopleof the great and terrible day of the Lord. Elder Sandershas labored faithfully for upwards of a year upon thetranslation of the Book of Mormon. Please send thedraft for their return fares, on the Union Bank ofAuckland ^Australia^, at AucklandElders J. E. Magleby and J. W. Kauleinamoko came hereat the same time as Elder Sanders, but as we meed themto assist in the opening up of new districts, being shortof Maori linguists, they are willing to remain untilspring.We would be most pleased to have (6) six

The printing of theBook of Mormon is progressing nicely.We desire to have it completed byour April Conference. Though themeans is coming in rather slowlyat present.Ever praying for the choicestblessings of God our Eternal Fatherto be yours. That you may beadaquate to every emergencyWith profound and sincere love inWhich Elders Geo Romney Jr. andE. Mangleby, who I am now with,join. I am now as everYour Brother in the Gospel of Christ.Wm Paxman 
 Elders for this mission, if it could be arranged forthem to leave San Francisco by the steamer that sailsfrom there on the 17 of October. I could meet them on their arrival at Auckland, as, the Lord willing, I will be there at that time on my way to the Bay ofIslands, the extreme north end of the Island: iftwo or three of that number had an aptitude to teachschool we would be thankful.We are now extending our labors more among the Eu-ropeans, than we have done before, and by the blessingsof the Lord there has been quite a few baptized, but welabor unde[r] a disadvantage in not having a suply of tractsfor them, and, having the publishing of Book of Mormon onhand, we dare not ask for means out side of that. TheTithing that comes in is but very small, hardly suffic-ient to meet the small current expenses. If some ofour brethren that have made fortunes in a day, by sellingtheir inheritences, could be induced to send out a few thous-and tracts, treating on the first principles of the Gospeletc., we could make excellant use of them, and they wouldthereby be preaching the Gospel by the printed word; thetracts could be sent by the coming Elders without anyexpense.Since our last letter to you, gratifying words havereached us from the Mahia, Hauraka and Bay of Island districts of the aditions to the Church by baptism, therehave also been aditions in this the Hawks Bay district ofboth Europeans & natives, and the prospects for the fu- 
 c/o James Hay,Cobden StreetNewton, Auckland,New Zealand.May 8th 1889President Wilford Woodruff.Dear and much beloved Brother.We are just in receipt of your most esteemed favorof the 1st of April, which was read and reread withdeep interes,.  And we feel greatly blest to receiveso much of your attention and kind consideration, andwas indeed blest in our feelings to learn of the goodhealth of yourself and those of the Apostles. As also tolearn of the prosperety and welfare of Zion in allof her department. It was most gratifying tolearn of the grand success of the Church Schools noworganized, as also of the bright prospects of othersbeing started in the near future.We feel assured that you had a glorious time duringyour conference, and we sincerely hope thatamong the "important items of buisness transadid"that the First Presidency was organized, as wefeel that the Church is much stronger with allher quorums fully organized, and how blestwe as saints are, for your life having beenpreserved upon the earth to direct the affairsof God upon His foot stool, having been sofamiliar with the Church of Christ from 
 the beginning, Surely the Lord has had apurpose in thus preserving you with all yourmental and physicial faculties to such a ripeage.  And may God's choice blessings ever bewith you and those associated with you, is themany earnest prayers that are offered up byour dusky friends, as also the Elders.We with you sincerely desire that our en-emies will not prevail with Prest Harrisonin getting our most bitter enemies appoin-ted to fill the various offices of the Territory.We are indeed verry grateful for your kin-dness in loaning the $500, asked for, thatwe might be able to meet our obligationsincured in the printing of the 2,000 copiesof the Book of Mormon in Maori: and feelexceedingly thankful for the same.And we are truly happy to be able to statethat we are in a possition so that we willnot need to use more then $200 of theamount sent, as we stated in our lettersent to you by the last mail. So if youhave not sent the £90 - asked for, on therecept of this, please do not send only£30 and credit us with the $300, and theLord willing it will be but a short timebefore we will be able to refund theremaining $200, as the Natives are 
 future look fully as favorable as at any time in thepast; for, although the ministers of the various churchesare doing all that lay in their power against the work ofGod among our dusky friends, calling their chiefs togetherto poisen their minds etc., they do not succeed as they wouldlike, for they generally find some of our Elders or Saints torebut their statements and stand up in our favor, giving the natives a chance to see the differance between p Priesthoodand Priestcraft, and in many cases doing more good thanharm, for they overstep all bounds of reason, and tellsuch barefaced falshoods that even the natives can de-tect them.On my return from the South, I found Elder S. Sandersand Sister Katie in the enjoyment of health, and about fin-ishing the writing of the MSS, ready for the reading beforeour Maori brethren, as soon as they can get there.Elder Marriott wrote me a few days ago asking ifthere would be any objections of one of our Native Sistersemigrating to Zion, the only objection I see in the wayis, that others will desire to follow in the same way, forit will not do to extend to one any liberties that cannot begiven to all as they are so peculiar in this respect, so muchlike children we have to be exceedingly careful in everymovement we make with them, and with their limitedexperience in the Gospel, and their natural desire to im-itate after the evils. Fears are entertained by us thatsome of them might partake of the bad element ofour once peaceful cities and report back the amount 
 anxious to get the books to read, and in afew days we will have another 500 copiesready for sale.  We have indeed beenblest in this labor.Now dear President, regarding  your enquiries."Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now withyou whom you can recommend to succeed youwhen you are released to return home, or do youthink it will be necessary or desirable that someElder specially called to preside in Australasia besent from here?"  We will here state, thatwe have two Elders that in my judgmentwould be suitable to fill this possition, namelyAngus. T. Wright of Ogden, who has been here1 1/2 years.  And J. S. Bingham of Clifton, Ida-ho, who is a counciler to the Bishop of thatWard, he has been here one year the 23rd ofnext month, they are both good men, and wou-ld do all that laid in their power to furtherthe work of God in this land.  I fear how-ever that the first named would not beable to endure so much horse back ridingas is required of the president of this mission,as he is enclined to be stout and riding tomuch on horse back seem to hurt him.At our anual conference, last month,they were both appointed to preside oververry important districts, those that had 
 of wrong doing there is in the midst of the saints, such as drinking, smoking, swearing, Sabbath-breaking etc., which would spread from one end ofthe Island to the other, thereby doing much harm.It might be well to here state that our dusky friendsare exceedingly fond of all sports and ammusements, such as horse races, billiards, foot ball, foot-races, etc., andit would not require but a small exertion on their partto follow after all such things. Our feelings are thatwhen they emigrate, there should be a suitable locationfor them to gather to, that they might be together, as alltheir work now is done on the United order principle;they will not work, live, eat or sleep alone, and they arenot ever fond of work, but if properly directed they cando a great deal of work. Having thus given our feelings inbrief, we will be pleased to receive and carry out anysuggestions or instructions you may deem best to giveon this matter.There is general good health prevailing in the midst ofthe saints, there has been no time since our arrival herethat the saints have been so free from sickness. The health of the E[l]ders and Sisters is also good, for whichwe feel exceedingly thankful to our Heavenly Father.We were rejoiced to learn of your good health andhave a great desire that it may so continue, for wesee to a limited extent the great labors that are uponyou in these very trying times as also the intenseanxiety. Earnest, yet humble prayers are con 
 been somewhat neglected for the wantof suitable Elders to preside over them.  And if eith-er of them were called, we would not knowjust how to fill up the vacency and do justiceto the district, yet, if you are led to appointone of them we could get along some how,but, if a good wise fatherly Elder couldbe sent from home, it might be good, asit would give him a longer time topreside, and leave these districts mentionedin a better condition.This mission is quite large and is stillgrowing.  It now take about a year togo over the same, attending conferences,etc.   We have a great desire, and feelsure that the ^right^ one will be appointed, forthis is a verry peculiar people to handle,and by the blessings of the Lord we now havetheir love and confidance.Elder A. L. Stewart, will return home witha small company of European saints, bythe steamer that bring this to you, he isa good faithful worker and have prefor-med a good mission of two years; thelast one being in Australia.With him I will send copies of theBook of Mormon in Mauri for yourselfand Prests George Q Cannon and Jos. F. Smith.

 two of our clerks have left us; Bro. Grimshaw cannot standMormonism any longer—or the hard times, and he has left for England on his own hook, and Bro Bullock has been calledby President Young to go on a Mission to England, so there are none now, but Leo, Robert and myself, but we shall do the best we can. We have got through with the history of Joseph up to his death, unless you give us something more in answer to the letter we sent you by the last mail, to fill up some blanks &c. We shall next commence upon the History of Brigham Young &c.There is nothing very strange with us, all is peace and quietness with us while the strom is raging in the lower world, the only thing we have heard of late to create any excitement at all, and that but little was that Troskalawski one of the U. S. Surveying party had been damning the people and boys, and calling them, in the streets anythinghe could think of. One evening while calling the two Mechams"God damned Mormon sons of Bitches" they pitched him downinto the ditch and gave him a thrashing, and it has been saidthat Gen. Burr was going to leave in consquence of it but ithas not made much stir.Your family are well, as is the case with the families of all the brethren who are there. We are going a head with the Agricultural and Manufacturing interest; the Hands aretaking the matter up, in this city, and becoming Auxiliarybranches of the Society, and are going into the Manufacturing business as far as possible, we have it to do, as the money is nearly all gone out of the Territory. There is a general council and feeling through this Territory to retrench ourexpenses at the Stores and make all that we have to use, as faras we can.

We have eager-ly scanned the newspapers on the arrival of our mails to learn if possible the decision on pend-ing cases. We really have no fear 
 servants and highly favored mouth pieces.I am pleased to report that five Elders reachedhere in safety, enjoying good health, and having had a very pleasant voyage.One of them, Bro. A. L. Young was selected to con-tinue on to Australia, to labor under the direction of Elder Geo E. Woolly who now has charge of that field of labor. The balance of the company were appointed to various fields on this Island.While on this subject I wish to enquire what to do in the case of Bro. William Bromley,who is now laboring in 
 for the final outcome of the cause of God, but we certainly would like to see our rights respected more, and ^the^ spirit of the law ad-ministered with more equity and justice.We are now anxioulsly awaiting to hear the results of the City election.Having had an unpleasant experience with our unscrupu-lous opponents we cannot help having grave fears that they may have worked their nefar-ious schemes there and gained the day.We enclose with this the six months report, also one for the past year and trust they will reach you in time for the general conference.As our labors and conferences

Is he considered the same as a regularly called elder? that is, sub-ject to my directions, awaiting a release from me, and entitled to the usual amount for his fare?I was informed that the mission was his own choice, and got the impres-sion that he would return at his pleasure, and con-sequently, with his own means. When I met Pres.Chipman he made en-quiries respecting him which leaves me in doubt.He also stated that the old gentleman was failing quite fast, and should be released as he would be 
 have been reported to the News we will not enter into them again, but will state that we find the saints generally feeling well, and desirous of living up to the principles of Salvation.

 better off among friends at home.There will probably be no Elders returning though before October, and I don't think it advisable for the old gentleman to undertake the journey alone. There is a prospect of having another small company of emigrating Saints by that time.In your latest communi-cation, you speak as though there may be some elders following. I will be very glad indeed to get them, or at least two more which will make up the number I asked for, and fill existing vacancies.I find it ne^ce^ssary to keep

 up the full compliment of Elders, in order to have qualified speakers to take charge of dis-tricts.In my communication of March 19th, I recommended that four new Elders be notifed forto this field to arrive here in Sept., or Oct. Please notify five instead of four,to reach here at the time stated.We have started again on our tour of inspection or visits among the various districts of the mission, and thus far have found the Saints feeling well in the Gospel, and no more than the usual amount of troubles to settle. 
 As the winter rains have begun, and earlier too than usual, traveling is made disagreeable and in some parts impossible on account of the heavy floods which are quite common to the country.We continue to enjoy good health, as do all of the Elders, and nothing more serious than an occasional attack of the Gripps, or slight cold has troubled any of us for some time. Were we not satisfied that the prayers of our dear ones and the Saints generally are heard by our Heavenly Fatherand that we are preserved by Him, it would seem 
 almost miraculous the way in which we are enable to stand the inconveniences of the Mission and the changeableness of this climate.Praying for the success of Zion and the health and prosperity of her inspired leaders, I am your obedient servant,Angus T.

 could in a written communi-cation. I will just say that our district, and the annual conferences were all that we could expect, and were in ev-ery way successful.We continue to have an occasional European con-vert, and the Elders could use some European tracts to very good advantage, if you would kindly favor us again by send-ing another lot of them.As Elder Stevenson had intended returning by Europe, but having changed his mind, he has a surplus of money; and not caring to carry so much across with him, has deposited fifty (50) 
 sionaries at as early a date as March, for the work continues to grow, new fields are opening, and additional Elders will be needed. The five Elders which I wrote for last mail, please send as soon as convenient, in addition to the two sailing in March.Your instructions concern-ing the general fast day were received, but not till after the day appointed had passed. We however, realizing also the benefit of prayer, set apart one of the days of our conference when we fasted and offered our feeble supplications to the Throne of Grace in behalf of Zion gener-ally, and her leaders in par-ticular. It was a day of rejoic- 
 I think it advisable to sendsome one well versed inthe principles of the Gospel; ofgood judgment, and a manof experience in presiding orsitting in judgment on diff-icultys arising among memb-ers of the Church.Owing to their peculiar marr-iage relations their weaknessesand great adaptability tofollow after the sins and folliesof their wicked European nei-ghbors, curious and compli-cated cases arise which, as one Elder said, would takethe patience of Job and thewisdom of Solomon to settle, as the Elders here are allyoung men and before

Truly we had a time of rejoicing and we have not experienced a richer flow of the spirit of testi-mony since we have had the pleasure of laboring among this peculiar people. Many of the Elders have also been unusually blessed in acquiring the language, one in particular, who bore his testimony quite intelligently in the native tongue after a residence of but four weeks among them. The manifestations which we are almost daily receiving are a source of great consolation to us,

If you will kindly order the equivalent of this amount paid to him there, you will favor me very much.I am pleased to say that the Elders are all well, and laboring dilligently for the salva-tion of souls.I will not add more at present, as Bro Stevenson will tell you the news.The two Elders who were expected last month did not arrive.

I submit these suggestionsbecaus I realize this is alarge, important, and veryexpensive mission; beleivingthat its future success depe-nds largely on the capabilitiesand influence of the presidingofficer, and also through mygreat desire to see it continueto grow and prosper.Our yearly Conference willconvene April 4th, at which we anticipate a large turn-out and a good profitabletime; preparation's are being

Z.Dec 26th 1889.President Wilford Woodruff andBrethren of the Council,My Dearly Beloved Leaders:I again take pleasure in addressing a few words to you, toreport our condition and requirements in this remote partof the Lords Vineyard. I am pleased to state first thatElders. Thos. C. Stanford, P. P. Thomas, L. J. Hawkes, M. Bennion, and O. C.Dunford and wife arrived safely and in good health andspirits, by the last mail boat having had a pleasant andcomparatively smooth passage. While on this subject, Iwill say that I think it would be best to discourage theElders from bringing their wives with them to this fieldof labor, for really it is not a suitable place, nor have weproper accommodations for our sisters.I was somewhat surprised at not getting noticefrom you of their coming, nor even a letter with them,and it was only by chance that I heard of their comingand averted what might have been quite an inconvenienceto them, as it is almost absolutely necessary for some one tomeet them here to assist them in making necessary pur-chases. etcWill you be kind enough to send me about five morenew Elders for this field, to fill the places of those which

We feel to say am-en to your testimonies regardingthe final result of the work ofGod.We thank the Lord that the saintsare once more privileged to listento your inspired concsels, andknow they appreciate them aswe shall do when once more al-lowed that great blessing. Wefeel to rejoice to know that weare remembered in your sup-plications to the throne of ourMaker, and can assure youthat fervent prayers are dailyoffered by the Elders and saintsin this far off land, for yourcontinued peace, health andgeneral prosperity. 
 will be released in April. If they could come on theboat which leaves San Francisco about April 5th, it wouldbe most convenient; if that is too short notice, please sendby boat leaving second or third of May.If you will kindly notify me a mail in advance Iwill appreciate it very much. I would like to haveat least two of them qualified for school teaching, andif I may be permitted to suggest, I would say, thatwhen selecting Elders for this field it would be wellto remember that they have a new and difficult languageto learn, and all books issued as helps to the learner, areon a grammatical basis, and therefore Elders who haveno knowledge of grammar, find the study very irksomeand the acquiring of the language almost impossible,consequently very discouraging to themselves and thenative saints who are expected to provide for them.The Lord has wonderfully blessed many of us, inour comparative ignorance of our own tongue, "Butall have not the same gifts, though directed by the same spirit" [##Doctrine and Covenants 46:11##] [##1 Corinthians 12:4##]With regard to the Australian part of our field oflabor we have but two there whom we can dependupon as laboring Elders, the third one (Brother Bromley)is visiting relatives, and as one of them, Brother Chip-man, will be released in April, it will perhaps benecessary to send some elders there. That is if it isintended to continue the mission. I suppose though 
 Since my appointment to the high and responsible position asPresident of this mission, acalling which I by no meansfeel capable of magnifying, I havebeen attending conferences andlaboring among the outsiders inthe extreme Northpart of theIsland.I am sorry to say that our labors were not crowned withmuch success, owing princi-pally to the united and persist-ant efforts of the clergy. Theyare continually warning thepeople against us, and in so-me withplaces we could withdifficulty get places to sleep,and having in many instances,the doors closed in our faces.The Maories are naturally ahospitable people, but the lies 
 that President Paxman has reported its conditions, andsuggested to you its requirements.From a recent letter received from Elder Chipman,he represents the people as being very indifferent, andthat after thoroughly advertising in daily papers, post-ing circulars etc., that but perhaps three or four strangerswould come to their hall, and it reminded usforcibly of our late experience in trying to interest theEuropeans of Auckland and suburbs. He reportsbut one baptism in the past three months.I am pleased to report that the work progresses favor-ably in this part of the mission, though we havemany things to contend with, the natives being soweak, and we are occasionally obliged to take actionagainst members for their persistent evil practices,and particularly for their running after the Moaripriests, or workers in witchcraft and Moari superstitionsWe recently visited a small neighboring island andGod so blessed us that we were permitted to add 52souls to the fold. We were met and opposed by satanwho took possession of one of the females there, butby the power of the priesthood of God, and in thename of his Son, he was cast out, the afflicted personbaptised, and we all rejoiced in the great testimonywhich was given to us.From our home papers we learn of the excellent

I really feel,from my acquaintance and associations withhim, that he will fully appreciate and dulymerit the salvation which is now offeredhim through his repentance.I was pleased also to learn that two more Elders were on their way to this field oflabor; I will have one of the brethren meetand welcome them to Maoridom.There was one question I askedin my communication of March 19th, inregard to half-caste Maories emigrating

 He, in connection with othersof the elders, has exercisedmuch faith, administeredto ordinances, but withoutthe desired effect.He has beencheerful through all his afflictions and will leave manywarm friends behind amongthe maori saints.

Theyare no exception, for they get the spirit of gather-ing, as do their white brethren, on theirobedience to the principles of the Gospel.Praying God to abundantly bless you

 (Recd 22 Dec. 1890.)J. S. BinghamAhipara, Nov. 20, 1890.Prest Wilford Woodruff, Box B. Salt Lake City:Dear Brother:It affords me pleas-ure to again write you, and I am thankful to be able to re-port myself and the Elders in good health.Since writing to you from Tautoni, I in company with Elders Nye and Cutler, have been down to the extreme north end of the island, visiting all of the native villages, and have had the priv-ilege of bearing our testimony to many who had never before seen a Mormon Elder. As a rule we were kindly received, and attentively 
 listened to, but in some places they were so bitterly prejudiced by mendacious reports circulated among them by our enemies that they would not allow us to hold meet-ings. Wherever we could get a hear-ing, I think we allayed much of the prejudice and left the people more favorably impressed with what the world calls Mormonism.At one place a European and several natives desired baptism, but as we did not think the na-tives sufficiently enlightened, we advised them to wait till some future visit of the elders.There are some fine people in this section, and I trust that they will eventually accept the truth.We are now at the house of a Half Caste who has a European 
 wife and a large family. Tomorrow we shall have the pleasure of lead-ing him into the waters of baptism, and his wife being quite favorable, we hope in time to baptize them all.Since writing I have heard from most of the presidents of districts.Several excommunications, are reported but no baptisms showing that the adversary is still at work; not only in hardening the hearts and blinding the minds of the outsiders; but also in leading astray those who have been initiated into the truefold.I have not heard from the breth-ren in Australia since Prest. Wright's return.Elders Heywood, Young, Nye and Dame will be released to return home 
 next April. Please send us two new elders to take their place. The mission is well supplied with elders at present, but I think it best for two to come and be acquiring the language, as another company will be released about next OctoberA report is going the rounds at present to the effect that a manifesto forbidding the practice of polygamy has been issued by the President of the Mormon Church; and ratified by a mass meeting of 15,000 Mormons. The newspapers are all commenting upon it, and we are every-where plied with questions concerning it. Having heard nothing authentic, we treat this as a rumor of the same nature as the hundreds of others which are continually being put in circulation concerning us, still we 
 would be pleased to learn from you whither ^any^ action has been taken to give foundation to such a report?The spring has been unusually cold and stormy, but it is now fine, and becoming quite warm. The prospect is that crops will be good, and the na-tives will have plenty of food next win-ter.They are most all at home at this season of the year and it is an excellent time for the Elders to travel among the outsiders, but as soon as the season of cultivation is is over they scatter out into the gumfields, and it is hard to reach them. We could not have chosen a better time for our visit to this end, as wherever they would receive us at all we had crowded housesThere have been some riots of late 
 among the natives of what is known as the King Country, and several who are guilty of plundering stores etc., have been arrested and are now in custody. We are in hopes that something will transpire to lessen the influence of King Tawhio and Te Kooti, the Maori Prophet, so that their followers will accept the gospel. As it is at present they are so carried away by foolish vagaries that they will not listen to anything rea-sonable.The health of the Saints I believe is generally good. Many are trying to live their religion, and are mak-ing commendable progress in the knowledge of the gospel, while others I am sorry to say are yielding to temptation, and returning to their "wal-lowing in the mire." 
 Some are becoming anxious to go to Kiona, (Zion), but I think it quite wise to help them here until they provethemselves worthy.There are, no doubt, a few worthy persons who, surrounded as they areby the contaminating influences of the world, yield to temptation, while under more favorable circumstances they might perhaps endure faithful; but in my opinion there are many more who would eventually fall away even were they permitted to emigrate, and it is far better to purge them out and have them here than to take them to Zion. There is too much dross there already. I find that many have been baptized without a knowledge of the gospel, and my experience is that it is more difficult to convert a person after baptism than before. 
 Most of the European Saints are la-boring with a view to going to Utah, but some of them are in very poor circumstances being destitute of all comforts, and having barely sufficient to sustain life.I will not weary you further. Hoping to hear from you soon, and continually praying for the onward progress of truth and right-eousness, I remain as everYour Brother in Christ, J. S. BinghamAddress, General P. O. Auckland 
 Tantoru Oct. 25 1890Prest. Wilford Woodruff,Box B.,Salt Lake City.Dear Brother:It now becomes my pleasant duty to write you,and inform you of my whereabouts.Your letter informing meof my appointment to the presi-dency of the Australasion Missioncame to hand by due course of mailand was, it is useless to say, a greatsurprise to me. I feel very weak inhaving to assume so great respon-sibility, but I sincerely hope andtrust that God in His infinitemercy will bless me with wis-dom, and bestow upon me all 
 other qualifications requisite to theproper performance of all laborsand duties connected with the management of His affairs inthis land, as I earnestly desire tomagnify my calling acceptably andfor the interest of the mission.Since the departure of Prest. Wrightand companions for home, I havebeen traveling in the Bay of IslandsDistrict in company with Elders Nyeand Hixson. We have had thepleasure of baptizing eight persons.On account of scarcity of food andfor other reasons we thought it notadvisable to hold any conferences in this part of the island, so I amtraveling through the districts visit-ing the branches and speakingto the people as opportunities are af-forded. It seems that gleaning and 
 sifting is the process at present, asall of the natives have all heardthe testimony of the Elders, and itis quite difficult to awaken anyinterest.The Elders I believe are allin good health. Sister Dunford atlast account was also well and per-forming her dutises as teacher quitesatisfactorily. The school is wellpatronized, the present enrollmentbeing forty five.Prest. Wright with the compa-ny of Elders and Saints I supposewill arrive at San Francisco today,and ere this reaches its destinationyou no doubt will have had aninterview with him and learnedof the general condition of affairsin the missionBro. Geo. E. Woolley having la- 
 bored in Australia for two years,will be released to return homein January. Plese send by re-turn mail a check for thirty poundsto pay his return fare.In replying to this, please ad-dress me at Shortland, Thames,Hauraki, and the month ^following^ atGeneral P.O.

The weather thus far thiswinter has not been so coldand stormy as it was lastwinter, and there has beenless sickness and deathamong the natives, thougha few have succumbed tola grippeI very much regret to 
 report the release of Elder[redacted]for misconduct.He through the weaknessof the flesh yielded to thetemptation of the adversary, andmade improper overtures to ayoung Maori woman. He didnot commit himself, but ac-cording to his own confessionwould have done so had a favorable opportunity pre-sented itself. He seems fullyto realize the gravity of his mis-take, and is suffering the mostbitter remorse. It is a most de-plorable affair, and is some-thing that has been carefullyguarded against ever sincethe opening of this missionamong the Maori people aswe fully realized how disas- 
 astrous it would be to the causeof truth should any of the elders be found guilty of a violation of the law of chas-tity among this simple-mindedand confiding people, but thelong dreaded evil has at lastbefallen us. Just how detrimen-tal this sad affair will provewe at present cannot tell, butI fear that it will be some-time before we regain thatimplicit confidence whichthe natives have hitherto placedin us as servants of the Lord.We shall endeavor as wehave ever done to show in themost emphatic way possi-ble our disapproval of suchconduct, and fervently prayto God to counteract theevil influence that the

 Our annual conference wasa most enjoyable one. Nine-teen Elders, Sister Dunford andabout five hundred natives werepresent. The Spirit of the Lordwas bestowed in rich abundance, and harmony and goodfeeling raeigned. The Elders areunanimous in saying that itwas the best conference that theyhave attended in this land.A few of the saints were sick,but our Heavenly Father inHis tender and loving mercyheard and answered our sup-plications in their behalf, andthey were raised up fromtheir beds of affliction. Oneyoung ^man^ who was very bad, andto whom we administered sev-eral times during conference, came 
 to prayers the next morningafter its close and participatedin the services by announcingand leading the hymn.Owing to so many ^elders^ havingreturned home before their mis-sions were fulfilled we findourselves with an insufficient number of Maori linguists, andI was much perplexed in ma-king the appointments, but throughthe guidance of the Holy SpiritI arranged them in a way thatI trust will be satisfactory andfor the good of the cause.Elders Rasmussen, Gibson and Douglass reached this land insafety, and in time to be presentthe last two days at conference.The vacancies are all filled,in fact we have too many

In my opinion, therefore,it will be better for the interestsof the Mission ^if^ some person of wisdom and experience be sentfrom home to take the presidency,especially if one could be sent whois already familiar with the Maorilanguage.At our Semi annual Con-ference held on January 9, 10, 11, ElderHeber S.

 been disqualified one day through sickness.At this season of the yearthere is usually a great deal of sickness among the natives occasioned by exposure to cold and dampness, but thus far there has been but little a-mong the saints.I was much pleased to hear of the appointment of Elder Wm. T. Stewart to the presidency of the Australasian Mission.  I think it a wise selection and one that willgive universal satisfaction a-mong the Maori saints.  By them Bro. Stewart is held in high es-teem, and they never weary of speaking of his many merits.I think it will be best for 
 for a while, but at last accounts wasimproving. Elder J. H.

Having notracts with which to work at present,they are at loss to know how toproceed.

 When Prest. Wm. Paxman was laboring here, the harvest was great and many laborers were meeded, but since that time the harvest seems measurable to have passed, and at present there is but little desire on the part of out-siders for the gos-pel and little opportunity to labor among them.The mission is divided in-to districts or conferences, with towo or three elders in each district.  Some of these districts are quite small with no apparent prospect of becom-ing any larger, and the el-ders being compelled to spendmost of the time among the saints, become rather bur-densome.

I am confident thatas much would be accom-plished, and the elders wouldlabor with more satisfac-tion to themselves and thesaints.

But while we mournhis loss, there is great consola-tion in the assurance thathaving kept the faith andfought the good fight, he hasgone to the realms of bliss where 
 he can rest from the toils andtrials of the the flesh while heenjoys the society of holy menof God, and mingles his voicein council with those who havepreceded him to the mansionsof our Heavenly Father.I am pleased to state thatthe Elders are in the enjoymentof sufficient health and strengthto be able to perform their du-ties. Elder J. H. Burton, whom Imentioned in my last as beingquite ill, is now much betterand is pursuing his labors as usu-al. I think he is troubled withasthma, and this heavy dampatmosphere is quite severe onhim at times, but I trust thatby being cautious he will be a-ble to remain until his mis-sion is fulfilled which is his 
 earnest desire.Your letter of Oct. 15, 1890 hasnot come to hand, and conse-quently I did not received anyinstruction concerning the re-lease of Elder Wm. Bromley un-til receipt of your last. I haveborrowed £30 to pay the expen-ses of his return, and have senthim his release. Owing to a de-lay in the transfer of the mon-ey, I think he will not be ableto start home until June.I do not know of any one to ac-company him. I have written El-der Cutler to advise him to waittill he can have company ifhe thinks it unsafe for him togo alone.You did not state whetheryou sent a check for his returnfare. 
 News from Australia is stillsomewhat encouraging. Infor-mation has been received from ElderCutler of a few new baptisms, andprospects are favorable for the per-formance of more work. On this is-land also the Europeans are beginning to accept our testimony. Withinthe last month eleven have beenbaptized, and many others areinvestigating.

D. Haight whosailed Feby 27, John H Burton who sailed Apl 23rdand Jos S. Groesbeck who left for home by way ofEurope on 30th of last month; These Elders haveall filled good missions in this land. In returningthem I had to borrow of Bro. Hardy £40, whichwith the £50 which was sent me some monthsago made up the Sum. I hope it will not belonger than another month till I can pay him.Enclosed please find the StatisticalReport of this Mission which I have not at presentan opertunity of comparing with the last one, butwill say that it like previous ones contains nameswhich should be eliminated to the extent of consider-ably reducing the total, by increasing ^the^ deaths & excom-munication totals, as numbers who have been baptized have went off and never returned, havingeither died or apostatized, but it will be sometime before this can be regulated so that the reports 
 will correspond closely with our exact numbers.Our Anual conference was heldat Te Rahui Waiapu Valley which is at the Eastcape.The Southren districts were well represented, but onlythe Elders came from the northren. Our meetingswere well attended the large carved Maori housebeing crowded in nearly every meeting. It washeld on the 8th 9th and 10th of April. From the reportsand my personal acquaintance can say, thatwhile the numbers in the mission have been decreas-ing, yet many of the Saints are increasing theirfaith and diligence and are not near the childrenin understanding they were upon coming in to thechurch, anvery many of them have kept themselvesStraigt. I am happy to say, since they first receivedthe Gospel, and give promise of being so unto the endand Shows the results of the good labors in this landnot only of those "who planted", but those who havebeen "watering", as well as manifesting the Graceof "God who giveth the increase" and is a source ofJoy and thanksgiving to those who labor here.We have been much troubled with the vice of gambling,^especially on horse races,^ amongst this people, and where they have been dealtleniently with in this matter it has generally resultedin drunkeness, adultery, etc. In endeavoring tostop it, some have been excommunicated, where they 
 have defiantly persisted therein, in the district wherethe latter course has been pursued and it hasbeen nipped in the bud, success has seeminglyattended, and this evil is well under hand ^in those districts^ at presentAnd the Elders generally feel that it is the bettercourse to pursue. Yet our home mail bringsnews that this evil is rappidly on the increase at home,and those indulging therin, does not seem to becalled in question; In fact it appears that somewho should be examples to the people because oftheir position's are leading they way. And the questionnaturally arises in our minds, wether we arejustifed in dealing with this people for this offence,when it is not a question of fellowship with the^more experienced^ Saints in Zion.The Saints here were anxious tohave the Doctrine & Covenants translated into theirlanguage, but when I gave them your adviceupon it they seemed willing to let it rest, butasked if the Ready Reference could not be printedin their language I told them I would refer thematter to you. And will added that if it wasprinted with the Book of Mormon references, whichare in small type figures in the compendium, itwould no doubt be of much benefit to themand to the Elders laboring here. 
 In Australia four Elders are laboring, but withlittle success further than keeping a live thefew members in that vast country, and warningthe wicked inhabitants thereof. Two labor in victoriaand two in Queesland and at last report ^in^ both placesthey were keeping bachelors hall when at head quarters.The few Saints in that land appear to be very poor andscattered, and the greater part of them very week in thefaith. And it is really questionable in my mindwhether we ought to keep that part of the mission upIf you could send me a few hun-dred blanks forms ^for^ Statistical ^reports^ they would be muchappreciated.I believe all the Elders in the missionhave good health, at least so far as I know, andthose on this Island left our conference in goodSpirits. I now have a very fair personal knowledgeof the condition of the Mission, having visited most of thebranches to do which have traveled about 3000 miles by on horseback and several hundred by Steamer and rail. Andwhile some of the districts are in a bad condition, uponthe whole we have much to Encourage us.Ever desiring the welfare of Zion andthe triumph of truth, I am, as I ever hope to be,obediently yours.W.

 Te Hauke,New Zealand, April 12th 1893.Prest W. Woodruff, Box. B. Salt Lake City.Dear Brother,Your favor of Feb. 27th came duly to hand. The Elders referred to therein arrived safely, and were present at our Conference, just closed.The two drafts, for £91.12.8, and £10.1.3, came to hand, and were duly forwarded to the Bank.The notice of reduction probably is too late to apply to Elder H. B. Dalling, in Australia, as I had previously sent unto him his fare from the amount on deposit. In relation to the reduction I beg to submit that the amount ^named^ would be sufficient if parties ^were^ sailing from Auckland or Sydney for SaltLake, but releases most frequently find Elders in their fields of labor, far removed from either of these ports, requiring from £1 to £4 to reach either of them, so that the former allowance left a margin ranging from $£25 to Nil, after necessary hotel expenses, in Auckland & San Francisco, were paid, but, in cases where the returning Elders resided far from Salt Lake and releases found found them at the farthest points from sailing port, even the former allowance was 
 inadequate. In cases where there has been a margin of any considerable amount it has been found almost indispensible, to enable the Elders to make themselves presentable for travelling, for which reason I have not felt justified in recommending a reduction of the fares.I hope to make arrangements with one of the Saints, who is going to Zion this month, for an exchange of money, whereby I will obtain sufficient funds, at your last mentioned rates, for the return fares of Elders J. M. Hendry, J. M. Hixson, J. G. Kelson and E. Atkin, (respecting which I wrote you Feb. 13th) drawing an order on you for the amount, viz: $500.Should I succeed, the order will be presented to you before May 17th. In case that it is not presented at that date, you will please forward the return fares for above-named Elders, but If, upon consideration of the foregoing, you should deem it proper to remit a larger sum, the balance may be forwarded, if the above-mentioned order is presented.I shall require four Elders to leave SanFrancisco, Aug 18th, amongst which, if possible, I would like another of our old Maori missionaries, who learned the language. 
 President Paxman will be able to advise you respecting those who labored under his direction.Elders Madsen, ^Dalling^ Hales, and Andrus will return to Zion this month, accompanied by three families of Europeans Saints, numbering about 17 souls.A native brother and his wife have importuned me very earnestly to permit them to accompany me home, with a view of permanently locating there.The husband speaks enough English for all practicable purposes, and is very industrious and economical. They have been very exemplary members since their baptism in 1884.I feel that they would be contented and prosperous in Zion, but do not wish to encourage them without your permission, and I mention it now, that, in case you sanction their gathering, they can make preparations after your advice reaches me.Our Annual Conference has just closed and all the Elders present feel that the Mission is in a prosperous condition. 
 We had a large gathering and a good spirit prevailed.Enclosed please find our Semi AnnualStatistical Report.The health of the Elders is very good, and all join in kind regards,Your Brother in the Gospel,W T StewartPresident of the Australasian Mission.P.

 Auckland New ZealandAugust 12, 1893President W. Woodruff and CounselorsSalt Lake City Utah, U.S.A.Dear Brothren;In april last I wrote you enquiringly about a native who had impor-tuned me to allow him and his wife to accom-pany me to my home.  There was also another native with wife & one child who had then decided and is now fully decidedtermined to go to Zion as soon as he can finish selling his lands and settling his business. the latter one has already sent £200.0.0to Utah investing in sheep, and sa short time ago informed me that he had £300.0.0 more he would like to send to put in sheep which business he would like to follow. both of these speak English good enough for all practicalble purposes.There were two others a President of a branch and his wife with two children came nearly going by last mail Boat.  a failure to dispose of lands alone prevented.  Now comes a letter to hand from an invilid chief (Henry Potae) who has long desired to go, and I believe has obtained permission, that not only himself and family, but a number of 
 Gisborne, New Zealand Feby 14th 1893.President Wilford Woodruffand Counselors.Salt Lake CityDear Brethren;The two letters from Brother Reynolds containing £15.0.0 for a brother Fryer, and $2500 in green backs for Elder Nebeker came safely to hand.We will require four Elders to take the places of Elders that will be released to return home about July 15ththey should come by the Steamer which is booked to leave San fFrancisco May 26th.If a good supply of Morgans Nos 1 and 2 and Richs "True vs false Religion" ^Tracts^ could be sent out by these brethren they would be very much appreciated by the Elders laboring among the EuropeansAnd by the same mail will need return fares for Elders J. M. Hendry, Jno G. Kelson J. M.

 of others residing near him 2181 souls altogether are making preperations and expect to leave for Zion just after the April Conference, asking me at the same time writes me for advice,and notwithstanding there has been a generaldiscouragement to gathering throughout out the mission. Yet a few of the saints in different parts seem very anxious to go, and the Spirit of gathering resting upon them seems irrepressable,  another case I failed to mention is the mother of the the maori boy who went home with my nephew J C Stewart in 1886.  and is now a young man living at Kanab, and quite able to look after his mother and two younger brothersShe has been deserted by her husband, and suffers very much from asthma, but is one of the most faithful of saints.  beleiieveing that our dry mountain air would give her a new lease of life and that naught but good can possibly result from her goining I have so advised,but in her case only.  However I feel strongly impressed that it will be greatly to the advantage of this mission If a few here and there of the most faithful and those best calculated to look out for themselves were to gather out, that they may go there and becomeaccustomed to the new conditions, thereby being a great aid to those who should follow them yet a believe 
 Our native mission here is coming on, as well I think, as we can reasonably expect. Inour efforts to put down betting in all its various forms your direct and pointed counsel has been of great benefit carrying weight and influence with the natives, and all ^thus far^ with with only one or two exceptions have agreed to cease this vice which have been depriving those engaging therein of a free flow of the Holy Spirit. There is a marked improvement going on with those who are faithfulin this land.Preparations are now being made for our April Conference to be held at Te Haukeand the Saints and Elders are looking forward to that event with much pleasure. 1893 has thus far distinguished itself, ^on th[e]se islands^ in the peculiararity of its weather and the number of itsearthquakes it has thus far produced. New Zeal-and has had a couple of miniture cyclones, whilst in Australia unprecedented floods in some sections and drougth in others have done ^an^ imme[n]se ammountof damage greatly increasing the suffering, desti-tution and misery which has prevailed there for two or three years and the end is probably not yetfor the inhabitants are reported as being in the main anv ungodly, immoral set, many of them keeping up no "form of Godliness" whilst the great majority of those who do are "lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God"  they seem to be  
 rappidly preparing themselves for the wrath and indignation of an offended God which will as surely be poured out upon the unrepentant and rebelleous inhabitants, ^of the earth^ as it has been foretold by the spirit of prophecy and the revelations of the Almighty.In the main the Elders seem to sense the responsibility the Lord has placed upon themin by calling them to preach repentance and warnmankind. And are endeavoring to perform this labor of love as the Spirit directs that their garments may be free from the blood of this generation.We feel that the Lord is still softening the hearts of the enemies of Zion as is manifested by Judge Zanes recent decision in the church suit, the granting of am^n^esty, dismissing of old cases against our brethren, and the general disposition of the pressand people to deal more freely with the saints.We have watched with no little interest the recentpolitical contest in our Territory and while we regret the spirit of strife and bitterness manifested by many of the saints when carried away with the excitment of debate wherein crimination and recrimination was indulged and offensive person-alities were substituted for argument, yetwe think experiences of this nature are necessary,sooner or a later, are necessary to qualify the saints to assume that high position among the 
 great care should be exercised in selecting those who are first advised to go, to avoid if posible murmuring and dissatisfaction on their part till they be come thouroughly established.  I am satifed that the nations of New Zealand, owing to the severer climate, poorer soil and meagre natural productions of the country they inhabit are naturally much better fitted for residence in the valleys of the Rockies than the inhabi-tants of other Islands of the pacific where dwell members people of this interesting race, whilst their extensive associantions, and business intercourse with Europeans for a generation will enable them to readily assimilate with our people at home.all of the young men ^are^ expected here to earn their own living even when the family's to which they belong are, by virtue of lands, rents, or stock posesses, comparatively independant.  The labor they usualy seek ^is that^ offering the greatest reward and requiring the most exertion. Such as Sheep shearing,  grass seed gathering and bushefalling.  in these lines their aptitude and phsiysical strength enables them to eaisly compete with the white man,  in fact none of them have ^any^ dificulty in finding work even where the raks of unemployed whites are gradually increasing.  The probably payout more for clothing and nearly as much for groceries as the average white labourer, except in those isolated 
 nations which they are destined to occupy and thesooner begins their political education the soonerwill they be prepared but howe much better ifthe saints could avoid such unwarranted extremes,however those who will are saints indeed willcome through all th[e]se experiences and acknowledgeGods hand therein and that his power andblessings are with his people and that thecourse of Zion is upward and onward desiring to labor to that end and to keep pace ^there^ with.I remain as everYours etcW.

The wall of prejudice & intolerence, which have so long stood between the servants of God and the hearts of the people, seem of late to be crumbling away.  The impartial accounts, published throughout this part of the world, of the Salt Lake Temple and its dedication have contributed no little to this end.I have recently learned that Elder Jas S. Abbott, of Annabella Sevier Co. Utah, who landed here in Oct 6th 1892.  And of whose coming I was duly notified, received his endowments in the Manti Temple, July 22nd of that year.  Afterwards or Aug 18thhe married a wife at Hinckley by Bp Pratt of that

I have felt to present this matter before you as we view it from this point of obvsersvastion, at the same time desire to be guided in this, as in all matters, by your inspired wisdom.Prisident Reynolds letter of July 18th notifying me of the intended departure of the next two companies of Elders for this field ^has been rec'd^ I see by the papers that a change of the time of departure of the steamers of this line from Frisco will occur in October next leaving there one week earlier than time table date.

He says that the President of the Temple, ^or whom he supposed, to be,^ advised this course after he (Abbott) had related to him all the particulars of the case.  He says also that "the Bishop of his ward and Henry Clark of Richfield were both cognizant of the circumstances."  I asked him if Bp Pratt knew he had his endowments when he married him he said "He could not say."  This matter being so very irregular I cannot think but what some blunder has been committed notwithstanding the representations of Bro Abbott.  I therefore feel ^constrained^ to report the matter to you and will anxiously await your action thereon, as I have advised that he do no ordinance work till the matter is cleared up, or an authoritative explanation is received.We have been having an usually wet cold winter, rivers flooded, and bridle paths in many places well nigh impassable.  Notwithstanding which the health of the elders is remarkably good, and their influence is being felt for good especially among the remnants of Israel in this land.

Prejudice melts away much more readily at the approach of truth than formerly and, everything bids fair for a good seasons work.Notwithstanding your kind response when asked for tracts we have been much handicaped for the want of these convenient little messengers to introduce us to the people.  and have ordered several thousand from Liverpool.  but should you advise us to go a head with the purchase of a press, I think that in a short time this difficulty will be overcome.The health of the Elders continues good so far as I am at present advised.

 Auckland New ZealandNov. 5th 1892President Wilford Woodruff & CounsellorsSalt Lake City Utah U.S.A.Dear Brethren;By the outgoing mail boat"S S Monowai" four Elders will depart for home, allof which have fperformed good missions and have been hounourably released:  They are O. C. Dunford P P. Thomas, A. L. Young, and J. H. Thorpe.I believe I wrote in my last for return fares for Elders Bennion and Taylor if not please send by return mail.  Five ^six^ Elders willbe required by march and can return with the "Monowai"  ^on her next trip,^ if the present boats keep on the line in their present order.On my arrival here President Bingham told me that there was a balance yet due ^you^ on an ammount loaned this mission on publishing the Book of Mormon but I find no account of the same and would be obliged for a state-ment of the acc't.The Alameda is now over due from 'Frisco but not in.but is probably signalled, but I must close or will be to late.As everYours etcW.

 uUpon my first meeting ^with the natives^ it wasvery dificult for me to speak intheir language; Puite and Spanishwords constantly intruded uponthe limited vocabulary of maoriI had vividly retained, but itwas of short duration. The constructionof the language has become quiteclear and words are coming tome every day so that I can geton full as well now as any ofthe Elders left in the mission withwhom I am acquainted. Manyof the Elders who come here neverlearn the language good andsome of them scarcely at allas a rule those who are fluentspeakers in English succeed well in the Maori. If they could beselected for this mission withregard to their natural abillity to acquire a new language no

 Kirikiri Hauraki N. Z.October 5th 1893Prest Wilford Woodruff and CounselorsSalt Lake City. Utah. U. S. A.Dear Brethren,Elders Ridges, Young, andJohnson arrived safely by the last Frisco Steamer. ElderRidges being appointed to the Australian district continuedhis voyage by the same boat, after a five hours rest in Auckland.We will require ^by return and mail,^ £60.0.0 as return fares of Elders R. G. Miekle and D. B. Stewart whom we expect to release to go home by the next departure of the "Monowai," which will be Decr 28th."The Ready References" have been prepared for publication and placed in the hands of the printer, the first bound coppies of which we may expect by the last of Decr. Money has already been collected for the printing and by the time the first lot is bound we will probably have enough in hand to meet our obligations therefor. After the sale of the first thousand ^coppies,^ it will be on a safe business footing.We have agitated, to some extent, the purchasing of a small printing press, for the purpose of issuing a paper in the maori language, and, the printing of what tracts we may need in the mission. The idea meets with univer- 
 doubt much better results wouldattend their labors in this land;The health of the Eldershere I believe is good withoutan exception. We are all much grattified to learn that PrestSmith is once more permitted tomingle with the body of the church,and to minister the words of lifeand salvation to the SaintsEver pray-ing the welfare of the Saints, andthe blessings and the blessings of ourGod upon those whom he haschosen to guide and direct, I amas I ever hope to be your fellowlaborerW.

 sal favor among the natives and Elders. I think the Saints here would subscribe quite liberally of their means towards this end, both, for its establishment and maintenance, however, we do not feel like moving out in this direction without your advice, the more so as none of us have had experience in this line of business. Should you feel to en-courage the undertaking, providing it can be made self supporting, any advice as to kind, size, and probable cost of press, will be greatly appreciated. Upon the receipt of your reply to this, if favorable, the mission will be im-mediately canvassed and if the results warrant will proceed at once to make arrangements etc., in which case we would want a practical printer sent out, the younger the better, so he could acquire the language, thereby, greatly increasing his useful-ness.The measles have swept over this country, and, though, usually very fatal with natives, who are ignorant of its nature and proper treatment, the mortality has been very light indeed, as compared to its former visits to these Islands.The general health now, of both Elders and Saints is good so far as I am advised.The "female franchise" and "local option" has made the present session of N. Z. Parliament very lively and caused a quite a ripple on the political sea of the colony and I might say of Australasia. The success of the former measure is now in accomplished fact, and may be regarded as a very radical departure for a British Colony. Of course, it had bitter opponents among the conservative class 
 Auckland New Zealand.October 8th 1892.Pres Wilford Woodruff and Counselors.Salt Lake City. Utah. U. S. A.Dear Brethren:I have pleasure in ac-knowledging your favor of Sept 12th. The Six Elderstherein named had a very pleasant and speedyvoyage arriving here in good health on the 6th.I anticipate releasing Elders MiltonBennion and C. W. Taylor on Decr 25th to returnto Zion and therefore will need £60.0.0 for theirreturn fares, by return mail. The £180.0.0 mentionedin your last came Safely to hand.We will needfive ormore Elders by April and will probably bebest to have them come on the "S S Monowai" whichis expected to leave Sanfrancisco March 3rd 1893.The latest accounts from the most ofthe district are quite encouraging and we regardthe future prospects ^as being^ good.Ever praying the blessingsof God upon Zion and her inhabitants.I am as ever hope to be.Your BrotherW.

 only passing the upper House by a majority of 2. Thelocal option Bill will succeed, but no doubt, but in such aform that but little good can expected from it.Although this is a new country, "Strikes," "labour troubles"and "unemployed" are not strangers here. Money has exercised afar greater influence here in the settlement of this country, than,what we have known, especially, in the western part of America.Land monopoly, or the mopoly of the natural facilities,make it an easy matter for Capital to dictate its ownterms, which means the enslavement of the masses. What acontrast between this and the ^Spirit,^ method, and ultimate resultscharacterizing the settlement of the Saints in the once forbiding,but now, beatutiful and happy vales of Zion.These is a strong feeling growing here in favor of thesingle tax system, so ably advocated by Henry Georgeof America and looking to the naturalization of the land.The Gov't here are proceeding somewhat along those lines bya system of a grauated land tax. The law being adjusted so thatthe larger the holdings the greater their proportionate amount of tax.Of course wise legislation may, to some extent, modifyexisting evils, but, only modify, for their final abolition,we must look to something that will tear from the heartof man the incubus of selfishness an[d] hate; immerse intin a solution that will dissolve its calloused surface which hasbeen formed by ages of accumulated wrongs and oppressions;then, implant within it a love that is as broad ashumanity, and as induring as eternity; inspire it with aknowledge of man's brotherhood and God's fatherhood,
