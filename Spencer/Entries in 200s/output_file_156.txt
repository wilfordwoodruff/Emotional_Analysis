 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP.O. Box B.Salt Lake City, Utah. Dec. 12, 1894.  189Elder B. Cluff Jr.,B. Y. Academy, Provo.Dear Brother:Your favor of Dec. 5th has been received. We regret thatany circumstances have arisen to cause you to so write. We believe weappreciate the good that the B. Y. Academy is doing, and would not donor say anything, nor have others do or say anything, that would lessenits influence for good among the youth of Israel. We are, however, ledto think that possibly you received an exaggerated account of what Bro.Grant said at the Y.M.M.I.A. Conference, as we understand you were not present, and had to depend on what others, who were, possibly, undulyexcited, told you. Bro. Joseph F. Smith was present, and did not recog-nize in the remarks made those difficulties that present themselves toyour mind and those of your associate teachers, and he thought that when,later in the day, Bro. Grant made an explanation, if not an apology, thathe covered the objectionable features of his earlier remarks. We believethat you will act wisely in letting the matter drop, as we do not thinkthe incident was of sufficient importance for you to entertain theindignant feelings that your letter suggests.With kindest regards,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffJos. F. Smith

 An account of the mission to the Cherokee, Creek and Choctam Indians in the years 1855 to 1860.At the April Conference held in G.S.L. Cityin the year 1855, Elders Henry W. Miller,Robert C. Petty, Wash ton N. Cook, Wm. Richeyand John A. Richards were appointeda mission to the Indians west of Missouriand Arkansas States. They left Salt Lakevalley in May 1855 and reached Mormongrove in June; after reaching Kaw riverthe President, Bro. Miller appointed BrosCook and Richards to labor among the DelawareIndians, the remainder of the brethren wentto the Cherokee Nation, where they reached inthe fore-part of July. They stopped amonga small number of brethren on Spavenaw river in the Cherokee N., who had come fromTexas, but meeting some of  J. J. Strong'sdisciples in the Cherokee Nation, they concludedthat matters were rather wrong in Salt Lakeand located in the C. [] Some of those beth-ren had been with Lyman Wight and becoming 
 dissatisfied with his course, had left him. Bro. Millerwith his associates soon convinced those brethrenconcerning the leadership of the Church andthe majority of them numbering betw. 40 and 50emigrated to the valley in 1856. In 1858 and 1859 the remaining few of the Lyman Wight followerslocated at the same place; among the number arethe Colonel's first wife, who had of late receiveda letter from Sidney Rigdon, in which he denouncesthe authorities of the Church in the valley and prophesies evil concerning this people. ElderHenry Eyring has preached in 1859 to those people, they however uphold their own views and likelywill until the Lord chooses to interfere in their be-half.Bros Cook and Richards who had been un-successful among the Delaware joined theirbrethren in the Cherokee Nation in the forepartof fall 1855 and commenced their labors inthe Cherokee nation. Mormonism being quitea new thing in that country the people cameby great numbers ^to hear^ and as a general thinga good many believed and a few werebaptized. Prest Orson Spencer and Elder JamesMc Gaw came from St Louis to counsell with the brethren concerning the work in that country 
 and had an interview with the chief of the CherokeesJohn Ross, who granted them the privilege to preach. Prest Miller deemed it wisdom to callon the St Louis church for some Elders to assistamong the Cherokees and other nations if required. Subsequently upon the return of Prest Spencer ata Conference, held in St Louis Octob 6 1855 EldersJames Case, Wm Bricker, Geo Higginson Wm O.Flavell and Henry Eyring were sent to assistthe Elder on the Ch. Mission. They arrived all but Wm O. Flavell who concluded to return toKeokuk after going with the rest as far asSpringfield Mo on the 10th Novemb 1855 at thesettlement on Spavinaw, Ch. N. At a meetingheld in the same place Pres Case, Richards, Brickerand Eyring were appointed to labor among the Creek, and Bros Cook and Higginson among theChoctaw Indians. Bro Miller and Richeyto remain in the Cherokee Nation principally. Bro R C Petty was in very poor health andfinally died Feb 1st 1856. Bros Richards and Bricker andon their wayto the Creek Nation stopped at the house of Some Cherokees (Wm Burgess and family)Mrs Mary Burgess an old lady was at the point of death and was given up by the doctor 
 4and her children to die. The brethren administ-ered to her and the Lord raised her up and she and most of her family subsequent-ly were baptized. December 31st 1855 BrosCase and Eyring arrived in the Creek Nationand commenced to lay the foundation for the workin that country. Bro Case and Richards went to see the chief of the Creeks, Gen [] Rollie McIntoshwho thought that there were already preachers enoughin the country and there was no need of any more.He however did not forbid us to preach. Thewinter in the forepart of 1856 was very severe andthe Elders on that mission being obliged to laborfor their board, suffered to a good extent.At the opening of spring they receieved their labors and were syccessful in baptizing some. Bro Eyring baptized an Indian Town chief, who through his influence inclineda number to be baptized The same springBro Case organizied a branch called PrincesCreek branch Creek N.; at present they are not fully organized in that locality; the firstPrest resigned, the 2nd died and the thirdapostatised and the fourth resigned; they nowhave a teacher and meet ocasionally for worship. In April 56 Bro Eyring having received an invitation, made a trip into the Cherokee Nation and baptized 6 in the course ofthe summer and ordained one Elder, one of those bapitzed was aged 145, helived 2 years after his baptism anddied in the faith. Several were also added 
 by the other Elders and a branch organized onPriors Creek Cher. N. in the summer of 1856. Thoseconnected with that branch have removed toanother locailty and the branch was dissolved. Sickness now made considerable []upon the Elders, they were all take with the []and fever and at a Conference held on PriorsCreek Octob 6th 1856 there was not one of themin the enjoyment of health. Bro Miller beingreleased, appointed Bro Cook Prest of the missionand released Bro Case who was then quite low. Bro Bricker had previously recievedleave to visit his wife in St Loudis and had leftbefore Conference, but never returned andsince has denied the faith. Pres Miller and Case left in November 1856 and returned to thevalley in 1857. - Bros Cook and Higginsonreturned in Oct 56 from the Cherokee nation, without being able to baptize any. ThatNation has since been left without Elderswith the exception of 2 trips which BroEyring made there in the summer of 1859without having any success apparently. In October 1856 an order was issued by theChief of the Cherokees for all Mormon 
 Elders to leave the nation forthwith. Thus all united to labor among the Creeks with theexception of Bro Richey who remained amongthe Cherokees unmolested by avoiding public speaking. Bro Richey has been a faithful ministerto the Cherokees and although unsuccessfulin baptizing any, he has borne a faithful testimonyand considering his age and bodily infirmitieshe certainly has done more than many woulddo under the same circumstances. Having also beenrestricted in the Creek Nation but little wasdone for the remainder of the year 1856 by theElders. April 6th 1837 a conference was heldin the Creek Nation Bro Cook presiding; ElderP.P. Pratt present; we had a time of rejoicingand Bro Pratt experienced himself satisfied with the labors of the Elders. Bro Higginsonhaving been requested by Bro Pratt before hisdeath to see his family in the valley, left inthe summer of 57. The same summer an order was issued by the Creek council for all Mormon Elders to leave the Nation. Bros Cook and Richards left for the Cherokee Nation where they recommenced their laborswithout being disturbed. Bro Eyring waspermitted to stay in the ^the^ Creek Nation on the 
 condition that he be employed to work for a native. The general excitement against the church in 1857 made it impossible to domuch good and but little was effected everafterwards. Pres Cook who won the love andrespect of saint and sinner, after a short but severe illness died September 24th 1858 of quick consumption. At a conference heldin the Cherokee Nation Bro Henry Eyring wasnorminated and sustained as Bro Cook's successor. A general work of reformation was then commenced,and the saints required to be rebaptizedIn the year 1859 Prest Eyring travelled in the Cherokee Creek and Choface nations, and added a numberto the church and organized one branch(Lehi branch in Cher. N) and one (Nephi branch) inthe Creek Nation. The former branch was dis-organized, the Prest and teacher emigrating to the valley. There is one Elder in that locality who has change of the few remaining saints there. The branch in the Creek nation is still organized, the Prest having charge ofall the saints in the Creek Nation. The number of saints in the Cherokee andCreek nations was Octob 6 1859 43 in the former 
 and 48 in the latter nation but out of that number but very few are alive in the cause, the majorityare careless and indifferent. The prospect to do further good at present being quite slimElders Wm Richey and Henry Eyring leftMay 23rd 1860 for the valley and reachedSalt Lake City Aug. 29th. Bro Richardsstill remains on his own accord in the Cherokee Nation, not situated however to do much good.In taking retroactive view over the laborsof the Elders among those Indians for 5years, it is quite evident that the resultof those toils, privations and hardshipsand the sickness of all and the deathof 2 Elders connected with it, is but verysmall apparently. But it is to be hopedthat in after years spontaneous fruits may spring up frrom the exortions of theservants of God among the seed of Jacob.-The Cherokees are to a great extent mixedwith the Gentiles and to some degree with the negroes. A majority of themspeak the english language and arein their manners, customs, habits and traditions similar to if not equal unto the whites. Quite a number have goodbrick and frame houses and have 
 good farms well stocked with negroes, cattle horses and hogs etc. They are as a people hospitable to strangers they will feed and lodge an Elder, but they don't realize that he has to have clothing towear and that they out to contributeto that portion of his wants; The Elderstherefore were oblihed to labor with theirhands from time to time to obtain thosenecessaries. They are politically organized similar to the whites, having a 1th and 2nd chief upper and lowerhouse of represaentatives, judges, courts and plenty of lawyers, which by thebye is no essential benefit to anycountry . Wickedness is on the in-crease among them; murders are com-mitted almost every week. Muchexcitement also prevails on a/c of the slavery question.Their country is excellent for farming, timber as grass are abundant. The full blooded Cherokees are generally indolent and farm on a very smallscale, many however raise cotton 
 and sheep and spin, dye and weave theirown clothing. They have some steam andwater power mills in operation. -The Creeks are less united with the Gentiles but more with the negroes than the Cherokees. They are as respects good houses, farmsand general improvements behind theCherokees, murder is but seldom committed(although on the increase) and generally speaking the Creeks are more peaceable, but lessenterprizing than the Cherokees. Their politicalorganization is similar to that of the Cherokeesbut remains a good deal of yet of old customsand traditions. Some have extensive herdsof cattle numbering a thousand head and upwards, also ponies by large quantities.Sectarianism has been disseminatedamong both nations to a great extentand although much has been saidagainst the Elders by them yet they haveused no violence to them all most understanding some having made threats to that effect.The Cherokees at present number about16000 the Creeks near about the same. 
 Much might be added to this account but I hardly deem it wisdom to be too lengthly, hoping that what I have written may be accepted.I subscribe myself with high esteemyour Bro in the gospelHenry EyringTo Elder Wilford WoodruffHistorian's Office
