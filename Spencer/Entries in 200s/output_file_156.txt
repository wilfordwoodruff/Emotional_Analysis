 through. No one seems to have a cent of money, and the y storees are crowding every one who owe them a dollar: I suppose these are the conidtions of the people all over the nation, but we havn't been quite asleep.  We have selected two young men and they were in Provo at the coommencement of this term. Fransis Sprowul, from  Washington and son of the Bishop and grandson of our old brother Sprowul the singer, and George Miles of St George, A smart  bright young man, half brother to the celebrated bro. Miles. also a university student. 
 We have in our city Mrs Mary Lund Judd, second wife of Bishop Thomas Judd, who took five weeks term in August. Being quite freehanded and an experienced hand we thought her quite suitable, providing you would call her, without going again to Provo. This would give  this Stake three, which would be quite a quorm to start with Brother Sprowuls boy made arrange- ments to pay his board in produce from Dixie. This made us late in sending you the names, but we wished to have every certain. The Residency is agreeable in  this matter. I remain your Bro.  Supt. St. Geo. Stake. R. Morris 
 OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  P.O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah. Dec. 12, 1894.  189  Elder B. Cluff Jr., B. Y. Academy, Provo.  Dear Brother:  Your favor of Dec. 5th has been received. We regret that any circumstances have arisen to cause you to so write. We believe we appreciate the good that the B. Y. Academy is doing, and would not do nor say anything, nor have others do or say anything, that would lessen its influence for good among the youth of Israel. We are, however, led to think that possibly you received an exaggerated account of what Bro. Grant said at the Y.M.M.I.A. Conference, as we understand you were  not present, and had to depend on what others, who were, possibly, unduly excited, told you. Bro. Joseph F. Smith was present, and did not recog- nize in the remarks made those difficulties that present themselves to your mind and those of your associate teachers, and he thought that when, later in the day, Bro. Grant made an explanation, if not an apology, that he covered the objectionable features of his earlier remarks. We believe that you will act wisely in letting the matter drop, as we do not think the incident was of sufficient importance for you to entertain the indignant feelings that your letter suggests.  With kindest regards, Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Jos. F. Smith

 An account of the mission to the Cherokee,  Creek and Choctam Indians in the  years 1855 to 1860.  At the April Conference held in G.S.L. City in the year 1855, Elders Henry W. Miller, Robert C. Petty, Wash ton N. Cook, Wm. Richey and John A. Richards were appointed a mission to the Indians west of Missouri and Arkansas States. They left Salt Lake valley in May 1855 and reached Mormon grove in June; after reaching Kaw river the President, Bro. Miller appointed Bros Cook and Richards to labor among the Delaware Indians, the remainder of the brethren went to the Cherokee Nation, where they reached in the fore-part of July. They stopped among a small number of brethren on Spavenaw  river in the Cherokee N., who had come from Texas, but meeting some of  J. J. Strong's disciples in the Cherokee Nation, they concluded that matters were rather wrong in Salt Lake and located in the C. [] Some of those beth- ren had been with Lyman Wight and becoming 
 dissatisfied with his course, had left him. Bro. Miller with his associates soon convinced those brethren concerning the leadership of the Church and the majority of them numbering betw. 40 and 50 emigrated to the valley in 1856. In 1858 and  1859 the remaining few of the Lyman Wight followers located at the same place; among the number are the Colonel's first wife, who had of late received a letter from Sidney Rigdon, in which he denounces the authorities of the Church in the valley and  prophesies evil concerning this people. Elder Henry Eyring has preached in 1859 to those people,  they however uphold their own views and likely will until the Lord chooses to interfere in their be- half.  Bros Cook and Richards who had been un- successful among the Delaware joined their brethren in the Cherokee Nation in the forepart of fall 1855 and commenced their labors in the Cherokee nation. Mormonism being quite a new thing in that country the people came by great numbers ^to hear^ and as a general thing a good many believed and a few were baptized. Prest Orson Spencer and Elder James Mc Gaw came from St Louis to counsell with  the brethren concerning the work in that country 
 and had an interview with the chief of the Cherokees John Ross, who granted them the privilege to  preach. Prest Miller deemed it wisdom to call on the St Louis church for some Elders to assist among the Cherokees and other nations if required.  Subsequently upon the return of Prest Spencer at a Conference, held in St Louis Octob 6 1855 Elders James Case, Wm Bricker, Geo Higginson Wm O. Flavell and Henry Eyring were sent to assist the Elder on the Ch. Mission. They arrived all  but Wm O. Flavell who concluded to return to Keokuk after going with the rest as far as Springfield Mo on the 10th Novemb 1855 at the settlement on Spavinaw, Ch. N. At a meeting held in the same place Pres Case, Richards, Bricker and Eyring were appointed to labor among the  Creek, and Bros Cook and Higginson among the Choctaw Indians. Bro Miller and Richey to remain in the Cherokee Nation principally.  Bro R C Petty was in very poor health and finally died Feb 1st 1856.  Bros Richards and Bricker andon their way to the Creek Nation stopped at the house of  Some Cherokees (Wm Burgess and family) Mrs Mary Burgess an old lady was at the  point of death and was given up by the doctor 
 4 and her children to die. The brethren administ- ered to her and the Lord raised her up  and she and most of her family subsequent- ly were baptized. December 31st 1855 Bros Case and Eyring arrived in the Creek Nationand  commenced to lay the foundation for the work in that country. Bro Case and Richards went  to see the chief of the Creeks, Gen [] Rollie McIntosh who thought that there were already preachers enough in the country and there was no need of any more. He however did not forbid us to preach. The winter in the forepart of 1856 was very severe and the Elders on that mission being obliged to labor for their board, suffered to a good extent. At the opening of spring they receieved their  labors and were syccessful in baptizing  some. Bro Eyring baptized an Indian  Town chief, who through his influence inclined a number to be baptized The same spring Bro Case organizied a branch called Princes Creek branch Creek N.; at present they are  not fully organized in that locality; the first Prest resigned, the 2nd died and the third apostatised and the fourth resigned; they now have a teacher and meet ocasionally for  worship. In April 56 Bro Eyring having received  an invitation, made a trip into the Cherokee  Nation and baptized 6 in the course of the summer and ordained one Elder, one  of those bapitzed was aged 145, he lived 2 years after his baptism and died in the faith. Several were also added 
 by the other Elders and a branch organized on Priors Creek Cher. N. in the summer of 1856. Those connected with that branch have removed to another locailty and the branch was dissolved.  Sickness now made considerable [] upon the Elders, they were all take with the [] and fever and at a Conference held on Priors Creek Octob 6th 1856 there was not one of them in the enjoyment of health. Bro Miller being released, appointed Bro Cook Prest of the mission and released Bro Case who was then quite  low. Bro Bricker had previously recieved leave to visit his wife in St Loudis and had left before Conference, but never returned and since has denied the faith. Pres Miller and  Case left in November 1856 and returned to the valley in 1857. - Bros Cook and Higginson returned in Oct 56 from the Cherokee nation,  without being able to baptize any. That Nation has since been left without Elders with the exception of 2 trips which Bro Eyring made there in the summer of 1859 without having any success apparently.  In October 1856 an order was issued by the Chief of the Cherokees for all Mormon  
 Elders to leave the nation forthwith. Thus all  united to labor among the Creeks with the exception of Bro Richey who remained among the Cherokees unmolested by avoiding public  speaking. Bro Richey has been a faithful minister to the Cherokees and although unsuccessful in baptizing any, he has borne a faithful testimony and considering his age and bodily infirmities he certainly has done more than many would do under the same circumstances. Having also been restricted in the Creek Nation but little was done for the remainder of the year 1856 by the Elders. April 6th 1837 a conference was held in the Creek Nation Bro Cook presiding; Elder P.P. Pratt present; we had a time of rejoicing and Bro Pratt experienced himself satisfied  with the labors of the Elders. Bro Higginson having been requested by Bro Pratt before his death to see his family in the valley, left in the summer of 57. The same summer an  order was issued by the Creek council  for all Mormon Elders to leave the Nation.  Bros Cook and Richards left for the Cherokee  Nation where they recommenced their labors without being disturbed. Bro Eyring was permitted to stay in the ^the^ Creek Nation on the 
 condition that he be employed to work for  a native. The general excitement against the church in 1857 made it impossible to do much good and but little was effected ever afterwards. Pres Cook who won the love and respect of saint and sinner, after a short but  severe illness died September 24th 1858 of  quick consumption. At a conference held in the Cherokee Nation Bro Henry Eyring was norminated and sustained as Bro Cook's successor.  A general work of reformation was then commenced, and the saints required to be rebaptized In the year 1859 Prest Eyring travelled in the Cherokee  Creek and Choface nations, and added a number to the church and organized one branch (Lehi branch in Cher. N) and one (Nephi branch) in the Creek Nation. The former branch was dis- organized, the Prest and teacher emigrating  to the valley. There is one Elder in that  locality who has change of the few remaining  saints there. The branch in the Creek nation  is still organized, the Prest having charge of all the saints in the Creek Nation.  The number of saints in the Cherokee and Creek nations was Octob 6 1859 43 in the former 
 and 48 in the latter nation but out of that number  but very few are alive in the cause, the majority are careless and indifferent. The prospect  to do further good at present being quite slim Elders Wm Richey and Henry Eyring left May 23rd 1860 for the valley and reached Salt Lake City Aug. 29th. Bro Richards still remains on his own accord in the Cherokee  Nation, not situated however to do much good.  In taking retroactive view over the labors of the Elders among those Indians for 5 years, it is quite evident that the result of those toils, privations and hardships and the sickness of all and the death of 2 Elders connected with it, is but very small apparently. But it is to be hoped that in after years spontaneous fruits  may spring up frrom the exortions of the servants of God among the seed of  Jacob.-  The Cherokees are to a great extent mixed with the Gentiles and to some degree  with the negroes. A majority of them speak the english language and are in their manners, customs, habits and  traditions similar to if not equal unto  the whites. Quite a number have good brick and frame houses and have 
 good farms well stocked with negroes,  cattle horses and hogs etc. They are as a  people hospitable to strangers they will  feed and lodge an Elder, but they don't  realize that he has to have clothing to wear and that they out to contribute to that portion of his wants; The Elders therefore were oblihed to labor with their hands from time to time to obtain those necessaries. They are politically organ ized similar to the whites, having a  1th and 2nd chief upper and lower house of represaentatives, judges, courts  and plenty of lawyers, which by the bye is no essential benefit to any country . Wickedness is on the in- crease among them; murders are com- mitted almost every week. Much excitement also prevails on a/c of the  slavery question.  Their country is excellent for farming,  timber as grass are abundant.  The full blooded Cherokees are generally  indolent and farm on a very small scale, many however raise cotton 
 and sheep and spin, dye and weave their own clothing. They have some steam and water power mills in operation. -  The Creeks are less united with the Gentiles  but more with the negroes than the Cherokees.  They are as respects good houses, farms and general improvements behind the Cherokees, murder is but seldom committed (although on the increase) and generally speaking  the Creeks are more peaceable, but less enterprizing than the Cherokees. Their political organization is similar to that of the Cherokees but remains a good deal of yet of old customs and traditions. Some have extensive herds of cattle numbering a thousand head  and upwards, also ponies by large quantities.  Sectarianism has been disseminated among both nations to a great extent and although much has been said against the Elders by them yet they have used no violence to them all most  understanding some having made threats  to that effect.  The Cherokees at present number about 16000 the Creeks near about the same. 
 Much might be added to this account  but I hardly deem it wisdom to be too  lengthly, hoping that what I have written  may be accepted.  I subscribe myself with high esteem your Bro in the gospel Henry Eyring  To Elder Wilford Woodruff Historian's Office
