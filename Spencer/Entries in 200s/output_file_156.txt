The following is a synopsis of his remarks   I can say to Brother Smoot and family that they have not a thousandth part the reason to regret or grieve in this bereave- ment that other parties have who have froward sons. I would rather follow all my children to the grave than to have them froward in their wasys and witnessing them turning from the   ENDENTRY June 22nd, 1863 paths which are right. When our children are called to go hence. When our children are taken from us who have not Jeperdized their chances of Salvation, we have reason to rejoice instead of mourning. young lad, he was a fine boy and as far as he had grown up he manifested the finest traits of character. he is now locked up whare he is safe and sure of salvation Is not this a comfort? It is to me. What would have been the lads future course? We do not know. I do not know what will be the future course of my children. Do you know? I have witnessed such scenes. Ownly once in my life has my head acked. This was when martered. in parting with Fathers Mothers, wives and children is no comparison to it. When I feel as though the top of my head was coming off then I think sumthing is the matter I felt this was for Many days I can call to mind, those who have Endured more than I in some things. Here sit b sits before me to day a good Father and mother who lost a son under more painful circumstances than this. He was murdered and his remains scattered over the plains. We have before us a beautiful boy cut down in the flower of youth yet we have No cause for morning, this I do know that when our youths have lived according to our council we have No cause to mourn. It is no trial of my faith to see my children laid in the grave But to see them Join with the wicked, forget their duty, and become froward this is a trial which in part I have Experienced all I ask is for grace to bear up under such trials that I may settle down in calm serenity and feel that the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away and blessed be the name of the Lord. I have heard that Brother  Smoot regretted that his son had not received his Endowment we are the ownly people that that can give our children their blessings. We can do it. Others cannot this should be a source of consolation to us. What is there for us to grieve about. Crying because God has taken our child to Heaven. Well we might cry if the devil had taken our child to Hell. If this family sit up and shout Hallalujah it will be more pleasing to the Lord than to sit up to cry   ENDENTRY June 22, 1863 Death is in the Land and we may Expect it I have freequently said when I die give me a decent burial that is all I ask. The grave has seemed to me the sweetest place I ever looked into in my life Brother Smoot is perhaps a better man than most of us. his trials remind him that he is still in a land of sorrow and trouble. If all who bear the name of saints get into the celestial world it will be because they purify themselves and are faithful and overcome and feel a little more the responsibility that belongs to the kingdom of God than many now do.
