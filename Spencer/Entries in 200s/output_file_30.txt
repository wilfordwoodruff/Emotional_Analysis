The interests of the Company are specially protectedby the German Imperial governement, through a residentdiplomatic agent at Constantinople, the amount of germancapital engaged in the undertaking being so enormous,and the enterprise itself, from an economic point of viewof such vast importance to Germany.

Dr. Siemens assured me that theturkish government and the Sultan personally are in favorof the development of that region and will do everything thatis necessary and within reason to foster it.In case you should take the remotest interest in thesuggestions made, and desire to be further informedI shall be pleased to communicate with the proper authoritieson the other side.

 ARTICLES OF FAITH,Of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.1. We Believe in God, the Eternal Father, andin His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.3. We believe that through the attonement ofChr[i]st, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to thelaws and ordinances of the Gospel.4. We believe that these ordinances are: First,Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance;third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins;fourth, Laying on of hands for the Gift of the HolyGhost.5. We believe that a man must be called of God,by "prophecy, and by the laying on of hands," bythose who are in authority, to preach the Gospel andadminister in the ordinances thereof.6. We believe in the same organization that ex-isted in the primitive church, viz: Apostles, prophets,pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy,revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues,etc.8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God,as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe theBook of Mormon to be the word of God.9. We believe all that God has revealed, allthat he does now reveal, and we believe that He willyet reveal many great and important things pertainingto the Kingdom of God.10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israeland in the restoration of the Ten Tribes. That Zionwill be built upon this contenent. That Christ willreign personally upon the earth, and that the earthwill be renewed and receive its paradisic glory.11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Al-mighty God according to the dictates of our conscienceand allow all men the same privilege, let them wor-ship how, where and what they may.12. We believe in being subject to kings, presi-dents, rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring andsustaining the law.13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, be-nevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to ALL MEN:indeed we may say that we follow the admonition ofPaul. "We believe all things, we hope all things,"we have endured many things, and hope to be able toendure all things. If there is anything virtuous,lovely or of good report or praisworthy, we seek afterthese things.â€”JOSEPH SMITH.

 I do not complain for I have not felt to regret sincecoming here that He served His own purpose in-stead of mine.My sentence will expire May 24, after which Iexpect to pay the other 200 dollars to the churchmaking in all 600 dollars without mention-ing interest on the 400 already paid.My fine and cost amount to 470 dollars. Ihave no way of paying this unless I borrow themoney; neither can I escape being held for it;and the point I presented to Apostle Lyman is:would there be any thing wrong in the churchpaying this 470 dollars fine, for the 600 I pay toit 400 dollars of which it already has?There is a possibility of my getting out without pay-ing fine and costs, of this I shall know morewhen Delegate Caine returns, and this point Bro.Lyman will explain when he meets you. ShouldI be so fortunate I ask nothing, expect nothing,neither would I accept anything, as it wasgiven freely and willingly. I shall write to ourtithing clerk for my yearly payments commenc-ing with the year 85, as proof of my assertion.Respectfully your Bro,Elijah A. BoxOver

Stillhe feels willing to go and risk holding hisland until his return, which I thinkwould be allright as the settlers in thelittle town where he lives are all goodpeople and I do not think would take anyadvantage of the circumstances.Will you kindly advise Bro.
