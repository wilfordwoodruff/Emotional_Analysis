For  this reason we would be very sorry to have  him leave us, and we therefore respectfully  ask you to allow him to remain with us  for another year as he is willing to do so  in case you see fit to grant him this  privilege. At the end of that time he will  be better prepared financially, to accomplish  a successful mission, and then we will  have no objection to his going. We have  labored under many disadvantages in getting teachers suitable for our school, but since Bro.
