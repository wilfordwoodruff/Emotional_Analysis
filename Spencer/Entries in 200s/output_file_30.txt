The project is to construct a system of railways, the main  line of which will traverse Asia Minor in a South-Easterly  course, connecting Constantinople with the Persian Gulf  The enterprise has been capitalized and construction of  the line has been under way since some time.

 of the company's charter and privilege is the Ottoman govern-  ment. The interests of the Company are specially protected  by the German Imperial governement, through a resident  diplomatic agent at Constantinople, the amount of german  capital engaged in the undertaking being so enormous,  and the enterprise itself, from an economic point of view  of such vast importance to Germany. The construction  of the line will develop the immense natural resources  of ancient Mesopotamia, the valleys of the Euphrates and  Tigris, and it is of the utmost importance to the enter-  prise that those regions should be settled by an intelligent  and enterprising class of people. One of the directors of the  company, who is also a director of the Deutsche Bank at  Berlin, and a valued friend of mine, has asked me the  question, whether I thought it advisable to invite  the attention of the authorities of your church to the grand  opportunity offered here for the formation of mass-settle-  ments, and requested me to write this confidential letter  to you.

 in the service of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. R. Comp.  whose Commissioner of Immigration I have been for  13 years, up to the summer of 1885. Dr. Siemens is  familiar with the great work done by the Mormon  people in Utah, and is of the opinion, that like results,  if not greater, could be accomplished in Asia Minor, under  a more tolerant and more sympathetic government.  The lands lying contiguous to the Anatolian Railway  are chiefly under personal control of the Sultan, and the  railway company would undertake to obtain grants from   him for settlements. Dr. Siemens assured me that the  turkish government and the Sultan personally are in favor  of the development of that region and will do everything that  is necessary and within reason to foster it.    In case you should take the remotest interest in the  suggestions made, and desire to be further informed  I shall be pleased to communicate with the proper authorities  on the other side.

 ARTICLES OF FAITH,  Of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    1. We Believe in God, the Eternal Father, and  in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.    2. We believe that men will be punished for   their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.    3. We believe that through the attonement of  Chr[i]st, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the  laws and ordinances of the Gospel.    4. We believe that these ordinances are: First,  Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance;  third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins;  fourth, Laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy  Ghost.    5. We believe that a man must be called of God,  by "prophecy, and by the laying on of hands," by  those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and  administer in the ordinances thereof.    6. We believe in the same organization that ex-  isted in the primitive church, viz: Apostles, prophets,  pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.    7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy,  revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues,  etc.    8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God,  as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the  Book of Mormon to be the word of God.    9. We believe all that God has revealed, all  that he does now reveal, and we believe that He will  yet reveal many great and important things pertaining  to the Kingdom of God.    10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel  and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes. That Zion  will be built upon this contenent. That Christ will  reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth  will be renewed and receive its paradisic glory.    11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Al-  mighty God according to the dictates of our conscience  and allow all men the same privilege, let them wor-  ship how, where and what they may.    12. We believe in being subject to kings, presi-  dents, rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and  sustaining the law.    13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, be-  nevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to ALL MEN:  indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of  Paul. "We believe all things, we hope all things,"  we have endured many things, and hope to be able to  endure all things. If there is anything virtuous,  lovely or of good report or praisworthy, we seek after  these things.—JOSEPH SMITH.

Woodruff,    Dear Bro,    In conversation with  Bro. Lyman, he advised me to write you in  regard to my affairs and of which I make the  following statement: When I was arrested in 1886  for cohabitation, being very much averse to the idea  of going to the Pen. I made a covenant with  the Lord that if He would so control matters as  to prevent my conviction, I would pay to the  church (over and above my regular tithes and  offerings) two hundred (200) Dollars a year for  three years. I kept my covenant during 1887  and 1888 paying the 200 dollars each year, nand  did not diminish from my tithes and donations  of previous years, although I was to considerable  trouble and a great deal of expense through this  persecution.    It is evident the Lord did not see fit to view  things in the light I hoped He would, of which

 I do not complain for I have not felt to regret since  coming here that He served His own purpose in-  stead of mine.    My sentence will expire May 24, after which I  expect to pay the other 200 dollars to the church  making in all 600 dollars without mention-  ing interest on the 400 already paid.    My fine and cost amount to 470 dollars. I  have no way of paying this unless I borrow the  money; neither can I escape being held for it;  and the point I presented to Apostle Lyman is:  would there be any thing wrong in the church  paying this 470 dollars fine, for the 600 I pay to  it 400 dollars of which it already has?    There is a possibility of my getting out without pay-  ing fine and costs, of this I shall know more  when Delegate Caine returns, and this point Bro.  Lyman will explain when he meets you. Should  I be so fortunate I ask nothing, expect nothing,  neither would I accept anything, as it was  given freely and willingly. I shall write to our  tithing clerk for my yearly payments commenc-  ing with the year 85, as proof of my assertion.    Respectfully your Bro,    Elijah A. Box    Over

It is at that time of the year, when it  would be almost impossible, "in this section  of the country," to get any person to take my  Ranch and save the crop already put  in. And futher I have been proving up  on my Land, and am in dept to some  extent. And I have also enterd into an  agreement with a Bro to look after his  place for the Summer. If these reasons are  sufficient for a postponment until Fall

 Franklin Idaho, 7/6/89    Prest. W. Woodruff    Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    The enclosed letter will explain  itself.  Bp. Jos E. Capell is a very good  man and well able to fill a good  mission, but since his name was  given to you to fill a mission, it appears  that the Fort Hall Indian Seservation  has been reduced, throwing open for  settlers, all that part known as Marsh  Valley, in which we have two wards  Bro Capell being the bishop of one of them  - Garden Creek - and to fill the  mission at present may deprive him of  the privilage of securing his home.  Still  he feels willing to go and risk holding his  land until his return, which I think  would be allright as the settlers in the  little town where he lives are all good  people and I do not think would take any  advantage of the circumstances.    Will you kindly advise Bro. Capell as  to your feelings in the matter Your Bro. Geo. C. Parkinson
