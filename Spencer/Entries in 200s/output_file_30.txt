For  this reason we would be very sorry to have  him leave us, and we therefore respectfully  ask you to allow him to remain with us  for another year as he is willing to do so  in case you see fit to grant him this  privilege. At the end of that time he will  be better prepared financially, to accomplish  a successful mission, and then we will  have no objection to his going. We have  labored under many disadvantages in getting teachers suitable for our school, but since Bro.

For  this reason we would be very sorry to have  him leave us, and we therefore respectfully  ask you to allow him to remain with us  for another year as he is willing to do so  in case you see fit to grant him this  privilege. At the end of that time he will  be better prepared financially, to accomplish  a successful mission, and then we will  have no objection to his going. We have  labored under many disadvantages in getting  teachers suitable for our school, but since Bro. Hanson has been here the children are learning  much better, the parents are taking increased interest and our school now has the name  of being the best in the County, and we hope with his aid to make it first class in every  respect during the coming season.

Believing that every young man who performs an honorable mission to the nations of the earth, will be greatly blest, I do not feel that it would be proper nor even desirable, through any refusal on my part to deny myself of any blessing that can thus be obtained.  Although I am pushed very closely financially, through the assistance of God, I hope to be able, to meet all require- ments.  I cheerfully accept the call, and my heart is filled with gratitude, that I am counted worthy to assist in preaching the Gospel, to the world.  Any information, relative to the time when I should be in Salt Lake City, and when I will be apt to find company, and what will be my needs will be very thankfully received.

Dear Brother:  Replying to your call of the 2nd inst, I would say that I am perfectly  willing to do my share to the best of my ability in helping to roll forward this great work, realizing as I do that it must of necessity be done.  Regarding my circumstances financially, would say that I am at present owing some money on my home but the rent of the place will more than pay the interest on that and I  therefor feel I can shape matters ^by knowing some more^ so as to be able to start at the time mentioned, though  being a member of the Tabernacle Choir it would help me a little if I could start with  them when they leave for Chicago.  I would here mention and ask your acquiescence in the taking of my wife and two children.  I shall have no way whatever of providing for them here, but, as my  wife's parents are in England and well able and willing to keep her and the children  I think it would be much better to take them over with me.  Her parents, though not in  the Church, have always received the travelling Elders with great kindness and we both feel that in all probability my wife could eventually lead them to see the light of the Gospel.  At all events she would be able to dispel some of the many calumnious tales which have been circulated by our enemies in that neighborhood since her departure  for Zion some years ago.  Not wishing to weary you with a long letter I would say in conclusion that her parents are now quite aged and would be overjoyed to have her and the children stay with them as long as they could.  Therefor, taking everything into consideration I think it would  be well for them to accompany me.
