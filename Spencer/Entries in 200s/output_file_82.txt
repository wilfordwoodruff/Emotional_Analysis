have that blessed opportunity.  Bro. I deem him a good man; a little impatient perhaps, sometimes, which we may, in charity, call firmness and zeal.  I gladly extend the hand of a brother to the elders especially to Bro. Metz and hope to see them all in the near future.  It will be a pleasure to release Bro. F. A. Brown to re- turn home and I believe Bro. Metz quite equal to the oc- casion.  Tho^se^ who study the Dutch language find it difficult to acquire and young men who are appointed to this mission accomplish but little in the field within two years.  I have written to Bro. Brown to give me his views respecting the prospects of the Holland mission, which report I write furni^s^h to you in due time.  Prests. Smith are perfectly familiar with the difficulties elders need in the Holland mission,  I am of the opinion that we need laborers there now, however I am willing to let the Lord dictate in this as in all other matters.  I will look anxiously for elders who are suitable to go to Turkey, but I can say to you now that, we need all the help we now have, and if you have in your mind good efficient men who are natural linguist, ENDENTRY I believe they ought to be called and sent to the Turkish mission  We have been discussing the propriety of putting our Milleniael star before the public as other papers are advertized. I can see no impropiity in doing it if we incur no additional expense.  Bro. Teasdale informs me that you appropriated a sum of money to assist in furnishing tracks to the elders; they are quite liberal with their own means in this good work.  You know our condition financially, that is, without your assistance track distributing ^by the elders^ will cease or be very much curtailed, and I am not clear but what the latter maybe the proper thing ^for^ theym to do:  Within the last month two of our brethern have been banished from the Kingdom of Bavaria.  I am quite sure this would not have happened if the principles of the gospel had been understood  by those in authority, even in Bavaria. Our elders would find a great advantage if we were better known, in presenting the gospel ^to strangers^.  We have friends through whom we might reach some of these parties if we cared to take that trouble.  I would much prefer to be represented by my friends then ^by^ my ^by^ enemies.  Bro Carlisle and I have made the acquaintence of many ofthe newspaper men in this city and we feel some confidence that they will treat us with some degree of fairness.  Mr Ranesden has introduced us and he has made a personal request that we be treated as gentlemen should be. ENDENTRY If Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon could make us a visit and introduce some of the elders to parties that he can approach, and I think John W. is favorably known to many in this country, and with all the power we can muster we can reach men that overtoss those scrubs who maltreat our elders; 99 times in a hundred simply because they think our brethren have no friends.  I would like to show them to the contrary. The power is in men to do much of themselves and I am sure the Lord has given us a few good friends in this Country I beleive it to be our duty to use every means in our power to conteract the abominable lies which ^are^ spued out of United States and find their way onto this island.  Our policy is to get acquainted, offer to ans- wer respectable questions and give our reasons for the hope we have.  We have had many interesting conversations with strangers.  I hear good reports from many parts of the mission.  Where it is practicable we try to crawl out of the back alleys and slums ^in our Conferences^ and hire halls in more respecta- ble quarters.  Where it can be done it pays in increase of congrega- tion.

And I am favorably impress ed with the idea of placing ourselves on an equal footing before the law with other Christian denomination; and ENDENTRY to avoid complication that it should be done soon as convenient, I have thought strongly of having something of the kind here in this country. It is understood that Christian ministers are licensed and we are more liable to pursecution without license.

Dear Brethern:  I am thankful for the privilege of writing to you on this auspicious day. Deeply grateful am I for the tidings of what will transfire in our loved mountain home on this the sixty second anniversary of the establishing of the church of Christ in the earth. God is merciful to His people, we live to behold a day that I did not whope would transpire within the limited span allotted time on earth.  Brethren of the Presidency and Twelve, I join you in spirit this day during your celebratiansand offerings unto God. When a boy, I rejoiced during the services of laying the capstone on the Temple at Nauvoo; as a man, I worship the Being who has brought about this great triumph to the saints; here is demonstrated their skill perseverance and industry, a blended monument of the zeal and integority of the people, a thing of beauty and a joy forever. Your own feelings will tell you how joyfully I would join you ^on^ this oc casion, but under the circumstances I could not hope or expect to attend these celebrations which precede the most complete dedicatory cerimonies which I trust are not far distant  Although far distant from the stiring scenes which have transried among you during the last ninteen months, yet I have been with you in spirit and sustained ^you^ with my prayers before the Lord. It was not difficult for one to understand the various mover which have been made and I approved of the "Manifesto" proclamations etc which have ^been^ insued by the Presidency and Twelve, unto the saints. In all these mutatitions but once have I felt the solid ground move under my feet, and that was long ago when the elders maintained that the "manifesto" not only abrogated all plural marriages but ^also^ ad- vised the brethren to break up their plural families and discard, seperate from, ignore those women who were wives anterior to the ^passage of those^ vile ^ants^ polygamy laws, as well as later marriages. ENDENTRY I have laid these matters away, and concluded it will be time enough across that bridge when I reach it. The business which devolves upon me with furnish awhile employment while I am in this land and I trust in God for all future exigencies. Perhaps more will be known in relation to the sitriahan after the anvesty is pro- I caimed, than is dreamed of now. One thing, in relations to my present feelings, is quite clear. I would rather live without all my wives, entirely seper- ate from them, than to live exclusively with any one of my wives. While I hold these feelings yet they are now and with Gods help my whole being shall be subject to "thus saith the Lord".  I am but poorly in health, and in fact all of the brethren in the office are loosing their energy, but we are still able to keep things moving and I am improving so are the brethren I believe. Summer is coming and we all feel a sensation of returning health. I am quite sure the climate here is changing for the worse and occasionally Englishmen express themselves as being and disgusted with the climate.  We left New Brighton and now occupy a house near Princes Park at a rent of two hundred dollars per year. Have used some money to purchase necessary articles for keeping house. There were a few things at 42 we could use but most everything there would not bear transportion, too old and broken. Will ^soon^ send the amount used and if you do not choose to allow it I will pay it.  Of course I do not know how you are pleased with our administration but I am well pleased with the way we are getting on.  Please send us a good writer for sub-editor and a first class printer. We are dependant on Union people, — Mr. Davis having left us — and these are hard men who calculate to get pay without much work. Bro. Anderson ought to be released as early as September ^if not before^ and the man who suceeds him ought to have experience in the field before he comes into the office.

May 6th 1892  Presidents W Woodruff G Q Cannon Jos F Smith  Dear Brethren:  The proposition to detain Bro. Anderson is impracticable for the following reasons. Bro. Osmond was here on mission two years from 1884 to 1886. He came here year last Jan. it will be two years next Jan. His health is much impared, His financial condition at home is embarassing, and under these circumstances I have arranged to release him in the near future. I presume you will look upon his case as I do. He is willing to stay, but another winter here would prove fatal to him ^I believe^; within the last three months he has been at deaths door; he now presides in London.  I have spent some forty pounds for house furniture the bills for most of it I forward you have no bills for the ten pounds Furniture etc at 42 would not bear transportation the brethren use that which we left that which is good for anything. I will pay these bills should ^you^ intimate it is my business to do so. Have taken my family notraveling to improve the health of my wife and children who have been seriously afflicted at times, hence the great expense to me. Bro. Anderson is gradually failing in health so are most of the brethren who sleep at 42; business makes it necessary for them to do so. Printers earn their wages by shirking, must be watched closely.

Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother: Your favor Feb. 15th came to hand and was perused with uncommon interest and I will answer you according to the light that is in me. First, we thank you for your kind invi- tation to attend the aniversary of your birth day Heaven has favored you and I thank God you are recovered from your recent illness and for the presservation of your life to comfort the saints and your family. I will sug- gest that your next invatation anti date your birth day, time enough ^for us^ to joni you, especially should you consider our presence necessary—rather desiriable.  Curiosity I believe is the mainspring that has brought strangers to our meetings, and I believe that, curiosity is waning; for all over the mission with about three exceptions the people feel in the districts where our people elders labor, that a mormon elder, with his gospel is a nuissance. The people do not want the gospel and while we do batptize a few—not one proselyte to each elder in the year. Still it is a fact that, the elders meet with but little but abuse. We are warning the people and ^doing^ but little else. I have felt to put a force in here—this nation, that, the people will be left without excuse, I have found not one case where the distribution of tracts has brought one soul to our meetings or into the Church. ENDENTRY So far as emigration matters are concerned, the english por- tion is rather insignificant, what ^emigrants^ there are could ship at southhampton joining german steamer at that point which could bring our Scandinavian emigration better than there present method of Conveyance, in my opinion. But this is a matter that with your permission I will examine into more particularly, not with a view of doing anything but for information pending future events.  President Woodruff, this mission is a dead beet so far as proselyting is concerned. My whole anxiety has been to warn the people, outside of that, the mission is shurnken to an insig- nificant compass. We hire halls and but few come; I am afraid there is culpable neglect on the part of the saints, many have to be nursed and ^for the elder^ to leave them—the saints—to break new ground many become cold indifferent and must have a frequent application of gospel warming pan, and I have known cases when it was impossi- ble to resussitate them. Our batteries are too light metal, the Lord can turn their ^the peoples^ indifference to interest, but we cannot.  Prest London, reports some interest among strangers there but it is comparatively little; one of the elders had been laboring for two months and thought if he could be left in that vicinity for a few weeks longer he could make one or two converts. We have to contend with supreme indifference of the people, or abuse. Your son-in-law is about correct. I am not discouraged and we have many conferences to attend within the next two months.  I could give you more detailes but these are facts as I understand the situation.  God bless you with long life future—Love to brethren, in which the brethren join.

Dear Brother:  The changed conditions in the Church educational system have rendered it desirable, in the opinion of the First Presidency and the members of the Boards of Young University and the Latter-day Saints College, of Salt Lake City, that these two institutions of learning should be consolidated, and to preserve the name of President Brigham Young it is suggested that the new establishment be known as Young Institute. It is thought the best interests of the school will be subserved by greatly reducing the number of members of the Board (say to seven); as at present it is next to impossible to get together a sufficient number to form a quorum. Under these circumstances it will be necessary for the greater portion of the members of the board of Young University to resign. We ourselves have each of us already tendered our resignation, and we write this to you to ask if you have any objections to resigning also.

Elder Brigham Young,  Dear Brother:  Your brief letter of the 17th has just reached  me. I am not surprised to hear from you of the fatigue and lameness which you feel  in consequence of the hard trip that you have taken. You have passed through a very  rough country, and if you have had many miles of road to make you have had a tedious  time.  There is nothing particularly new since I last  wrote to you, excepting that we are still progressing somewhat in our attempt to aef- fect a settlement of the Church suit; but as we progress the hunger of the officers  seems to increase. A comparison was made to us by a man not of our faith that they  reminded him of wolves sitting and licking their chops, waiting for their prey. Their  eyes glare at the mention of property with the same eagerness and hunger that wild  animals have when they scent their prey. But the Council has decided that we had  better do everything we can to effect a settlement, even if it takes all the property  that they claim. We would liked you to have been with us to have given us your views  upon the subject. It wis with great reluctance that we do this—the same reluctance  with which we have yielded our property in days past, when armed mobs have stood  ENDENTRY around and driven us from our homes and taken possession of that which the Lord had  given to us. But this will stop these painful proceedings before the Examiner, and  will perhaps be the means of saving our temples and meeting-houses and sacred places  from direct attacks, if it does not savie them entirely; at least, we hope so. The case  of course, will be carried up to the court of last resort for its decision.  My health and the health of the brethren general- ly is good. Brother Grant has not been well; but has been able to attend our two last  Councils. Yourself and Brothers Teasdale are the only ones absent now  of the Quorum.

Box 321,  Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887  Dear Brother Brigham  Your Welcome Letter of April  19 is received and I was very glad to hear  from you. I was vary much pleased with  the spirit of your Letter Now with regard to  Brother Tenney, I will say I did not know  that He had any Appointment by any bady One Except the Mission I gave him to the  Zonies, Lagoonies, Islata andc. while I was in that  country He done Nothing in the Mission after  the Rail Roading commenced And after He  came out of prision and broke down financia- lly and in spirit and health We could not Expect  him to do much at Missionary Work at present  But in coresspondence with the presidency we  have thought it Wisdom to Esstablish a  mission with the Maricopas, Pemos Papagoes and  then reach the Yaquis but not to begin with the Yaquis first. And having travelled with Tenney  and knowing that He could preach Well in spanish  I thought He would make one good hand with  a company of 4 or 6 as the case might be to Engage  in that Mission He might not be a suitable  man to Lead in it I have written to him upon  the subject and it would Meet his Mind to Engage ENDENTRY in that Mission. I did not know that he had  Labored among the Navajos or had a Mission  to them. He helped Baptise 115 Zunies and  Labored some 6 months with the Islata I am  Satisfied Brother Brigham that as the Gentilses  are so fast and so thoroughly rejecting the  Gospel that it is our Duty to more thorou- ghly commence to Esstablish Missionary Stations among the Lamanite throughout  this Western world. Now of course I do not  know what instructions you have received from  the presidency concerning your Mission or to what  Extent But as the Navajos Join on to those  Northern tribes I should think that you  ought to have the oversight of the Oribas  Moquis, Zonies Lagoonies and Islata.

Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 5, 1896.  Elder Brigham Young,  Dear Brother:  Inasmuch as you have been appointed to attend the Bluff on the 22nd and 23rd insts., we wish you to consider the following items of business while there. You may find it necessary to release the Presi- dent of the Stake and Bishop Neilsen of the Bluff Ward, in consequence of their advanced age and growing infirmities. We suggest Platt D. Lyman for President and Cumen Jones for Bishop should you find it agree- able and proper to make such changes. Of course you will consult the feelings of the people in these matters. We understand the spiritual and temporal prosperity of the Stake require a change in the adminis- trative officers.  The Burnham Ward should have another Bishop. Bro. Luther Burnham seems to consider the labor of presiding in that ward too oner- ous in his present straitened circumstances, and that a more active man would suit the people better. If you find this to be the case, make such changes as may be necessary for the spiritual and temporal prosper- ity of the people of that ward.  The Jensen case ought to be handled with care. If, on inves- tigation, you find that Bro. Jensen of Mancos was justified in not attending the San Juan Conference recently held at Fruitland, continue your investigation of the case, which he (Jensen) submitted to us, at the Stake Conference which will be held at Bluff on the 22nd and 23rd insts. ENDENTRY Use every precaution compatable with your duty, to save the feelings of Prest. Hammond and also the feelings of all those brethren who are in trouble and have to meet these charges and have judgment passed upon them.  God bless you.  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q.

Dear Brother Brigham:  We were much interested in listening to your letter of Feb. 24th, but grieved to hear that Sister Lizzie's progress towards recovery is so slow and her weakness so great. We commend your faith, and with you we believe that the promises made in her behalf will be fulfilled. You have our sincere and constant prayers that it may be so. In this feeling we are encouraged by the receipt of your telegram on President Woodruff's birthday in which you state that she is improv- ing. We trust your own health remains good. Ours, we are happy to say, is excellent.  The weather here has changed from winter to spring—dry, clear and pleasant. This gives us hope that it is the same on the coast, and if so, is more propitious for Sister Lizzie's recovery as well as more agreeable for yourself. The early advent of spring in this region has, however, given cause for considerable apprehension of a scarcity of water next season, as the snow in the mountains surrounding this and neighboring valleys is said to be far below the average.  We had a call yesterday from Mr. Kraft who gave us a full particulars concerning your situation and the condition of  Sister Young, and he spoke of your devoted attentions to her in her sickness. He told us also of the faith which you and your daughter Katie, his wife, have in relation to Sister Young's recovery. We appre- ENDENTRY ciate his kindness in calling upojn us as we were quite desirous to learn all we could about you.  Prest. Smith has been east for the last two weeks, he is ex- pected back Monday afternoon.  Of course you will have learned of the death of James T. Little His sisters were quite anxious to have him buried in temple clothing, but we could not see the propriety of permitting it.  We join in love to you all. You have our faith and prayers.

Will you kindly refer this matter to Bro. Western and who may be found at or near Fillmore, and perhaps he will take immediate steps to remove the cause of distress which now afflict the brethren.  I am pleased to inform you that success is met with by brethren in their ministerial labors in a few places in the mission. Since we con- centrated the force of the Conference in London, things are looking up a little in that city. Baptisms occur occasionally, and the brethren are pushing outdoor meet- ings with Considerable zeal, in fact, this is the rule throughout the mission, Hiring Halls is useless for the people will not come to hear the elders, but street ENDENTRY preaching seems to suit the spirit of the times better.  We are in good health and prospering in all departments to a limited extent. The office business in every particular is right up to the mark ^Mr^ Tenbroeck to the Contrary notwithstanding. We are obliged to send emigrants sterage when ^their means is limited^ they can go no other way; and we cannot send advices, particulars in numbers and items of age destination etc, matter for making out their tickets on that side of the water only as we have been doing, for we cannot cable all these particulars, ^it would be too expensive^. In future we shall write Mr. T. by the vessel preceeding the sailing of companies that, saints are expecting to sail we on such a vessel, with all the data we are in possession of, which will not be sufficient to enable him to make out the RR. tickets, for changes occur up ^to^ the day of sailing.  God is blessing our labors, and tho’ the weather is cool yet it is warm enough to bring health to me. Mrs Y is better now ^in health^ than at any time ^previous^ while residing on this Island.

Metz who wishes to be releived, person- ally, and have the Netherlands Mission account cred- ited the amount of emigration money paid for the parties named viz £ 30. 9. 6. His proposition to have the note transfered to me or to this office is altogether inadmissable but as Bro. M. felt positive that the elder would pay it, and no doubt Bro Brown is equally as sanguine, tho’ I have had my faith much shaken un- der simelar circumstances, perhaps you will do something.  The Netherlands Mission needs assistance—more elders. I found Prest. Metz in very poor health and he had but two efficient assistants Bros A. Farrell and  Hyde. Bro. Subert is not advanced in the langu- age far enough to render much help for the present. The labors of these brethren are ^at^ Amsterdam, with their hands full, indeed, a portion of the time they are badly over worked. Neither Bro. Farrell nor Hyde are in robust  health. Prest. Metz is quite feeble; poor food, cold weather, exposure and over work have made a great change in ENDENTRY rugged man. Unless the genial climate of Arizona restores him to his normal condition of health I doubt his living very long. I was more surprised to find him in this con- dition because I have known him as arough and ready pontuismans able to endure every hardship.  Bro. Farrell understands the business of the Mission and speaks the language very well. Bro. Metz has all confi- dence in him and feels sanguine that he is competent to suc- ceed him in the presidency of the Dutch or, rather Nether- land Mission. Bro F is not more than 24 years old but has much experience at home and abrodt. However the the Mission must have a presedents ^perhaps you can send a man.^ Bro. Metz must be released and will part sometime in November. The saints love him and they also love the other elders, Bro. M.  has done a good work.  More elders are needed. There are but four elders at present in the Netherland Mission and there ought to be not less than  twelve. Liege two; Holland six. From the best information I can obtain and good work can be done in that country if help is given them.  The British Mission still lives but the pulse is feeble. Turkish Mission is struggling for existence. The brethren are encouraged by the  Spirit, not externals. With a little trouble I could meet the Turk- ish Minister, it is a great thing in the world to be known, and I have noticed a revolution in the feelings of educated classes in this country.  My health is good. My daughter ^Katie^ cables she will come, she is in a distressing condition and comes for a surgical operation, I will meet her in N. Y. which I trust you will approve of.

"Elder Niels  P Larsen came here last summer on genealogical business but was so successful among his friends that he remained to assist in the mission where he has done a good work among  his relatives and acquaintances. If you  can pass him he will feel well over it, but  if not why he will either pay or give you a  note" and as we had not authority  to pass him free, we took the enclosed note  for £14.17.6, which is just the cost to this  office of sending him from Copenhagen to Utah,  and told him if any other arrangements were  made they would have to be made with you.

I also owe Brother Grant Z Bullock 3. dollars and my Sister ten pounds all of which I promised to return at an early date but the money belonging to the Spendloves ^Boy^ is not ENDENTRY quite correct, he gave me a check for ten dollars this Spring early and told one to send it to his folks it was some time before I could get a  ten dollar bill for it some time after he asked me if I had sent it.

I am grateful to you for Contents, and have failed to carry out your kind per- mission to close the printing in this office perevious to Bro Andersons departure. However we have counselled over the situation tho- roughly, I believe, and have Concluded to shoot up the press and let that ^work^ out first. Bro A. was opposed to shutting up the composing loan; ^he^ thought we could do better to keep it running for the present. I shall consider it thoroughly before I move contrary to his advise in this matter. I am strongly impressed  to leave the building, and shall work with that end in view, as the Lord opens the way and the spirit intimates.  I have called my son Albert into the office and also Bro.

He is Competant ENDENTRY to fill the place I believe, for in advance of some who have taken that department heretofore.

Another company will sail on the 5 of Nov. S.S. Nevada  Shall confine the numbers going on these vessels to 25 souls or thereabouts.

Prest Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother: I have no  desire to increase your burdens, God knows you have enough to bear, but I have been much exercised concerning a few points contained in Bro. Roberts lecture ^which he^ delivered before the mMutual iIm- provement Association on authority of Priesthood.  I quote a few a fewseveral items which have come to my mind, and in all that I say I desire to give no offensce to my brethren in any particular. I can not say there is one iota of untruth contained in the lecture, but in my judgement the lecturer does not ex- plain, sufficiently, points of vital importance. These ^points^ have a double signifficance at this period of political excitement; and ^the^ puting forth "liberal" ideas ^in political matters^ which have brought our Republic to the verge of desolution, and will ^yet^ prove an important factors in the ultimate overthrow of man made governments, vis perfect freedom to lie debanch, the stronger oppress the weak, the rich grow richer the poor grow poorer; the spirit shrinks and the body enlarge its beastly propensities, are distressing to contemplate.  Please give mey ideas consideration and send me the advice and counsel that is necessary to make ^me^ wise as a ENDENTRY serpent and harmless as a dove.  I have always believed that, when when Christs author- ized servants had it revealed unto them that a certain man was the individual to preside over the church—His church, this might be sustained, but not revoked by His people. I have the privilege of showing to God and man that, I am in harmony with that revelation and my sign of cove- nant is the evidence, which I can produce on the spot, of my unswerving allegiance to Him. All things are done by common consent which comes through obedience to the head.  "Joseph presided over the church by the voice of the  people." Very true, and the people were the church of Christ because they sustained His prophet, which is equally true.  "Joseph presided over the church etc." "The people chose to have it so." "He always filled that station by the voice of the people." These statements are all true, but I think that, with^out^ further explenation they are calculated to mis- lead the minds of our children. If it is deemed wisdom to leave these things as they are—as they appear in print, I am content. Please render me a little assistance to put the break on with a little more force.  "Eeclesiastical governments as well as civil derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." I am in- clined to think that, there is a destinction between h the ^two^ govern- ments, God calls and authorizes a man, he gathers the people and they sustain him. Men gather and appoint ^or elect^ their head. One originates in God, the other in man. ENDENTRY In comparison, God has a fine stepper properly harnessed to his ^beautifuly proportioned vehiacle^ to bear the burthen; while man has nothing but a push cart. True, majorities controle in the world and they ^the wicked^ will seek to push this doctrine upon us, on purpose to destroy the church. I know their cunning is not equal to the wisdom of God, and I pray for strength to stand when these two powers will, apparently, so nearly tie that the boldest will tremble in the conflict. A bare majority of the people may reject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con- genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receiving office on the line through which revelation can come to them. The mai- jnority who sustain the prophet by their votes, are all that is left of the church of Christ.  The agency of man consists in his having ^had^ power delegated to him to select his master. I exercise my will power by being obedient to the chosen of the Lord. I believe our youth should be taught to sustain the authorities of the church irrespective of of numbers. I fix my eyes upon you; I listen to your counsel, I try to live to have the same spirit that actuates you. The testimony of the spirit in one is that, your mistakes—should you make any—will be overruled by God for His glory and the good of His people. I beseech the Father to give me strength to follow you as you follow Christ our Lord.  Will the time ever come when a majority of those claiming mem- bership in the church—whatever object they have had in joining the church—will reject the Presidency and Apostles by vote in the general assembly of the people. I beleive the devil has that little game on foot— that is, the idea, exists in the hearts of men today.  I am content to leave things as they are for now I feel better. If I have hurt your feelings in any wise forgive me. I could not rest until I had chatted with the presidency.  I strive to do my duty in my weak way. In contrast with the brightness of the more youthful elders, there is much of the old fogy in me I find.  Love to the brethren.

Cannon and Joseph F. Smith; Dear Brethren:  Your cable received and it met our hearty endorsment. Our next company sails on the S.S. Alaska 1st prox, and numbers about thirty (30) souls: This is the last company we shall send until things look more favourable. We expect the "Arizona" to sail on the 15th prox. and she will carry a number of our elders, Bro. Jas H. Anderson among them. We shall welcome Bro. Dougall and trust that he is all sufficient to fill the place on the Star, vacated by Bro. Anderson. We could not expect him to be as efficient as Bro. Jas. in every department: he must live many years and improve every moment of his time in order to reach the plane of intelligence to which Bro. Anderson has attained. I tell you brethren I am a mere babe in current intelligence: and I believe that it needs a much more intelligent man than myself to carry on this business successfully—that is keep the mission and the Star up to their present status. I beg of you brethren to send as many missionaries this  fall as you convieniently can. I wish we had two hun- dred more men in the field. True we do not make many converts, but what we are doing requires more help. The neglected districts containing millions of ENDENTRY people who are ripe for salvation, or damnation, where the labors of efficient elders are greatly needed, may be counted by the score; the conference Presidents appeal to me in vain for more help. If agreeable to you and circumstances favour it, I shall send my  family home sometime before Christmas: and if you are willing, shall cross the water to N.Y. with them providing it will cost nothing for me to go and return. My wife is timid and will hardly be willing to sail without me. She could remain in a warm climate, which would cost money: but funds are scarce with all parties at present. Bro. Cutler and I visited Mr Ramsden today: our interview was very satisfactory. I informed him it was doubtful about our sending any more emigrants after the 1st prox. until we knew more definitely concerning actions of those whipper-snappers on the other side of the Atlantic. He agreed with us it would be unwise to send companies of emigrants, especially in consideration of the action taken in relation to the intermediate passengers on S. S. Pavonia, Cunard line. The Wisconsin and Arizona are now on the water carrying companies of our people in 2nd cabin, who may be treated the same as the Pavonia people—vis. quarintined for three weeks. Your favour, 9th inst., pertaining to Bro. Dougall just received: I thank you much for the official information and with the help of God we shall succeed in our duties so long as we are relegated to this land. My health has been precarious: the back part of my head occassioning me pain and trouble: but I am much better now. The mission is prosperous and all well.

W. Musser a few days since dated Haifa, Palestine Sept 6th 1892 in which he says he and Elder Adolf Haag arrived there on August 31st by way of Jappa. There are but two members of the Church at Haifa. Bro Grau and Sister Tegel, the latter an old lady who was desirous of donating 100000 franks for the Turkish Mission, and had paid him 500 franks of the amount.  He states that since arriving in Turkey Bro Haags health has not been good, and the day before he wrote which would be Sept 5th he complained of not feeling quite well and so went and laid down. In about an hour he awoke burning up with fever, in a few moments he was so weak he could hardly sit up and his heart was very much affected, and for a time Bro Musser was very much alarmed. He administered to him, and his heart became better but his fever was alarmingly high, he doctered him as best he could all day but about 3 oclock in the morning be became worse. They gave him a good sweating and when he woke he appeared to be better and was ENDENTRY resting niceley. and they felt confident the Lord would spare him to complete his mission and let him return to his loved onces in Zion, he thought it would be unwise to keep him in Turkey and thought the climate of Switzerland would suit him better, and I intended making the change, but it was not to be, for the next news that I received was a Telegram from Bro Haifa 8 pm received last night saying "Elder Haag is dead" signed "Muszer," which I presume is intended for Musser.  Elder Haag arrived here March 15th having left his home at Payson Feby 18 1892, he labored in the Swiss and German Mission until the beginning of July, when he started for the Turkish Mission. We shall anxiously await Bro Mussers letters with details and will on their arrival immediately write you.

President Young's apple trees are some of them loaded, and a good crop of peaches; his grape vines are loaded, I think he will have 2 or 3000 lbs of grapes this  season.  It is a general time of health in this Territory except  a company that came in from the Mississippi brought the  small pox with them, but it has not spread much yet, and we hope it will not.  A company arrived from Carson Valley on the 28th inst, they report that Murray, who was tried for murder last winter was killed by the Indians, also a man by the  name of Reddin.  Luke Johnson are about to start on a Mission of about one  month, with Ruby Valley on an exploring  expedition to open a new route to Carson Valley. They expect to meet bro Enoch Reese with a company from Carson to  cooperate with them.  Our Agricultural and Manufacturing Society are making quite an exertion to promote Home Manufactures in this Territory, as the time has come when we see that we are under the necessity of making in a great measure what  we use. The various Wards of the City and Territory are forming auxiliary branches of the same; intending to Manu- facture all they can for home consumption.  During this month Elder Parley P.

On the 29th Ulto we had a general muster and inspection of the Wells and his staff received the troops, after which a hollow square was formed and the Lieut.

We have had much excellent preaching lately by the First Presidency and others. Prest. Young has come out boldly and told this people in the name of the Lord, they must repent and be baptized for the remission of their sins. Several Wards have gone forward en masse been baptized and renewed their covenants before the Lord, and I believe the fire of a universal reformation in this Territory has been lit and will continue to burn, until a permanent foundation for good works has been laid in our midst. We must  say since the organization of this church our ears have never been saluted with more pointed Godlike sermons, than have flowed lately from Prest. Young and his counsellors.  We are happy to announce the arrival of Elders F. D. Richards, Geo. D.  Grant, N. H.

They did not seem to be sick, but chilled through, men would dig graves for their brethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed  their last rations of Flour the night before the brethren met them and they did not know that any relief was at hand.  The reason of this difficulty and suffering ink faded with the emigration is in consequence of the companies starting so late, and  the early falling of snow in the mountains. Prest. Young has universally given counsel for the emigration to start early.  The hand cart companies who started early came in well indeed better than the most sanguine could have expected.  yours truly, W.

Dear Brother,  This is the first min- ute I have attempted to write to any man in Arizona  since my arrival. I have been so overwhelmed with confer- ences, Meetings, councils and callers. But now to business:  First I will say that I have sent you a letter containing the  account of your matters at the Ferry. I do not know whether you  obtained it or not. I found your a/c at the Ferry as follows:  Your Order last drawn $222 30/100; private a/c $47 75/100 and W. Freeman's  ferriage, they said run by your order $41 75/100 total $31180.  Total Receipts of the Ferry while in the hands of Fouts $178500 one third  for the Church=$59500 $31180 leaves $28320 $6000 out for Mrs Lee leaves  $223 20/100 which was in the hands of Fouts when you settled with him un- less there is something else due him in your settlement with him.  What accounts you have sent concerning the Ferry is in the hands of the  Auditing Committee, which I have not yet had time to discuss with the  Comm. I looked over your list; I see you had put in your wagon to be  credited in your a/c $15000, so at this time I do not know whether  the 60 bus. of Grain could be allowed on that a/c. or not. I took your  letter to Eldridge concerning Mdse and he said that last year, you agreed  to send your wool to them to dispose of, until they got their pay, but  ENDENTRY said Libby to sell and  she had sold it and pocketed $150000 of the money and gone to  Philuadelphia. I do not think they feel disposed to advance any-  thing more. I understand they foreclosed mortgage on your property, and  have taken posssession of it. One of the Committee remarked to me, that  you borrowed $50000 of the Church before you left and was to  pay in wool, but they had not got it. As soon as the Comm. can get to  it, they will look over your a/cs. and do what they can with them. I  saw your Mother and had quite a talk with her. She said Libby had  sold your Library before she left. Your Mother was as well as usual. I had  a talk with Brigham. He said he had got an a/c of the wool he had sold;  had paid for it all I think in Orders. He said blank space had written  you several times but had received no answer.

I find my family well as usual, but I have hardly  had time to look one of them in the face. I received a telegram  from you from Albuquerque, which we answered.

I write to say that your letter of April 26 has just arrived,  and been read to President Taylor, and the following quotation is  his view in relation to the subject of which you speak—  "Arrangements are now being made, looking to the settlement  of some of our people in Mexico, and general instructions given  to certain parties in this matter. I would not feel at liberty to  recommend anything that would, in any way, directly or  indirectly, interfere with those affairs."  Your mother is still very low. We have buried Brother  Jacob  Gibson died last night at Sugar House Ward. Bishop  John Pack is very low, as also is your mother. The Presidency and Twelve and  families are as well as usual. But there is still consid- erable sickness among children. Remember me kindly  to your family and all inquiring friends.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, April 20, 1880.  Mr. John W. Young.  Dear Brother, I have just received  your letter this morning, and I will say  that I think it is all right and would be  a good thing if the brethren could take  contracts on the railroad, to help them- selves so that they could get bread and  means. I would like to know where  the railroad is coming. Concern- ing the telegram I will say that Prest.  Taylor's views were that the Presidents of  Stakes should have an oversight over the  Co-op. stores and contracts on the railroad.  I sent you a letter on the 12th of April  in a letter to Lot Smith, in which I gave an account of matters up to that date,  which I hope you got.  Brother William  Peterson called on me this morning, in- quiring about you and your affairs. ENDENTRY you for  beef, a bill of $369, drawn by Libby  and others of your family, which he  said that you had promised to pay,  and Libby had promised to pay him,  and she had gone off without paying  a cent, and he felt bad about it and  wanted his money. Of course I could  do nothing for him in the matter.  I think it would be well for you to  write to him about it. Since I  came home I am satisfied that Tout  is the man that got out an indict- ment against our friend in Arizona.  I got a letter from Brother Hatch, say- ing that Brother Tenney had sent  somebody to borrow 100 head of cows of  Brother St. John.  But we think the people who have gone  there should do what they can to help  raise the means to help pay for it.  Then I shall send to the Presidents  ENDENTRY Salt lake City, May 26, 1881.  Elder John W. Young.  Dear Brother, After parting with  you last night, I went into the office  this morning and examined all of my  files of letters to you and Brother A. M.  Tenney. I find copies of six to A. M.  Tenney and four to you, and I read them  all thoroughly through, for I have copies  of all my letters both to him and you.  I wanted to see what I had written  to him which cast such reflections  upon you to cause you grief, and I  failed to find anything in any of  them to cast reflections on you.  You seemed to feel grieved that I had  not written to you.  I have copies  of letters which I wrote to you April 20,  May 6 and 27, and June 14, 1880,  and I have only received two from you ENDENTRY and bishops to get together what ti- thing stock there is in the different  settlements and use it as a loan to  pay on the purchase until it can  be secured. You ask me for coun- sel. My counsel would be concern- ing your temporal affairs, not to  involve yourself, any more than you  can possibly help, in debt, and  write to those whom you owe and  have promised to pay, and give them  an explanation and tell them  what you can do and what you  cannot, for when we promise  and do not fulfil it creates hard  feelings, as I saw was the case with  Brother Peterson this morning.  As you say, so say I, that I  am so full of councils, meetings,  and business that I have hardly  time to write to anybody.  Remember me kindly to Lula ENDENTRY and all my friends with you.  I do not know when this will  reach you.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff  answered  May 31 1880  75+125+67=267 ENDENTRY since I left Arizona.  I have  copies of six which I wrote to A. M.  Tenney, in nearly all of which I in- quired about you, and wished to be  remembered to you, and asked for your  address.  I name this to show  you that I have written to you and  enquired about you, whether or not  you have received my letters.  I hope,  if your business will permit, that  you will occasionally write to me,  and I will answer all letters that  I recieve from you.  My respects to all your family.

Some short time ago Elder Payson  was notified to take a mission to Germany, to leave here on  9th of Next April.  He replied to you saying he would be  ready.  At that time his Bishop had promised him, so  he states, to take care of his family during his absence.  He  has since called upon Bro. Richards and states that the  Bishop has now told him he cannot help his family while  he is absent.  Bro. Allisback is quite a poor man, and  wishes to know what he is to do, as he cannot do anything  towards leaving his family any supplies.  Most of the  German brethren called are poor men. ENDENTRY Rec'd Dec 17 1888 and  Ans'd  Dec  28 1888  I believe that more Elders have been called  from Payson during the past two years than from  any other place of its size, and probably the bishop  feels he has too heavy a load to carry.

Dear President Woodruff:  I forward herewith a letter just received from Dr. Armenag Shil Hagopian of Aleppo, Syria, Turkey. Bro. Hagopian was here about two years ago, at which time I think you met him. He is now in charge of the branch at Aleppo.  Some months ago he sent me a letter descriptive of the hardships they were undergoing and he lamented very much because the Church had not assisted them to get out of Turkey. I wrote him explaining that the members there did not give any evidence that they would remain true should they come here, and called his attention to the fact that all other people in other lands who had joind the Faith would perhaps follow with the same request. But I told him to write me the condition of affairs there and I would forward it to you. It seems now that persecutions have ceased somewhat  that they are not so persistent. Several members left the Church because I was sent for to leave that land when the trouble was on and they were not sent for.  ENDENTRY I left there in December of 1895.  I am of the opinion that permission could be had from the government for our faith to be freely taught there. I have a petition in asking for the Consulship at Beyrout and if I am successful I will try and open the way for the preaching of the Gospel in that land, if you see fit. That is, I will do all I can to obtain these permissions and the license to print or spread our literature.  I am your humble servant in the Gospel  E. W. Robinson ENDENTRY Big Cottonwood.

It being possible that ^you^ might feel lead to write  an epistle to the saints in that land as there  are several items in this letters as well as  in Bro.

For this reason I have a great desire to write to  President Woodruff and also to our Liverpool, but  I cannot write English and if I write turkish I suppose they can- not read it. For this reason I can only be patient and wait, for such  information as God gives to help us in striving forward. For our  desire is very great to meet with you in Zion, if possible, and  there see you face to face: Oh, my dear brethren, dont we  ever come into your rememberance, how there was a little church  in Zara?, and dont you ever wonder what condition they are  in? aAre they alive or are they dead? Are they backsliding or are they  making headway, or what kind of exhortations do they, need? You  ENDENTRY know the needs of this country very well. Because the wolves and  the tares are among us it ^is^ hard to live spiritually as we should and as we are among the weakest how much ^more^ need have we not  of listening to the voice of God and the advise of hHis Servants,  so that through ^your^ medium we ^may^ receive the word and revalations  of God and be a become blessed with spiritual blessings. For it is known  to you that although a plant is planted in the tops of the mountains  yet of the servants of hHim hwho plants attend to the plant and  nurish it with the rains from heaven it will grow better  and be more fruitful. We may have many teachers but you have  begotton us in the Gospel, and we desire your prayers and help for  the good of the little church here started so that by the help of  God and His grace we may be faithful to the end. Amen.  Dear Brethern I desire to communicate to you both  the spiritual and temporal condition of the church. We praise God  for His kindness to us in preserving us from destruction. For no  matter how many souls have been killed and how manyuch proper- ty has been destroyed, here in Zara we have been protected by the Gov- ernment and the city Fathers. But yet though we are all alive we  never feel safe. We feel we are but strangers in this land and often  with tears in our eyes we pray to God for his blessings deliverance  and that we may soon meet with you in Zion and behold that beau- tiful land and the temple of God and its blessings and the bles- sings of that land as you write to us.  Yea Lord come quickly and  save us from the sins of Babylon ^and bring^ us to that Holy City Amen.  Spiritually our little church is growing. We are now 18 members  6 males and 12 females. We meet every Sunday in fasting and  prayer and partake of the Lord’s supper and exhort one another to  faithfulness. Besides this we meet every ^first^ Thursday in the month in ENDENTRY regular fast and privately other days and in this way the Lord  gives us pattience and grace to be faithful.  After this Brother to Nishan Sherinian writes of a Brother Constanti- nople and not obtaining means he made shipwreck of his  faith and turned to the Seventh-day Advents. Upon returning to Zara he introduced his new doctrine which was promptly rejected by  the church. As Bro. Nishan says: "he brought doctrines that we never  received from you". Bro. Nishan asks how to deal with him as he  still claims his preisthood and says he has only perfected his doctrine  or faith.  Please answer this. This man Nigoghorus was an Elder  and Bro. Nishan a preist. I have wrote to know his present authority.  Brother Nishan asks two questions: viz: About the Sabath day and  about the washing of feet. He says he will not alow these new feature  until he know^s^ whether or not they are excepted practices in Zion. He  holds close to the faith we delivered to him. Bro. Nishan further relates  a sad story of one of our sisters named Meriam Kizirin who was forci- ble taken by the authorities and married to an outsider, an Armenian, who  now prevents her from attending meetings. She had her own home and was  comfortable. This can be done in Turkey owing to their peculiar in- stitutions and yet we can have no redress because we are not  recognized as a church. He closes thus: "And now dear  Brethern we particularly ask you all to fast and pray for us  that we may in the near future ^may be freed^ from Babylon and that He  will deliver us from all danger and sin while we shall re- main here. May the grace of God be with us all. Amen.  Needing Your prayers I remain your Brother in Christ.  Nishan Shirinian, Zara, Sivus Vilayet, Turkey.  I will only add that whatever may be said of the  Armenian race we beleive there are many good people therr and that  Brother Stauffer and I can faithfully testify that Bro. Nishan Sherinian  is a true saint and a worthy representative of our cause in that far  off land. He believed when I testified to him and at once excepted the truth  He has performed a good mission in company with Elder Stauffer to Merrivan.  I am as always your humble Servant.  F. F. Hintze.

P.O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 7, 1897.  Beloved Brethren and Sisters in Turkey:  We have lately received a number of letters from various brethren addressed to Bro. Lefvon S. Abraham. In these letters a number of questions are sprung concerning your condition and also asking about a future opportunity of gathering to some place in your own land.  First, we learn that the different branches of the Church in Turkey need a fuller organization, this has been ordered to be corrected through the office in Armenag S. Hagobian. President Hago- bian should make a wvisit to the different branches of the church and ordain a few worthy brethren to the office of elders and some to the lower priesthood so that there may be workers in each branch to supply the necessary spiritual food and to preach the Gospel with authority to those not acqiuainted with our doctrines. There are also some difficul- ties that should be straightened out so that all might work as one in Jesus Christ our Lord.  It is probable that before long some elders will be sent there again to labor, and we hope you will receive them as the servants of the living God sent to you to minister in the ordinances of life and salvation for your good and for the good of the nations in that far off part of the world. For the Gospel of Christ must be preached in all places according to the will of the Father before the end will come. Dear Brethren and Sisters, you are inclined to be impatient, as though you alone had troubles to endure. This you should not be. The saints have troubles in ENDENTRY all the world, some more, some less, but all have to exercise patience and by so doing show their devotion to God and His cause, and their works will in tijme shine forth out of the darkness that surrounds the world. God will be glorified through our labors and our love of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. Satan is pressing the saints everywhere possible. He knows his time is short and he loses no opportunity to oppress the saints and if possible to overcome. This we know he cannot, but he will try, and we must resist evil and do good, labor faithfully and diligently and never tire, and although we cannot do as we like, let us not forget that this work is of God. He guides and he will in- spire his servants to mogve at the right time and in the right place. Wherefore, let us love, respect and pray for His servants that they may have the Holy Spirit to guide them and that the saints may have the Com- forter to help them to understand their counsels and to carry them out. This work is great. We mean the work of redemption, and the laborers are few in comparison to the greatness of the work. Calls for elders and Gospel knowledge are extensive and where the nations seem ripe to havrvest many are sent and many precious souls are redeemed from the false doc- trines and traditions of the world and as soon as the way seems clear the work in Palestine are made great promises, and if you remain faithful you will be instrumental by your prayers, faith and works to help fulfil many fof the glorious promises. Teach your children as best you can the Gospel of Christ, so that when they are eight years old they can be baptized and confirmed members of Hic Church, for so has God commanded us in these days. And until you can be gathered to one place where you can have the home rule, the laws and privileges of the country affords, let your children attend the Protestant schools and learn to read and write and do the best you can for them, and God will give the children sufficient of His Spirit to discern good from evil. Let dfather and mother teach and exhort them ENDENTRY at home about the Gospel, and the Protestants will have no power over the children to lead them astray. God has much good among all nations and this he will consecrate for the upbuilding of His kingdom. We are all His children and He has joy in good works and in the progress of His children and the saints above all should be fully tolerant and observant, and kind and good, always speaking the truth, do right, and above all, be virtuous in thought and deed.  Of the young sisters of whom you write, we would say it is best not to give them in marriage to any bust saints, if possible. Let them rather wait the time of the Lord. Good men will be found in time. It is not good for saints and sinners to be bound together. Be patient in well-doing. These questions about the children and young sisters are the same as we find among the saints in all lands where they are scatt- ered, and they have to abide the Lord's time until they can be changed in the proper way. We do not build school-houses nor support schools only where the saints locally are able to do so; it is not in the line of our work, but we sustain the laws and institutions of the country where we go, and find that good results follow, for so the Lord has revealed to us.  We hope and pray to God that a way may be opened, that a gathering place for our people may be found somewhere in the promised land. For as we are of Israel we feel the promises are unto us and we look forward to the day when God will move upon the rulers in Turkey to set apart a place for us to live, and there acknowledge us as a people and give us liberal government and such privileges as insure peace and prosperity to us and the nation. Do not despair, Latter-day Saints, were you in countries ruled by some of the Christian potentates, you would not have as much liberty as you now have, neither could our hopes be so bright for the future. For priestcraft and sin and misrule are very great in many nations, so much so that we cannot preach the Gospel there at all. ENDENTRY Be sure we will do all we can for you, you are of us; we are all one body in Christ; we have one Lord; we all drink at the same fountain; we are all looking for redemption through the only name given under heaven whence comes salvation. Now that our faith is one and our hope the same, let us seek to be filled with the love of God. Let us always seek profitable conversations, leaving mysteries alone. Read the scriptures dfor they are profitable to us for instruction. And more particularly let us seek for the possession of the Spirit ogf God to be our guide and to increase our testimonies. Do not discuss the time of the coming of Christ in an unprofitable manner. There is a time appointed, and God only knows it. He has not revealed it. But the appointed time will surely come long before most people are prepared. This we know, it is not far distant, for the signs of his coming are now very plain. But there is yet much to do to prepare for his coming that great event. Many of the honest have not yet heard of His great Latter-day work. Zion must be fully established. Jerusalem must be rebuilt by the Jews, the ten tribes must return from the north, the American Indians, who are of the house of Israel must be converted and become workers in His cause. And many more of the different branches of the House of Israel must return to the promised lands and be prepared to meet Him and to receive Him. FRoor He will be their King when He comes. God's words must all be fulfilled and we must wait patiently and labor in the fear of God that we may be with His holy company when He comes. For hHe Wwill come in the clouds and save His saints while His angels will reap the earth and cleanse it fr from sin.  Brother here, is a faithful and humble member of the church. He has a great desire to do good. His whole soul is laboring to do you good, and when he has learned the English language he will return to you and be instrumental in doing much good, if he remains faithful. He has given us much comfort concerning the saints in Turkey and his labors here in Zion in your behalf will be of great benefit to you in time to come.

In regard to Elder B Young who will have reached You ere this, will give You all information in connection with Him, Wilby is still with His Uncle John W Young at 22 Portland Place, ^London^.  We received a letter from Him last night, in which He says Am getting better everyday and beginning to feel like myself once more,  He said in His Letter that S M Barrett is quite sick , Your instructions, in relation to Wilbys future developments will be adhered to Elder Star has been issued since Wilby left for London and this Weeks number is all ready for the Press, Brother Taylor thinks with the help of the Brethren He will get along.  You said in Your last letter to President Young You had not been advised as to how many Elders would be needed for the Scandinavian Mission I wrote to President Christiansen, receiving His answer yesterday, in which He said the number needed, would be Twelve Sweeds, Ten Danes, and Eight Norweigens, He said He had forwarded some names to this office ENDENTRY early in January of Elders in He thought would make good Missionaries, which I have looked for, but failed to find. He said in His Letter the Financial Condition of the Mission is very poor, saying their office held Notes of several Parties in Utah and other places, asking the question what He should do in the matter,  I thought of writing for Him to send to Your Office, the full particulars of the Matter, and You would advise Him We have several applications coming in from different parties, asking the Rates to points in Arizona, if Our Agents in Utah could answer this question by stating something near the amount, it would confer a favor. Last Sunday I visited the NewCastle Conference, the Meetings being held at Stockton on Tues, the Brethren said they had sparead around three thousand hand bills, advertising the Conference, some few strangers were  present who had come on the invitation of their friends, not one had come, as the Brethren thought and ^through^ their advertising. I spent nine months last Winter and Spring in this Conference being there during the great Strike of the Coal Miners, which affected most of the Iron and Steel works in that region also the Shipbuilding, Stockton itself have six iron, and two steel plants, each plant employing a thousand men once upwards today the two steel plants are working, while the six iron plants are all idle, there being no demand for iron, out of eleven of our Brethren living in Stockton only one is in Work, the President of the Conference, said they would have to give up renting their Hall, as Himself, and Elders have had to pray most of the expenses, of that and the Conference House, one of the members of the Branch is now in the Hospital with the Small Pox it seems almost impossible for young Men to get work in this country, it looks like a preconcerted plan, among the employers, not to employ them, which enforces them to enlist in the Army, they are taken to Egypt, and other places where it is said a large percentage of them die off not being acclimated I saw quite a number of young Soldiers parting with their mothers, Sisters, and friends while in the Manchester Stateion on Tuesday last  I expect the Saints are looking at Home are looking forward to a Glorious time at the Dedication of the Temple.

The Brethern for Scandinavia leave in the morning. I wrote a few weeks ago in regard to what rules are observed in Releasing Presidents of the Mission on the Continent. President Farrell and Elder Wm Hyde of the Netherland Mission left their Homes some time in Feb 1891 and have been hinting to us in regard to their Release. We expect a small company to Emigrate from tha mission, not hearing from you in regard to this matter, I have taken the liberty to ask President Farrell to name some one to take His place, that Himself and Elder Hyde can be relesed to accompany there Saints Home. I have been in receipt of  Letters from President Fred Clawson, of the London Conference, speaking of Elder E. J. Farnes now laboring in that Conference, of His financial condition being very low, I learned while in London about two months ago He had given His note for four pounds borrowed money,  He receives no assistance from Home, and has been borrowing ever since. The Elders there feel they learn all they can stand up to, and cannot help him any more, Elder Farnes is 56 years old, and can do very little walking, one of His feet troubles Him very much ENDENTRY President He is not a man of sound judgement, and very little wisdom in discharging His duties. I have sent Him His Release to Sail on the Grant Y Bullock of the Birmingham Conference has received a Letter from His Bishop, that His mother lies in a critical condition, as regards Her Health, with no hopes of recovery  Elder Bullock left His Home in the latter part of June 1891. I have Released Him to sail May 6th.  President Christiansen of the Scandinavian ^mission^ is desirous of returning Hom, having left His Home in April 1891 He has recommended Elder C A Carlquist to succeed Him. I have sent Elder Carlquist a Letter of Appointment, to that effect Elder Christiansen will leave for Home sometime in May or June.  I was in Albert C Young, of that Conference it being the day set apart for our Fasting and Prayer in the British Mission, in reading an extract from a Letter written by President Woodruff dated July 8th 1840, when three or  four of the Twelve were present at the Manchester Conference in speaking of the numbers in the different Quorums of the Priesthood and also of the Saints, present, and the numbers attending the meetings, I couldnt help butcontrast compare it with the number of to- day, Albert C told me in their meeting their now four Saints was their usual number beside the Elders, Albert C, and myself look the 9 A. M Train to Oldham where the Saints had been notified to hold their Fast Meeting, which commence at 10, their were between Thirty and Forty present. The Spirit of God was manifest to a great extent, the Saints felt to rejoice in having the privelege with the Saints in Zion, to meet in a Spirit of Humility and Prayer, a feeling of good Will, and Peace, pervaded the Hearts of the Saints, a vote was taken, to forgive, and make right; all differences that might exist, in the Hearts of any of the Saints, against each other, during the meeting Seven Persons were Confirmed, out of ten who had been Baptized during the week, all being young persons between the ages of 16 and 27, most of them bearing their Testimony with the others of the Blessing of the Almighty in their behalf by reports I have been receiving from the Presidents in Great Britain and the Continent it was a time of general rejoicing, Zion and Her People are being as a City set upon a Hill, the news of the dedica- tion of the Great Temple is being spread through the Land, the Papers of the World having taken the matter up to a great extent, I hope the Spirit of Love and Good Will that now exists, will continue with the Saints, for evermore.

The Proprietors, nor  Foremen, could do nothing with them, the Government had to arrest the leaders, and put them in prison.
