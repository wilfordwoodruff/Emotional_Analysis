Your own feelings will tell you how joyfully I would join you ^on^ this oc casion, but under the circumstances I could not hope or expect to attend these celebrations which precede the most complete dedicatory cerimonies which I trust are not far distant   during the last ninteen months, yet I have been with you in spirit and sustained ^you^ with my prayers before the Lord. It was not difficult for one to understand the various mover which have been made and I approved of the "Manifesto" proclamations etc which have ^been^ insued by the Presidency and Twelve, unto the saints. In all these mutatitions but once have I felt the solid ground move under my feet, and that was long ago when the elders maintained that the "manifesto" not only abrogated all plural marriages but ^also^ ad- vised the brethren to break up their plural families and discard, seperate from, ignore those women who were wives anterior to the ^passage of those^ vile ^ants^ polygamy laws, as well as later marriages.

His health is much impared, His financial condition at home is embarassing, and under these circumstances I have arranged to release him in the near future.

First, we thank you for your kind invi- tation to attend the aniversary of your birth day Heaven has favored you and I thank God you are recovered from your recent illness and for the presservation of your life to comfort the saints and your family.

The people do not want the gospel and while we do ba a few—not one proselyte to each elder in the year. Still it is a fact that, the elders meet with but little but abuse. We are warning the people and ^doing^ but little else. I have felt to put a force in here—this nation, that, the people will be left without excuse, I have found not one case where the distribution of tracts has brought one soul to our meetings or into the Church.

But this is a matter that with your permission I will examine into more particularly, not with a view of doing anything but for information pending future events.   as proselyting is concerned. My whole anxiety has been to warn the people, outside of that, the mission is shurnken to an insig- nificant compass. We hire halls and but few come; I am afraid there is culpable neglect on the part of the saints, many have to be nursed and ^for the elder^ to leave them—the saints—to break new ground many become cold indifferent and must have a frequent application of gospel warming pan, and I have known cases when it was impossi- ble to resussitate them. Our batteries are too light metal, the Lord can turn their ^the peoples^ indifference to interest, but we cannot.   there but it is comparatively little; one of the elders had been laboring for two months and thought if he could be left in that vicinity for a few weeks longer he could make one or two converts. We have to contend with supreme indifference of the people, or abuse. Your son-in-law is about correct.

It is thought the best interests of the school will be subserved by greatly reducing the number of members of the Board (say to seven); as at present it is next to impossible to get together a sufficient number to form a quorum. Under these circumstances it will be necessary for the greater portion of the members of the board of Young University to resign.

ENDENTRY  Recd April 30 And May 4           ute I have attempted to write to any man in Arizona  since my arrival. I have been so overwhelmed with confer- ences, Meetings, councils and callers. But now to business:  First I will say that I have sent you a letter containing the  account of your matters at the Ferry. I do not know whether you  obtained it or not. I found your a/c at the Ferry as follows:  Your Order last drawn $222 30/100; private a/c $47 75/100 and W. Freeman's  ferriage, they said run by your order $41 75/100 total $311 Total Receipts of the Ferry while in the hands of Fouts $1785 for the Church=$595 $223 20/100 which was in the hands of Fouts when you settled with him un- less there is something else due him in your settlement with him.  What accounts you have sent concerning the Ferry is in the hands of the  Auditing Committee, which I have not yet had time to discuss with the  Comm. I looked over your list; I see you had put in your wagon to be  credited in your a/c $150 the 60 bus. of Grain could be allowed on that a/c. or not. I took your  letter to Eldridge concerning Mdse and he said that last year, you agreed  to send your wool to them to dispose of, until they got their pay, but  ENDENTRY  she had sold it and pocketed $1500 Phil thing more. I understand they foreclosed mortgage on your property, and  have taken posssession of it. One of the Committee remarked to me, that  you borrowed $500 pay in wool, but they had not got it. As soon as the Comm. can get to  it, they will look over your a/cs. and do what they can with them. I  saw your Mother and had quite a talk with her. She said Libby had  sold your Library before she left. Your Mother was as well as usual. I had  a talk with Brigham. He said he had got an a/c of the wool he had sold;  had paid for it all I think in Orders. He said blank space had written  you several times but had received no answer. I told them I thought it was in  consequence of the mails. S I saw her mother to-day. She said she was looking for Lula to come home on  a visit. We had an excellent conference; a good spirit prevailed; a  large attendance. In the organization of the Young Men's M. I. Ass W. Woodruff was appointed the Sup counselors. I find my family well as usual, but I have hardly  had time to look one of them in the face. I received a telegram  from you from Albuquerque, which we answered. I saw a letter  to the Council in which you said, that you had more missionaries  than you wanted to hold the claims, and was sending some into  the vineyard. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Direct  to Salt Lake.

ENDENTRY      your letter this morning, and I will say  that I think it is all right and would be  a good thing if the brethren could take  contracts on the railroad, to help them- selves so that they could get bread and  means. I would like to know where  the railroad is coming. Concern- ing the telegram I will say that Prest.  Taylor's views were that the Presidents of  Stakes should have an oversight over the  Co-op. stores and contracts on the railroad.  I sent you a letter on the 12th of April  in a letter to Lot Smith, in which I gave an account of matters up to that date,  which I hope you got.

Of course I could  do nothing for him in the matter.  I think it would be well for you to  write to him about it. Since I  came home I am satisfied that Tout  is the man that got out an indict- ment against our friend in Arizona.  I got a letter from Brother Hatch, say- ing that Brother Tenney had sent  somebody to borrow 100 head of cows of  Brother St. John.

Nishan asks how to deal with him as he  still claims his preisthood and says he has only perfected his doctrine  or faith.  Please answer this. This man Nigoghorus was an Elder  and Bro. Nishan a preist. I have wrote to know his present authority.  Brother Nishan asks two questions: viz: About the Sabath day and  about the washing of feet. He says he will not alow these new feature  until he know^s^ whether or not they are excepted practices in Zion. He  holds close to the faith we delivered to him. Bro. Nishan further relates  a sad story of one of our sisters named Meriam Kizirin who was forci- ble taken by the authorities and married to an outsider, an Armenian, who  now prevents her from attending meetings. She had her own home and was  comfortable. This can be done in Turkey owing to their peculiar in- stitutions and yet we can have no redress because we are not  recognized as a church.

Dear Brethren and Sisters, you are inclined to be impatient, as though you alone had troubles to endure. This you should not be. The saints have troubles in ENDENTRY  and by so doing show their devotion to God and His cause, and their works will in ti world. God will be glorified through our labors and our love of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. Satan is pressing the saints everywhere possible. He knows his time is short and he loses no opportunity to oppress the saints and if possible to overcome. This we know he cannot, but he will try, and we must resist evil and do good, labor faithfully and diligently and never tire, and although we cannot do as we like, let us not forget that this work is of God. He guides and he will in- spire his servants to mo Wherefore, let us love, respect and pray for His servants that they may have the Holy Spirit to guide them and that the saints may have the Com- forter to help them to understand their counsels and to carry them out. This work is great. We mean the work of redemption, and the laborers are few in comparison to the greatness of the work. Calls for elders and Gospel knowledge are extensive and where the nations seem ripe to ha many are sent and many precious souls are redeemed from the false doc- trines and traditions of the world and as soon as the way seems clear the work in Palestine are made great promises, and if you remain faithful you will be instrumental by your prayers, faith and works to help fulfil many  promises. Teach your children as best you can the Gospel of Christ, so that when they are eight years old they can be baptized and confirmed members of Hic Church, for so has God commanded us in these days. And until you can be gathered to one place where you can have the home rule, the laws and privileges of the country affords, let your children attend the Protestant schools and learn to read and write and do the best you can for them, and God will give the children sufficient of His Spirit to discern good from evil.

Good men will be found in time. It is not good for saints and sinners to be bound together. Be patient in well-doing. These questions about the children and young sisters are the same as we find among the saints in all lands where they are scatt- ered, and they have to abide the Lord's time until they can be changed in the proper way. We do not build school-houses nor support schools only where the saints locally are able to do so; it is not in the line of our work, but we sustain the laws and institutions of the country where we go, and find that good results follow, for so the Lord has revealed to us.   place for our people may be found somewhere in the promised land. For as we are of Israel we feel the promises are unto us and we look forward to the day when God will move upon the rulers in Turkey to set apart a place for us to live, and there acknowledge us as a people and give us liberal government and such privileges as insure peace and prosperity to us and the nation. Do not despair, Latter-day Saints, were you in countries ruled by some of the Christian potentates, you would not have as much liberty as you now have, neither could our hopes be so bright for the future.

Read the scriptures  let us seek for the possession of the Spirit o to increase our testimonies. Do not discuss the time of the coming of Christ in an unprofitable manner. There is a time appointed, and God only knows it. He has not revealed it. But the appointed time will surely come long before most people are prepared. This we know, it is not far distant, for the signs of his coming are now very plain. But there is yet much to do to prepare for  of the honest have not yet heard of His great Latter-day work.

His whole soul is laboring to do you good, and when he has learned the English language he will return to you and be instrumental in doing much good, if he remains faithful.
