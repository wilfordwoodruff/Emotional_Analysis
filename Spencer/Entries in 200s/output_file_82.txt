 REMARKSBy Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Sun-day, January 25, 1857.[REPORTED BY J. B. LONG.]I am requested to get up and address you a short time. I do not know that I will be able tomake this large assembly of people hear me thismorning, but I will do the best I can to accom-plish it. I feel that it is a very good sign to seeso many people out to meeting, it seems as thoughthey felt interested in meeting together to receiveinstructions; to see as crowded a house as this isthis morning, is a proof that there is an increasinginterest resting upon the people to hear the word ofthe Lord and receive instructions from the servantsof God, and I do hope, brethren and sisters, thatwhat instructions you do receive, you will prize,lay it up, and practise it, whether it be muchor little.I realize that the salvation of this people doesnot depend upon the great amount of teaching, instruction, or revelation that is given unto them,but their salvation depends more upon their obey-ing the commandments of God which are givenunto them, their becoming a doer of the word, andfollowing the counsel of those who are set tolead them. We certainly have a great amount ofteaching, of instruction, of principle, of revela-tion, and of the word of God, which has beengiven unto this people; not only that which is re-corded in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, Bookof Doctrine and Covenants, the Church History,but we have day by day, and night by night, in-structions given unto us, we have a little here anda little there, a discourse to-day and another to-night, and we are continually receiving instruc-tions from the servants of God. We receive in-structions in our Ward meetings, and almost everytime a few of us meet together, we do so for thepurpose of receiving the word of the Lord.It appears to me then that we are certainlya favoured people, and that we are having a greatdeal of important instruction, such as is calcu-lated to lead us unto salvation. Inasmuch thenas we have been called upon to reform, or to ad-vance and to grow in the principles of eternal life,and to become holy in our lives, I hope there isnone of us but that will take hold with our wholesoul and carry out the instruction, and try topractise it in word and deed. We frequently hearremarks made about the reformation being over,and about their having got through with it in thisplace or in that place, but the amount of it isthere never will be any end to the reformation, orin other words, there will never be any end to ouradvancement, there will be no end to our improve-ment nor to our increase, neither in time nor in alleternity.If we act up to our privileges as a people, wehave no more time to lose or to spend in an un-profitable manner. We should not act indifferentlywith regard to the blessings which the Lord isoffering unto us, and which we have the privilegeof obtaining; we should labour with all our mightto build up the kingdom of God, that we may se-cure unto ourselves every blessing necessary forour salvation. We live in an important day; it isa day of mercy and a day of great blessings untous as a people, and we should appreciate it assuch.I have reflected a good deal within the last fewmonths, and especially while sitting and listeningto the teachings of the First Presidency, theTwelve, and the Elders of Israel in their variousspheres and callings in which they are called toact. In my prayers and reflections I have thoughtmuch of our present position, and I have con-cluded that if we do not enjoy the Holy Spirit, andif the vision of our mind is not open to compre-hend the things of God, and the power which isbeing made manifest for our benefit and good, thatwe are in great danger of suffering loss; we shouldsee more fully theimportance of taking hold withour might, and then, as br. Kimball says, the HolySpirit of God would be diffused through our wholebodies and through the whole body and Churchof Christ.I feel and see the importance of this work, andI see the necessity of our walking up to the lineof our duty, that we may live and walk daily inthe light of the Lord. I realize that the Presi-dency of this church stand between this peopleand the Lord, for they are the head, and I realizethat God reveals to them His will, and thereforewe should look unto them for light and for infor-mation. The head may be full of light, of inspir-ation, revelation and of the mind and will of God,but if those officers who stand next to them, andif we ourselves are asleep in relation to our duties,and are not in a fit state to receive that light, doyou not see that the river is dammed up at thehead? There is no current or medium wherebythe light may flow to the limbs and branches of the body.I realize that it is the duty, not only of us whohold the Priesthood but of this people generally,to present ourselves in humility and faith beforethe Lord, that we may obtain the blessings whichare in readiness for us, and we can obtain all thelight, the knowledge, the faith, the intelligenceand power which is necessary for our salvation byhumility, obedience and submission to the will ofGod. We should attend to this in order that ourminds may be prepared and our bodies become fitsubjects for the reception of the Holy Ghost, sothat the Spirit of God may flow freely through thewhole body from the head to the foot. Then whenthis is the case we will all see alike, feel alike,and be alike, and become one as far as the Gospeland kingdom of God is concerned, as the Fatherand Son are one, and then this people will beginto see the position and relationship which webear towards each other and towards God, and weshall feel the importance of attending to our du-ties and we will willingly step forward and im-prove our time, make good use of our talents andobtain the blessings that the Lord has for us toenjoy; but do you not see that if the people areasleep and slothful and not living up to their priv-ileges, and the Spirit of God begins to flow fromthe head to the body that it soon becomes ob-structed and dammed up?We may trace this principle through the Churchand kingdom of God, and you may carry it intothe family government, and you will find it asbr. Kimball has already presented it to us. It islike the vine with its limbs, its branches andits twigs. This is a very good figure to teach us theprinciple of righteousness.In order for us to be prepared to do the will ofGod and be in a position to build up his kingdomupon the earth, and to carry out his purposes, wemust not only become united and act as the heartof one man, but we must obtain the Holy Spiritof God and the mind and will of God concerningus, and be governed and controlled by it in all ofour movements and acts in order to be safe andto secure unto ourselves salvation.If I do not enjoy the Holy Spirit, there is some-thing the matter, and I should labour until that isremoved, for I consider that to be the first turn-ing key, and we should do this to prove that weare honest before the Lord, and that we desire todo right in our minds and in our hearts. Yetas I have said before unless that Spirit is with uswe do not know whether we are doing rightor wrong.[Prest. Kimball: Shut that door and let it re-main so, for I tell you there is no one can enjoythe peaceful influence of the Holy Spirit wherethere is confusion; and I am sure this congrega-tion cannot while that door is going clickitty-clack.]-As I was remarking, unless we do obtain theHoly Spirit we are in danger every step we take,we are not safe neither are we in a con-dition to build up the kingdom of God or do Hiswork. I consider that the Lord requires this atthe hand of every man and woman in Israel, everyLatter Day Saint, that we first obtain the HolySpirit then bring forth the fruits of it unto salva-tion, then you will see this people keep theircovenants and obey the commandments of God;this is the duty of all of us, and we should liveour religion and follow its dictates. When this isdone, you will see this people awake and bringforth works of righteousness, then they will havefaith and they will have power, and rise up andthe power and glory of God will be made mani-fest through such instruments as the Lord haschosen in this dispensation upon the earth, intowhose hands He has committed the Holy Priest-hood.Ask any people, nations, kingdoms or genera-tions of men the question and they will tell youthey are seeking for happiness, but how arethey seeking for it? Take the greatest portionof mankind as an ensample and how are theyseeking for happiness? By serving the devil asfast as they can, and almost the last Being or thing that the children of men worship, and thelast Being whose laws they want to keep are thelaws of the God of heaven. They will not wor-ship God nor honour his name, nor keep his laws,but blaspheme his name from day to day, andnearly all the world are seeking for happiness bycommitting sins, breaking the law of God andblaspheming his name and rejecting the onlysource whence happiness flows.If we really understood that we could not ob-tain happiness by walking in the paths of sin andbreaking the laws of God, we should then see thefolly of it, every man and every woman wouldsee that to obtain happiness we should go to workand perform the works of righteousness, and dothe will of our Father in heaven, for we shall re-ceive at his hand all the happiness, blessing, glory, salvation, exaltation and eternal lives that we everdo receive either in time or eternity.We should understand that we should not de-ceive ourselves in this matter, for if we deceive ourselves we shall suffer the loss. We may just as well search our own hearts, and at once re-solve that we will do the works of righteousness,honor our Father in heaven, do our duty to God and man, take hold and build up the kingdom of God, and we will then understand that in orderto obtain happiness and satisfy the immortal soulin a fulness of glory that man must abide a celes-tial law and be quickened by a portion of the ce-lestial Spirit of God; and we will also understand that to commit sin, break the law of God andblaspheme his name, will bring sorrow and miseryand it will bring death both temporally and spirit-ually. If we walk in the paths of unrighteousness,we grieve the Holy Spirit and grieve our brethrenand injure ourselves.192 - 193Again, I wish to say a few words upon theblessings to be obtained by what we do, the laborswe perform, the work we are called upon to do in paying our tithing, in building temples, and in doing those things that are required of us. These are things that are for our own benefit and good,these, with other subjects have been impressed upon my mind for some weeks past, and it does appear to me that the people have not understoodthese things in their proper light.Some of the people have looked upon the law of tithing as a kind of tax and burthen laid upon them, but who is it for? Our tithing, our labor, and all that we do in the kingdom of God, who isit all for? The tithing is not to exalt the Lord, orfeed or clothe him, he has had his endowmentslong ago; it is thousands and millions of years since he received his blessings, and if he had notreceived them, we could not give them to him, forhe is far in advance of us. I want the brethrento understand this one thing, that our tithing, ourlabour, our works are not for the exaltation of the Almighty, but they are for us. Not but what the Lord is pleased to see us obey his command-ments, because by doing this it will place us in aposition that will fulfil and accomplish the objectof our creation, and bring about the end designedby our coming to take tabernacles here in theflesh. Again, when we do wrong the Lord knowswe shall inherit sorrow and misery if we con-tinue in that wrong. Then I say, brethren, let us understand this as it is and we shall do well. In paying our tithing, in obeying every law thatis given to exalt us and to do us good, it is all forour individual benefit and the benefit of our chil-dren, and it is not of any particular benefit to the Lord, only as he is pleased in the faithfulness ofhis children and desires to see them walk in the path which leads to salvation and eternal life.If we look upon things in this light we shall doevery thing cheerfully, and whatever calls are made upon us we shall gladly respond, and thenthe channels will be opened, there will be no ob-struction in the edification of the body of Christ,and light and intelligence will flowfrom the fountainhead unto the people, then when a man speaksthe people will, by their prayers and faith, draw forth the word of the Lord from him, and they will have their minds upon the things of God andnot upon everything else as it has been heretofore.If this people would rise up and do their dutywhen men rise before them in this stand to pointout the way of life, the Spirit of the Lord wouldreveal the things necessary for the people to un-derstand, for the faith of the people would drawthem out. All that is required is for the people to arouse themselves and get the light of Godwithin them.Brethren, I do not feel to speak much longer;I have done what I was required to do -- to occu-py a few moments in opening the meeting this morning, and there are two of the Presidency herewho will speak to the people and we wish to hear from them. I will say let us awake to righteous-ness, and in doing this we will see that there is notime to go to sleep; this we shall all know when we come to the end of the race, if not before. Weare now in our alphabet, we are yet engaged indoing our first works, and there are many lessons and principles which we have yet to learn beforewe get to those who are gone far in the advance of us and received their reward with the just, andtherefore I say there is no time to be lost. Let us make the best use of our time, and in doing so I pray that our minds may be enlightened, that wemay live our religion, that we may grow in graceand in the knowledge of God from this time forth, that we may improve the talents we havereceived, and that we may be satisfied at the endof the race, which may God grant for Christ'ssake: Amen.

 DISCOURSE BYElder WILFORD WOODRUFF,Delivered in the New Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday After-noon, August 13th, 1876.REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.In connection with the young brother, Elder Joseph H. Parry, whohas just returned from a preachingmission to England, I wish to bear my testimony and to make a fewremarks on the Scripture containedin the last chapter of St. Mark,commencing at the ##Mark 16:14-18|14th verse##, wherein an account is given of the Saviour's appearing unto the elevendisciples and of his upbraidingthem for their unbelief and hard-ness of heart, because they believednot them that had seen him after he was risen, etc. At this timethe following commission he gaveunto them—"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And thesesigns shall follow them that believein my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with newtongues; they shall take up ser-pents; and if they drink any deadlything, it shall not hurt them; and they shall lay hands on the sickand they shall recover."It may appear singular to somewhy our Elders do not treat on what is termed "the mysteries of the kingdom." I know of no great-er mystery to the inhabitants of the earth than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And yet the gospel is so plain, and so easy to be understoodthat the unlearned and the youthcan know of it. The Apostle Paulsaid, "For I am not ashamed of thegospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every onethat believeth." [##Romans 1:16##] He considered it of so much importance that on another occasion in writing to the Galatians, he said "But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that we have preached unto you,let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] From thefact of the Gospel being so simple, of its being adapted to the condi-tion and circumstances of all peo-ple, and of its having gone forth bycommandment of the Saviour to all the world, in the event of its being rejected condemnation must neces-sarily follow.Notwithstanding the simplicityof the gospel, where during the lasteighteen hundred years has been the man or the sect that has pre-sented it to the world as taught bythe Saviour and his apostles, before it was revealed from heaven, in ful-fillment of ancient prophecies, tothe young man Joseph Smith, and preached by him? No voice had ever been heard to proclaim it. There had never been a church oran organization upon the earth, since the days of Christ and his apostles, directed by the revelations of heaven and owned of God.The gospel now being preachedto all the world by commandmentof the Lord to the Prophet Josephis the same as taught by Adam, Enoch and the Saviour. It neverchanges through lapse of time; its ordinances and laws are always thesame, worlds without end.  The first principles of the Gospel taughtfrom the dawn of creation are faith,repentance and baptism, and thelaying on of hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost; and they are the same to-day. To certain minds there might be a mystery connect-ed with these principles. Why, say some, is this so? We can only answer, because it is the law of thegreat Jehovah, the plan framed in the heavens for the salvation and redemption of man. They are re-quirements made of the whole hu-man family, which must be obeyed in order that the prevailing mystery may be banished and the fruits and the blessings of the gospel enjoyed.The gospel is free to all; it is with-out money and without price. But none can officiate in its ordinancesacceptably to God, except thosewho have received divine authorityto do so. For, says the apostle, no man taketh this honor unto him-self, except he be called of God aswas Aaron. [##Hebrews 5:4##] But there are a great many gospels, all claiming to be of Christ, and all differing more or less from one another, and from the one taught by the Saviour whenupon the earth. When he who hasthe authority preaches the Gospelhe promises, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all that believe and obey,that the Holy Ghost will be giventhem. By virtue of this promiseall such can know for themselveswhether it is of God or whether it is of man. If an unauthorized mangoes forth, pretending to proclaim this same gospel, and it matters not how able and talented he may be, his doctrine can be detected, be-cause the promises which were tofollow the believers in Christ arenot realized, the Holy Ghost which imparts its gifts unto men are not received, and hence the fallacy of the doctrines of men is exposed, sothat none need be deceived.  Our boys are often called from the plowand the workshop to go abroad to the nations to disseminate the prin-ciples of the everlasting Gospel. By what power are our young men sus-tained, who go forth, inexpe-rienced, without much education, presenting in meekness to a learned and intelligent world the gospel of Christ? God through his angelsattends them; he strengthens their feeble knees, and gives them utter-ance.I was once preaching to a largeassembly in Collinsville, Connecti-cut; when I got through a young clergyman came forward and askedme if I had received my diplomafrom college. I answered him, "No." "Do you know," said he,"that a man who has not received a college diploma, has no right topreach?" "No, sir," I said, "I donot know it." "Well, sir," he said, "that is the case." I then asked him to inform me how it was thatJesus preached without receiving acollege diploma? and if such things as college diplomas were ever known or read of in the ministry of Christ and his Apostles?The Lord chose poor, illiteratefishermen and sent them forth tocombat and even to confound the wisdom of the wise. His gospel isrepresented to-day by the weakthings of the earth, and has been new for over forty years. And what is the result of our preaching? Let facts speak for themselves. You can behold for yourselves, a people gathered here from the different nations, all prompted by the same motives,namely, to build up and establish Zion on the earth in fulfillment of the words of God through the mouths of his prophets. Why havewe been so successful, thus far, inaccomplishing so great a work?Simply, because God has confirmed our preaching and the testimonies we have borne by conferring theHoly Ghost, with signs following the believers. Had not this beenthe case Utah would be to-day what it was on the 24th of July, 1847, when the pioneers first set foot onits soil—a barren, desolate land,unfit for the habitation of man. The results of our preaching be-spoke the fulfillment of prophecy. Zion has arisen, and some of theprophecies concerning her, recorded in the Old and New Testament, arehaving their fulfillment.Angels have visited the earth and delivered the keys of salvation tothe prophet Joseph. He lived long enough to effect a complete organ-ization of the church, strictly ac-cording to the revelations of God to him. God has in our day givengifts to men, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the min-istry, for the edifying of the bodyof Christ. The apostle likened thechurch unto a perfect body. Onepart cannot say to the other, I haveno need of you; but all the parts are necessary to complete the or-ganization; which is just as neces-sary to effect the perfection of theSaints of this generation as of any other.  Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance and baptism forthe remission of sin, are absoluterequirements, which must be com-plied with before the Holy Ghostcan be received. These signs, says the apostle, shall follow them that believe: in my name shall they cast out devils, they shall lay hands onthe sick and they shall recover, etc. These blessings are the rightof every honest believer in Christ.They were set in the church by the Saviour, and remain with theChurch, as a mighty cloud of wit-nesses throughout this Territorycould testify to; and not only theyof this Territory, but those of everyland and clime wherever the gospelhas been preached and a branch of the church organized.  Says theapostle John, This gospel is to bepreached to all that dwell on theearth, to every nation, and kin-dred, and tongue, and people; as a witness before the second comingof our Saviour to dwell on the earth, who will come, not as a lamb to the slaughter, not riding upon acolt, the object of the people'sscorn. [##Revelation 14:6##] But he will come in powerand great glory, taking vengeance upon them that love and fear himnot. We, therefore, are sendingglad tidings of great joy to whom-soever will receive them, that theymay come up to Zion and escape the judgments that will most assur-edly overtake the wicked.I know that we are engaged in thegreat latter-day work, the work of the living God. And I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, chosen and set apart to usher in this last dispensation of the ful-ness of times. He has left a record,published, sealed by his own blood,confirming the truth of the same. This testimony is in force to all the world, and it will be in forceuntil the end of time. This wedeclare is the kingdom which theProphet Daniel saw in vision,never more to be thrown down orgive to another people. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] In thesemountains Zion is to be built up,in fulfilment of prophecy, andevery jot and tittle that has been spoken of her must come to pass. The last is first, and the first will belast. [##Matthew 20:16##]  The Gospel was first sent directly to the Jews; the Saviour himself was of that lineage,through the loins of David. He came to his own, but they receivedhim not. [##John 1:11##] He was reproached of them, from the day of his birth un-til they crucified him on the cross.Consequently, the risen Redeemercommanded his Apostles to turn tothe Gentiles. They received the work and enjoyed the gifts and blessings of the Gospel, even theComforter, the Holy Ghost; and the Priesthood continued with them until a portion of them be-came unworthy of it, through their falling away, while the faithful were harassed and persecuted to their death. The Gospel is now restored to us Gentiles, for we are all Gentiles in a national capacity, and it will continue with us if we are faithful, until the law is boundand the testimony sealed and the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled, when it will again revert to the Jews, whom the Lord will have prepared to receive it. They willgather to their own land, takingwith them their gold and silver, and will re-build their city and temple, according to the predictionof Moses and the Prophets. Whenthis time arrives, which is nigh, even at our doors, let the Gentile na-tions who reject the Gospel whichis now sent to them, prepare to meet the judgments of an offended God! [##Matthew 24:33##] For when their cup is fulleven to the brim, the Lord will then remember the chastisement of the Jews, his favored people, and at whose hands they will havereceived double for their iniquities.Offences must come, said theSaviour, but woe unto them by whom they come. Woe unto the Gentiles, who have administeredafflictions to the Jews for these many years! Woe unto them if they now reject this only means ofsalvation, for the awful calamities spoken of in these books, the Bible and Book of Mormon, will certain-ly befall them.The principle of gathering has been preached for the past thirty-seven years. Before this principlewas preached by the Elders, a greatmany of the people had receivedthe spirit of it; and the consequencewas, that no sooner had it beentaught by the Presidency of the church, than the people everywhere were re[a]dy to receive it. It hadbeen revealed to them by the HolyGhost, whose office it is to reveal thatwhich is past, present, and that which is to come, and no surer, stronger testimony can be given toany one than it affords. We have gathered here for the express pur-pose of establishing Zion, which, according to the Scriptures, must be before the Gospel can be sent to the Jews. Passage after passage might be found in the Bible, referring to our coming here; the casting up of the highway on which the ransomed of the Lord might travel; the building of our city in a low place, which was to be called Sought out, a citynot forsaken; and how the Lord would cause springs of water to spring up, and the desert to blossom like the rose, etc., all of which havehad their fulfilment. But how dothe inhabitants of the earth regardthese things? With great indiffer-ence. In fact it would be a marvelto me were it otherwise, for accord-ing to the predictions, the peoplein this age were to be like unto thepeople of the days of Noah and Lot,marrying an giving in marriage, practising all manner of wicked-ness and abominations, and whollyunprepared for the coming of theSon of Man. The Jews were underno condemnation for rejecting the Savior, until he appeared amongstthem as the light of the world, then they had no longer a cloak for their sins;and in rejecting him, and those who were sent unto them, they stood condemned before the Lord, and,consequently, his threatened judg-ments overtook them. The peoplewho heard not the Gospel preached from the days of the apostles until its restoration in our day, are underno condemnation for rejecting the Gospel during the time it had been taken from the earth. But the light again has dawned upon the world, and the Elders of Israel are engaged proclaiming it far and wide, and as it was with the Jewsso it will be with the Gentiles who reject it, for the predictions of God'sProphets must have their fulfil-ment, and neither you nor I can prevent it if we would. We are charged with being uncharitablebecause we proclaim these things. We are not to blame, we are mere-ly the creatures used by the Al-mighty in doing his bidding. Thework is his, the plan of salvation isthe creation of his superior wisdom, not ours.Let me say to my brethren andsisters, our responsibilities are great,far greater than the outside world who reject the Gospel. We havereceived the light, the knowledgeof God; we are under sacred cove-nants to stand by the truth, and by one another in righteousness. If we are found traitors to the cause,crucifying the Son of Man afresh, great will be our condem-nation. Our time allotted us to tarry here below is short; but ourspirits are eternal, and will live forever, and our future destiny de-pends on this our earthly career. The Lord has given his angelscharge concerning us; they are our friends, and their eyes are over us.They stand in waiting with sharpsickles in their hands, ready to goforth and reap down the earth. Our calling is to perfect ourselves,to purify Zion and make it a fithabitation for the Son of God whenhe comes; to build Temples, and inthem perform the rites and ordi-nances for the living and the dead,and accomplish all that God de-signs us to do. And that we may befaithful in the performance thereofis my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 
 DISCOURSEBy Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, Taber-nacle, Sunday, a.m, April 22, 1860.REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.I always feel much pleasure in addressing a congregation of the Saints when I am inspir-ed by the Holy Ghost, for then I can be of benefit to those who hear.I realize that, until the priesthood was res-tored to the earth, we had no way of knowing the truth in relation to the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is true there were a great many anxiously seeking to know the Lord, but there were nonethat were able to give them the comfort andconsolation they desired.If a person goes without food for twenty-four hours, we all know that that individualwill become very hungry; and it is preciselyso with those who hunger for the principles of eternal life. While we enjoy the Spirit of theLord, we shall find that there is enough and an abundance to feed every human soul.I have never seen the day nor the hour thatI was not susceptible of being taught by my brethren, neither have I ever seen the timethat I thought I knew all the principles of the gospel, and I can truly say that I feel as muchedified to-day in contemplating the things of God as ever I did in any hour of my life. Weare all dependent upon the Lord, upon his holySpirit, and upon the testimony of the Lord Je-sus Christ for instruction, for light, and knowl-edge, such as is calculated to edify, encourage, sustain and aid us in magnifying our callingsin this life.We need not enter particularly into thegreat mysteries of the kingdom of God in or-der to be edified. A man may preach uponthe first principles of the gospel, and he willfind enough in them to instruct the people andedify himself in the things of God. Those principles are plain, they can easily be com-prehended when presented to the children of men as they are revealed from heaven.—But, as plain and simple as they are, for eighteen hundred years, the world was almost destitute of a knowledge of the truth, and ofthe Holy Ghost which is poured out to lead mankind in the way of truth. From the time of the great falling away, which took place inthe early part of the Christian era, up to thepresent time, the world have been ignorant with regard to the first principles of the gos-pel of Jesus Christ. It is true that professed Christians have had the examples of the Proph-ets and Apostles from their childhood up, as laid down in the New Testament, and yet they have been far from the truth, and did not knowthe correct way of worshipping God. It has been a mystery to you and to me that we havenever been able to unravel, or to find out byour own wisdom, the true knowledge of God; but the very fact that generation after gener-ation have risen up and established systems and organizations, all professing to be accord-ing to the plan of salvation, and yet opposedone to another, until they have raised up scores of churches all differing on points ofdoctrine, proves that there has been something out of the way.We know that we have the gospel of Christthat has been revealed from heaven in thisgeneration, wherein is taught faith, repent-ance and baptism for the remission of sins,and that obedience to those doctrines willbring all things to our remembrance and there-by enable us the more perfectly to do the will of God while we dwell here in the flesh. Asthe scriptures have informed us—"There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Al-mighty giveth it understanding." [##Job 32:8##] I do notknow that I can explain to you the reasons for the great difference we see in mankind, rela-tive to the principles of truth, but it has been so in every age of the world, and when the gospel has been preached the honest in heartand meek of the earth have obeyed and been sustained by it and they have been enabled to pass through many scenes of trial and to en-dure the persecutions that wicked men havedevised to afflict the people of God.The faithful have always had a positiveknowledge that what they were doing wasright and acceptable to the Almighty, and that they have been sustained in passing throughscenes of trial by the gift and power of God. They have realized that it was better to sacri-fice their lives for His kingdom than to liveand enjoy the riches and honors of this worldfor a season. This principle sustained the ancient Saints in all their affliction; it sustain-ed them in the den of lions, and in the fieryfurnace, and although they frequently sealedtheir testimony with their blood, they were comforted and consoled in looking forward to the time when the earth would enjoy her Sab-baths, and the Saints enter into their rests.The Jews marveled and wondered at the Sa-vior, for they saw that he was filled with lightand truth. "They had eyes to see, but they saw not." [##Matthew 13:13-15##] The Savior laid before them theprinciples of truth, he came to them and un-dertook to convert them, but he wept overthem when he saw what would be the conse-quences of their hard heartedness, and howthe Jewish nation would be overthrown andthe people scattered among all nations, if theyrejected the doctrines he presented to them.—He informed them what would be the result of their disobedience, and told them that the judgments of God would fall heavily upon them. He portrayed to them the oppressionsand torturings with which they would be af-flicted, foretold the destruction of the templethat it would be thrown down, and that there would not be left one stone upon another.— The majority of them mocked his sayings, and finally succeeded in putting him to death, but yet all that he foretold the Jews has come topass. The predictions of Moses also, concern-ing that nation, have been literally fulfilled, and that too in such a plain, pointed and un-mistakable manner that it seems almost im-possible for a man to be a disbeliever in the dealings of God with the Jewish nation.Peter, James, John, Philip, Bartholomewand the apostles generally warned that people; but they spurned the servants of God and turn-ed unto their idols. The apostles were in-spired by the Spirit of God, they enjoyed thegifts of the Holy Ghost, but the great mass ofthe Jewish nation hardened their hearts and would not listen to the words of life. I might say the same in relation to the present gener-ation. The church of Christ is organized pre-cisely as it was in the days of the Apostles, and we are living in the day and age of the world when the righteous blood that has been shed upon the earth will be avenged on the disobedient because they reject that gospelwhich would save them, and enable them to assist in the great work of the redemption of the dead. The gospel has been again restored by the administration of an angel from heav-en, whom the revelator John saw in vision when on the isle of Patmos, and when describ-ing it he says: And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on theearth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him, for the hourof his judgment is come; and worship him thatmade heaven, and earth, and the sea, and thefountains of waters.—##Revelation 14:6-7|Revelations, 14th chap., verses 6–7.##Did you ever know the Lord to bring his judgments upon any nation, from the days of Adam in the garden of Eden until the present time, before he had warned them of their sins?No, the Lord has always warned the peoplebefore he has punished them for their wicked-ness. He warned Sodom and Gomorrah be-fore he sent destruction upon them, and he has done so in every age of the world. [##Genesis 18:20-33##] In this generation the Almighty has raised up a prophet who has organized the kingdom ofGod, and thousands of the Lords annointedhave been inspired by the same spirit to pro-claim the words of live to the people, and who cannot foresee the judgments of God thatawait this generation? After the testimonyof the servants of God, the judgments that have been spoken of will be poured out upon the wicked. Every man and woman who lives up to principles of the gospel can see by the same spirit; they can understand by thethings that are written in the scriptures, and by the revelations of God that have been im-parted unto us, and that are before the world, that these things are hanging over the nations.We have before us the example of the ante-deluvian world; they were hard hearted and unbelieving, and would not believe until it was too late. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did not believe that they would be surroundedwith those dire calamities that afterwards be-fell them.In looking at the judgments of the Almigh-ty that we have witnessed, and have been cal-led to pass through, we see plenty to arouse us, and cause us to be diligent in the dis-charge of our duties. The heavens are full of judgments that are ready to be poured outupon this generation, and the Lord has as many ways in punishing the wicked as heever had in any previous dispensation. We witness the power of God made manifest by day and by night, and we ought to realize thenecessity of being obedient to all the require-ments of heaven.The Elders of Israel have gone forth andborne a true and faithful testimony of thegospel of Jesus Christ, and they have been as-sisted by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost. Our Prophet and Elders have been filled with good desires for the people, and have gone abroad and tried to bring mankindto a knowledge of the truth. Our President has cast his mind abroad over the world, and in his meditations he has planned for the wel-fare of the human family, and yet the wicked have desired his life, and thousands have de-spised him because he has reproved them fortheir wickedness and advocated righteous principles, and called upon them to repent oftheir sins and be baptized according to the order of God.The Prophet Joseph was inspired to laythe foundation of the Church and kingdom of God; before that time the masses of mankindwere in darkness, the professors of religion were deceived in regard to God and the things of his kingdom. If the Lord had not sent forth his servant Joseph, the devil would never have wrought upon the hearts of the children of men, as he has done, but because the Proph-et was laying the foundation of that great work which the Lord had determined to per-form in the last days, the hearts of the chil-dren of men were stirred up to roar against the Lord's anointed. But the truth was bound to prevail, and for the accomplishment of thisobject the Prophet laboured day and night.I know that Joseph Smith was a good man, a Prophet, a Seer and a Revelator, and thathe sealed his testimony with his blood thatthe nation that was worthy might receive their reward. There is no principle revealed in this generation but those which are known by the Almighty to be for the salvation of hiscreatures. The spirit of warfare that is mani-fested in these days has existed in all ages when the priesthood was upon the earth. There was always a war between light and darkness, God and the devil, saint and sinner, correct principles and false doctrines. We our-selves have a warfare with the evil propensitiesof our nature; we have already had to meet a warfare outwardly; in some instances there hasbeen a physical contest, and our enemies have sought our destruction from the beginning. That warfare will continue until satan isbound and iniquity swept from the earth. We need not suppose that we shall have peace, for there will be no peace to the righteous until he reigns whose right it is to reign. It is in this generation precisely as one of theprophets foretold it should be; "surely ourfathers have inherited lies, vanity, and thingswherein there is no profit." [##Jeremiah 16:19##]Thousands and millions of the sectarian world are in this condition, and will be led to use this or similar language. The honest among them will get their reward, and it willbe far superior to any thing they have antici-pated. It is true they entertain many false doctrines, but let us remember that we believed false doctrines, and were surrounded with thetraditions of our fathers, before we heard thefullness of the gospel. When we heard its principles taught we admired and received them for the truth's sake, and rejoiced in theblessings that followed our obedience.We have now got a warfare to endure; we must war against every evil principle until wecan learn to do right in all things. This is the spirit we must learn to cultivate day byday; the knowledge we have of the gospel will assist us in doing this.There is one peculiar feature connected with the preaching of the gospel; you may send out a thousand Elders and they will all teach the same doctrines, they will all labor for the building up of the same church, they will beunited, for their faith, their doctrines, and the organization of the church have all been madeknown unto them by the revelations of God;hence they will see eye to eye in regard to the principles of the gospel. Supposing a thou-sand minsters of different denominations wereto be sent out into the world, it would be verydifferent with them, from what it is with theElders of the Church of Christ; they would not be so united, nor so harmonious in their sentiments. Our union and oneness of senti-ment constitutes one of the prominent beauties of the organization of the kingdom of God.There was never any other gospel taught to the old prophets, excepting that which is nowtaught to you and to this generation; neitherwas there ever any of the children of men saved upon any other principle than that which is now presented to the people. TheChurch of Christ always had in it prophets, apostles and patriarchs; it was always blest with the gifts of inspiration, power to heal the sick and to perform such miracles as were necessary for the salvation of the Saints.If you were to meet with Father Adam, with Seth, Moses, Aaron, Christ or the Apostles, they would all teach the same prin-ciples that we have been taught; they would not vary one particle. This gospel is everlast-ing in its nature, and unchangeable in its character. It might be urged that the house of Israel had the law of carnal command-ments, but that only acted as a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ, because they wouldnot receive a celestial law. They had the priesthood of Aaron for a series of years amongst them, but the old apostles, prophetsand saints were saved by the gospel and not by the law of carnal commandments.I want to say a word about our present po-sition. When we first received the gospel we professed to rejoice in its principles, and inthe blessings which followed our obedience,and should we not continue to rejoice and to be diligent in the work of the Lord; yea, even more so to-day than we did when wefirst received it? When a boy begins his edu-cation at school he begins at the first rudi-ments, and continues to progress step by step. It is so with the student in the study of the everlasting gospel. There were not many principles revealed to us when we first receiv-ed it, but they were developed to us as fast aswe were capable of making use of them.I well remember the first sermon I heard;my conviction was that I had learned moreabout God and the things of his kingdom thanI had learned in all my previous life. I be-lieved the gospel then, and I not only believe it now, but I know it to be true. Since then I have received much valuable instruction thro'the revelations of God that have been made manifest; and I have never yet heard a princi-ple set forth, but I have been able to seebeauty and glory connected with it.The subject of the vision that was given to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, was alluded to by brother Young and others during our conference. In reference to that I wish tosay, that when I first read that vision, it swept away a vail that had been around me all my life, it opened my understanding and shook off my shackles. There was some thing in it so different from the old sectarian, notion, some-thing that swept away the idea of one heaven, one hell, and that those who do not go to one place must go to the other; and that all in heaven have an equal glory, and all in hell an equal misery. There always appeared something very inconsistent connected with the doctrine of future rewards and punishments, as taught by modern divines; but when I got hold of the vision I saw more light, more consistency and Godlike mercy and justice, than I had ever seen in my life.I refer to these things to show how the vail was taken from my eyes, and how I was made to comprehend that every man is rewarded ac-cording to the deeds done in the body. I then saw there was something to encourage a manto be true and faithful, and to be filled with integrity, while on the other hand, it was made manifest that it would not pay a man to doevil. Every man gets the reward he earns by his labours. We can see this every day of our lives. You never saw a man who had par-taken of the blessings of the kingdom of God,and then turned against the Lord, and would do wickedly and blaspheme the name of the Deity, but what the Spirit God would with-draw from him and leave him miserable. The hand of God always overtakes such a one, evil lies in his path, and he is tormented by day and by night. We have seen this during our experience in this Church.To me the principle of integrity is one of the greatest blessings we can possibly possess. He who proves true to himself, to his breth-ren, to his friends, and his God, will have the evidence within him that he is accepted; he will have the confidence of his God and of his friends. It is a great and a glorious principle; it is something that gives you that assurance in your friends that you can trust your prop-erty, your life, your all in the hands of your brethren.The Lord has said, I will prove you in all things, even unto death. [##Doctrine and Covenants 98:14##] How truly this has been fulfilled in this church. Scores and hun-dreds of our brethren have laid down their lives in carrying out the principles of the gos-pel of Jesus Christ; they have been hastened away from this world by their enemies, but they have maintained their integrity, proven themselves to be true and faithful before the Lord, and their spirits now mingle with the spirits of the just.We should all seek to do right, try to per-form our duties day by day, to God and to each other, and put away everything that wars against the Spirit of the Lord.I rejoice every day I live in beholding the signs of the times, in looking at the progress of the Church and kingdom of God upon theearth. The Lord has guided and governed us all the day long. We have every reason to be thankful for his goodness unto us, and we may rest assured that his blessings will be poured out upon us just as fast as we are ca-pable of receiving and making a right use ofthem.The judgments that are coming upon the wicked will cause the ears of the children of men to tingle and their hearts to quake. Do you think they realize those things? No, they do not; they are all in the dark, but it is just as Elder Pratt said during our conference.—After the testimonies of the servants of God will come those of thunderings, earth-quakes, pestilence, famines and the sword.—The Lord also says by revelation, that when these judgments do come, when they are poured out upon the earth: "O ye nations ofthe earth, how oft have I called upon you by my servants, by the ministering of angels, and by my own voice and by famines, tempest,earthquakes and pestilence of every kind, and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye would not; behold the day has come when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation is full, and it shall be poured out upon the disobedient." [##Doctrine and Covenants 43:25-26##]Remember these things, for the words of the Lord must be fulfilled. When a man who believes the gospel reflects, he becomes satis-fied that not one of those sayings will be suf-fered to return unto the Lord void, but he re-alizes that they will accomplish that for which they were sent; but a man who knows not God cannot realize anything about the cal-amities that are to come upon the earth. You might preach to him as long as Noah preach-ed to the antediluvians; you might try till you were grey with old age, and you would try in vain to get him to understand the things of God.If we had correct understanding we should all see as the Lord does, and should under-stand how his purposes will be accomplished; but we are to walk by faith and not by sight.I feel to rejoice in knowing that the kingdom of God is established on the earth, and that it will spread itself abroad—become like a great mountain, and finally fill the earth. The words of the Lord will not return to him void; but whether he speaks by his own voice or the voice of his servants, those words will have their fulfilment.Let us be faithful, and adorn ourselves with the graces of the gospel. There is nothing gained by doing wrong. Lying, stealing, blaspheming, drunkenness, backbiting and denying the Lord Jesus Christ, bring sorrow and remorse; it debaces man who is organized in the image of God; but to do right, to obey the commandments of God, to be charitable and kind, brings joy and peace and the Holy Ghost, and an eventual exaltation in our Father's kingdom.May we all so live that we may be worthy to dwell in his presence in the world to come, and to participate in the fullness of that glory and blessedness promised to the faithful, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.

 lower & dangerous ferry can be Entirely abandoned.As it is there are the following objections to it1. It is so far away ^from the house on the ranch^ that the traveler hasto wait—often for hours—until his presenceis discovered.2. It is dangerous to cross on account ofits close proximity to the mouth of MarbleCanyon with its rapids.3. At high water time when the water flowsswiftly it is altogether an impracticable crossing.The upper crossing would be much the better,but the horrible terrors of the steep, rocky anddangerous road over to it from the lower fordrender it a frightful barrier. I personally knowof several families who have gone around byrail rather than risk the possibility of having to go over that dangerous road.Hence the Ferry as it now is, is neitherattractive to travelers, convenient or safe.Now may I suggest the following foryour Earnest consideration.

 Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCYONEIDA STAKE OF ZIONPreston, Idaho June 15, 1897Prest. Wilford Woodruff and Counselors.Dear Brethren:A few days ago elder D. A. Damont, of this place,called in to see me about his mission to the Southern Statesto which he has been recently called.He represents that since writing to you, he hasconsidered his circumstances more carefully and desiresto make the following representation:He is owing for ^a^ new wagon and an interest ina saw mill to the amount of 30000 and besides thathis home, which he values at $150000, is now undermortgage for $40000 which mortgage falls due in aboutone year from date. His crop of grain this season willnot clear off these accounts, and while his creditorsare willing to wait and he is willing to go now if it isthought best that he should I believe it would be better toallow him to stay at home for one year, in which timehe thinks, and it appears reasonable to me, that he canpay off his obligations and leave his family in a moresatisfactory condition.After furnishing you with this information Bro. Damontis perfectly willing to leave the matter to your wisdome and willcheerfully abide your decission. Your Brother Geo. C. ParkinsonLet him have a year with ourblessing & prayers for success. J. F.
