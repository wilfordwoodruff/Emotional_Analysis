 REMARKS  By Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Sun-  day, January 25, 1857.    [REPORTED BY J. B. LONG.]    I am requested to get up and address you a   short time. I do not know that I will be able to  make this large assembly of people hear me this  morning, but I will do the best I can to accom-  plish it. I feel that it is a very good sign to see  so many people out to meeting, it seems as though  they felt interested in meeting together to receive  instructions; to see as crowded a house as this is  this morning, is a proof that there is an increasing  interest resting upon the people to hear the word of  the Lord and receive instructions from the servants  of God, and I do hope, brethren and sisters, that  what instructions you do receive, you will prize,  lay it up, and practise it, whether it be much  or little.    I realize that the salvation of this people does  not depend upon the great amount of teaching,   instruction, or revelation that is given unto them,  but their salvation depends more upon their obey-  ing the commandments of God which are given  unto them, their becoming a doer of the word, and  following the counsel of those who are set to  lead them. We certainly have a great amount of  teaching, of instruction, of principle, of revela-  tion, and of the word of God, which has been  given unto this people; not only that which is re-  corded in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, Book  of Doctrine and Covenants, the Church History,  but we have day by day, and night by night, in-  structions given unto us, we have a little here and  a little there, a discourse to-day and another to-  night, and we are continually receiving instruc-  tions from the servants of God. We receive in-  structions in our Ward meetings, and almost every  time a few of us meet together, we do so for the  purpose of receiving the word of the Lord.    It appears to me then that we are certainly  a favoured people, and that we are having a great  deal of important instruction, such as is calcu-  lated to lead us unto salvation. Inasmuch then  as we have been called upon to reform, or to ad-  vance and to grow in the principles of eternal life,  and to become holy in our lives, I hope there is  none of us but that will take hold with our whole  soul and carry out the instruction, and try to  practise it in word and deed. We frequently hear  remarks made about the reformation being over,  and about their having got through with it in this  place or in that place, but the amount of it is  there never will be any end to the reformation, or  in other words, there will never be any end to our  advancement, there will be no end to our improve-  ment nor to our increase, neither in time nor in all  eternity.    If we act up to our privileges as a people, we  have no more time to lose or to spend in an un-  profitable manner. We should not act indifferently  with regard to the blessings which the Lord is  offering unto us, and which we have the privilege  of obtaining; we should labour with all our might  to build up the kingdom of God, that we may se-  cure unto ourselves every blessing necessary for  our salvation. We live in an important day; it is  a day of mercy and a day of great blessings unto  us as a people, and we should appreciate it as  such.    I have reflected a good deal within the last few  months, and especially while sitting and listening  to the teachings of the First Presidency, the  Twelve, and the Elders of Israel in their various  spheres and callings in which they are called to  act. In my prayers and reflections I have thought  much of our present position, and I have con-  cluded that if we do not enjoy the Holy Spirit, and  if the vision of our mind is not open to compre-  hend the things of God, and the power which is  being made manifest for our benefit and good, that  we are in great danger of suffering loss; we should  see more fully theimportance of taking hold with  our might, and then, as br. Kimball says, the Holy  Spirit of God would be diffused through our whole  bodies and through the whole body and Church  of Christ.    I feel and see the importance of this work, and  I see the necessity of our walking up to the line  of our duty, that we may live and walk daily in  the light of the Lord. I realize that the Presi-  dency of this church stand between this people  and the Lord, for they are the head, and I realize  that God reveals to them His will, and therefore  we should look unto them for light and for infor-  mation. The head may be full of light, of inspir-  ation, revelation and of the mind and will of God,  but if those officers who stand next to them, and  if we ourselves are asleep in relation to our duties,  and are not in a fit state to receive that light, do  you not see that the river is dammed up at the  head? There is no current or medium whereby  the light may flow to the limbs and branches of the body.    I realize that it is the duty, not only of us who  hold the Priesthood but of this people generally,  to present ourselves in humility and faith before  the Lord, that we may obtain the blessings which  are in readiness for us, and we can obtain all the  light, the knowledge, the faith, the intelligence  and power which is necessary for our salvation by  humility, obedience and submission to the will of  God. We should attend to this in order that our  minds may be prepared and our bodies become fit  subjects for the reception of the Holy Ghost, so  that the Spirit of God may flow freely through the  whole body from the head to the foot. Then when  this is the case we will all see alike, feel alike,  and be alike, and become one as far as the Gospel  and kingdom of God is concerned, as the Father  and Son are one, and then this people will begin  to see the position and relationship which we  bear towards each other and towards God, and we  shall feel the importance of attending to our du-  ties and we will willingly step forward and im-  prove our time, make good use of our talents and  obtain the blessings that the Lord has for us to  enjoy; but do you not see that if the people are  asleep and slothful and not living up to their priv-  ileges, and the Spirit of God begins to flow from  the head to the body that it soon becomes ob-  structed and dammed up?    We may trace this principle through the Church  and kingdom of God, and you may carry it into  the family government, and you will find it as  br. Kimball has already presented it to us. It is  like the vine with its limbs, its branches and  its twigs. This is a very good figure to teach us the  principle of righteousness.    In order for us to be prepared to do the will of  God and be in a position to build up his kingdom  upon the earth, and to carry out his purposes, we  must not only become united and act as the heart  of one man, but we must obtain the Holy Spirit  of God and the mind and will of God concerning  us, and be governed and controlled by it in all of  our movements and acts in order to be safe and  to secure unto ourselves salvation.    If I do not enjoy the Holy Spirit, there is some-  thing the matter, and I should labour until that is  removed, for I consider that to be the first turn-  ing key, and we should do this to prove that we  are honest before the Lord, and that we desire to  do right in our minds and in our hearts. Yet  as I have said before unless that Spirit is with us  we do not know whether we are doing right  or wrong.    [Prest. Kimball: Shut that door and let it re-  main so, for I tell you there is no one can enjoy  the peaceful influence of the Holy Spirit where  there is confusion; and I am sure this congrega-  tion cannot while that door is going clickitty-  clack.]-    As I was remarking, unless we do obtain the  Holy Spirit we are in danger every step we take,  we are not safe neither are we in a con-  dition to build up the kingdom of God or do His  work. I consider that the Lord requires this at  the hand of every man and woman in Israel, every  Latter Day Saint, that we first obtain the Holy  Spirit then bring forth the fruits of it unto salva-  tion, then you will see this people keep their  covenants and obey the commandments of God;  this is the duty of all of us, and we should live  our religion and follow its dictates. When this is  done, you will see this people awake and bring  forth works of righteousness, then they will have  faith and they will have power, and rise up and  the power and glory of God will be made mani-  fest through such instruments as the Lord has  chosen in this dispensation upon the earth, into  whose hands He has committed the Holy Priest-  hood.    Ask any people, nations, kingdoms or genera-  tions of men the question and they will tell you  they are seeking for happiness, but how are  they seeking for it? Take the greatest portion  of mankind as an ensample and how are they  seeking for happiness? By serving the devil as  fast as they can, and almost the last Being or   thing that the children of men worship, and the  last Being whose laws they want to keep are the  laws of the God of heaven. They will not wor-  ship God nor honour his name, nor keep his laws,  but blaspheme his name from day to day, and  nearly all the world are seeking for happiness by  committing sins, breaking the law of God and  blaspheming his name and rejecting the only  source whence happiness flows.    If we really understood that we could not ob-  tain happiness by walking in the paths of sin and  breaking the laws of God, we should then see the  folly of it, every man and every woman would  see that to obtain happiness we should go to work  and perform the works of righteousness, and do  the will of our Father in heaven, for we shall re-  ceive at his hand all the happiness, blessing, glory,   salvation, exaltation and eternal lives that we ever  do receive either in time or eternity.    We should understand that we should not de-  ceive ourselves in this matter, for if we deceive   ourselves we shall suffer the loss. We may just   as well search our own hearts, and at once re-  solve that we will do the works of righteousness,  honor our Father in heaven, do our duty to God   and man, take hold and build up the kingdom of   God, and we will then understand that in order  to obtain happiness and satisfy the immortal soul  in a fulness of glory that man must abide a celes-  tial law and be quickened by a portion of the ce-  lestial Spirit of God; and we will also understand   that to commit sin, break the law of God and  blaspheme his name, will bring sorrow and misery  and it will bring death both temporally and spirit-  ually. If we walk in the paths of unrighteousness,  we grieve the Holy Spirit and grieve our brethren  and injure ourselves.    192 - 193Again, I wish to say a few words upon the  blessings to be obtained by what we do, the labors  we perform, the work we are called upon to do   in paying our tithing, in building temples, and in   doing those things that are required of us. These   are things that are for our own benefit and good,  these, with other subjects have been impressed   upon my mind for some weeks past, and it does   appear to me that the people have not understood  these things in their proper light.    Some of the people have looked upon the law   of tithing as a kind of tax and burthen laid upon   them, but who is it for? Our tithing, our labor,   and all that we do in the kingdom of God, who is  it all for? The tithing is not to exalt the Lord, or  feed or clothe him, he has had his endowments  long ago; it is thousands and millions of years   since he received his blessings, and if he had not  received them, we could not give them to him, for  he is far in advance of us. I want the brethren  to understand this one thing, that our tithing, our  labour, our works are not for the exaltation of the   Almighty, but they are for us. Not but what   the Lord is pleased to see us obey his command-  ments, because by doing this it will place us in a  position that will fulfil and accomplish the object  of our creation, and bring about the end designed  by our coming to take tabernacles here in the  flesh. Again, when we do wrong the Lord knows  we shall inherit sorrow and misery if we con-  tinue in that wrong. Then I say, brethren, let   us understand this as it is and we shall do well.   In paying our tithing, in obeying every law that  is given to exalt us and to do us good, it is all for  our individual benefit and the benefit of our chil-  dren, and it is not of any particular benefit to the   Lord, only as he is pleased in the faithfulness of  his children and desires to see them walk in the   path which leads to salvation and eternal life.    If we look upon things in this light we shall do  every thing cheerfully, and whatever calls are   made upon us we shall gladly respond, and then  the channels will be opened, there will be no ob-  struction in the edification of the body of Christ,  and light and intelligence will flowfrom the fountain  head unto the people, then when a man speaks  the people will, by their prayers and faith, draw   forth the word of the Lord from him, and they   will have their minds upon the things of God and  not upon everything else as it has been heretofore.    If this people would rise up and do their duty  when men rise before them in this stand to point  out the way of life, the Spirit of the Lord would  reveal the things necessary for the people to un-  derstand, for the faith of the people would draw  them out. All that is required is for the people   to arouse themselves and get the light of God  within them.    Brethren, I do not feel to speak much longer;  I have done what I was required to do -- to occu-  py a few moments in opening the meeting this   morning, and there are two of the Presidency here  who will speak to the people and we wish to hear   from them. I will say let us awake to righteous-  ness, and in doing this we will see that there is no  time to go to sleep; this we shall all know when   we come to the end of the race, if not before. We  are now in our alphabet, we are yet engaged in  doing our first works, and there are many lessons   and principles which we have yet to learn before  we get to those who are gone far in the advance   of us and received their reward with the just, and  therefore I say there is no time to be lost. Let us   make the best use of our time, and in doing so I   pray that our minds may be enlightened, that we  may live our religion, that we may grow in grace  and in the knowledge of God from this time   forth, that we may improve the talents we have  received, and that we may be satisfied at the end  of the race, which may God grant for Christ's  sake: Amen.

 DISCOURSE   BY  Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF,  Delivered in the New Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday After-  noon, August 13th, 1876.    REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.    In connection with the young   brother, Elder Joseph H. Parry, who  has just returned from a preaching  mission to England, I wish to bear   my testimony and to make a few  remarks on the Scripture contained  in the last chapter of St. Mark,  commencing at the ##Mark 16:14-18|14th verse##,   wherein an account is given of the   Saviour's appearing unto the eleven  disciples and of his upbraiding  them for their unbelief and hard-  ness of heart, because they believed  not them that had seen him after   he was risen, etc. At this time  the following commission he gave  unto them—    "Go ye into all the world and   preach the gospel to every creature.  He that believeth and is baptized   shall be saved; but he that believeth   not shall be damned. And these  signs shall follow them that believe  in my name shall they cast out   devils; they shall speak with new  tongues; they shall take up ser-  pents; and if they drink any deadly  thing, it shall not hurt them; and   they shall lay hands on the sick  and they shall recover."    It may appear singular to some  why our Elders do not treat on   what is termed "the mysteries of   the kingdom." I know of no great-  er mystery to the inhabitants of   the earth than the Gospel of Jesus   Christ. And yet the gospel is so   plain, and so easy to be understood  that the unlearned and the youth  can know of it. The Apostle Paul  said, "For I am not ashamed of the  gospel of Christ, for it is the power   of God unto salvation to every one  that believeth." [##Romans 1:16##] He considered it   of so much importance that on   another occasion in writing to the   Galatians, he said "But though we   or an angel from heaven preach   any other gospel unto you than   that we have preached unto you,  let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##] From the  fact of the Gospel being so simple,   of its being adapted to the condi-  tion and circumstances of all peo-  ple, and of its having gone forth by  commandment of the Saviour to all   the world, in the event of its being   rejected condemnation must neces-  sarily follow.    Notwithstanding the simplicity  of the gospel, where during the last  eighteen hundred years has been   the man or the sect that has pre-  sented it to the world as taught by  the Saviour and his apostles, before   it was revealed from heaven, in ful-  fillment of ancient prophecies, to  the young man Joseph Smith, and   preached by him? No voice had   ever been heard to proclaim it.   There had never been a church or  an organization upon the earth,   since the days of Christ and his   apostles, directed by the revelations   of heaven and owned of God.    The gospel now being preached  to all the world by commandment  of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph  is the same as taught by Adam,   Enoch and the Saviour. It never  changes through lapse of time; its   ordinances and laws are always the  same, worlds without end.  The   first principles of the Gospel taught  from the dawn of creation are faith,  repentance and baptism, and the  laying on of hands for the reception   of the Holy Ghost; and they are   the same to-day. To certain minds   there might be a mystery connect-  ed with these principles. Why,   say some, is this so? We can only   answer, because it is the law of the  great Jehovah, the plan framed in   the heavens for the salvation and   redemption of man. They are re-  quirements made of the whole hu-  man family, which must be obeyed   in order that the prevailing mystery   may be banished and the fruits and   the blessings of the gospel enjoyed.  The gospel is free to all; it is with-  out money and without price. But   none can officiate in its ordinances  acceptably to God, except those  who have received divine authority  to do so. For, says the apostle, no   man taketh this honor unto him-  self, except he be called of God as  was Aaron. [##Hebrews 5:4##] But there are a great   many gospels, all claiming to be of   Christ, and all differing more or   less from one another, and from the   one taught by the Saviour when  upon the earth. When he who has  the authority preaches the Gospel  he promises, in the name of Jesus   Christ, to all that believe and obey,  that the Holy Ghost will be given  them. By virtue of this promise  all such can know for themselves  whether it is of God or whether it   is of man. If an unauthorized man  goes forth, pretending to proclaim   this same gospel, and it matters not   how able and talented he may be,   his doctrine can be detected, be-  cause the promises which were to  follow the believers in Christ are  not realized, the Holy Ghost which   imparts its gifts unto men are not   received, and hence the fallacy of   the doctrines of men is exposed, so  that none need be deceived.  Our   boys are often called from the plow  and the workshop to go abroad to   the nations to disseminate the prin-  ciples of the everlasting Gospel. By   what power are our young men sus-  tained, who go forth, inexpe-  rienced, without much education,   presenting in meekness to a learned   and intelligent world the gospel of   Christ? God through his angels  attends them; he strengthens their   feeble knees, and gives them utter-  ance.    I was once preaching to a large  assembly in Collinsville, Connecti-  cut; when I got through a young   clergyman came forward and asked  me if I had received my diploma  from college. I answered him,   "No." "Do you know," said he,  "that a man who has not received   a college diploma, has no right to  preach?" "No, sir," I said, "I do  not know it." "Well, sir," he said,   "that is the case." I then asked   him to inform me how it was that  Jesus preached without receiving a  college diploma? and if such things   as college diplomas were ever   known or read of in the ministry of   Christ and his Apostles?    The Lord chose poor, illiterate  fishermen and sent them forth to  combat and even to confound the   wisdom of the wise. His gospel is  represented to-day by the weak  things of the earth, and has   been new for over forty years.   And what is the result of our   preaching? Let facts speak for   themselves. You can behold for   yourselves, a people gathered here   from the different nations, all   prompted by the same motives,  namely, to build up and establish   Zion on the earth in fulfillment of   the words of God through the   mouths of his prophets. Why have  we been so successful, thus far, in  accomplishing so great a work?  Simply, because God has confirmed   our preaching and the testimonies   we have borne by conferring the  Holy Ghost, with signs following   the believers. Had not this been  the case Utah would be to-day what   it was on the 24th of July, 1847,   when the pioneers first set foot on  its soil—a barren, desolate land,  unfit for the habitation of man.   The results of our preaching be-  spoke the fulfillment of prophecy.   Zion has arisen, and some of the  prophecies concerning her, recorded   in the Old and New Testament, are  having their fulfillment.    Angels have visited the earth and   delivered the keys of salvation to  the prophet Joseph. He lived long   enough to effect a complete organ-  ization of the church, strictly ac-  cording to the revelations of God to   him. God has in our day given  gifts to men, for the perfecting of   the Saints, for the work of the min-  istry, for the edifying of the body  of Christ. The apostle likened the  church unto a perfect body. One  part cannot say to the other, I have  no need of you; but all the parts   are necessary to complete the or-  ganization; which is just as neces-  sary to effect the perfection of the  Saints of this generation as of any   other.  Faith in the Lord Jesus   Christ, repentance and baptism for  the remission of sin, are absolute  requirements, which must be com-  plied with before the Holy Ghost  can be received. These signs, says   the apostle, shall follow them that   believe: in my name shall they cast   out devils, they shall lay hands on  the sick and they shall recover,   etc. These blessings are the right  of every honest believer in Christ.  They were set in the church by   the Saviour, and remain with the  Church, as a mighty cloud of wit-  nesses throughout this Territory  could testify to; and not only they  of this Territory, but those of every  land and clime wherever the gospel  has been preached and a branch of   the church organized.  Says the  apostle John, This gospel is to be  preached to all that dwell on the  earth, to every nation, and kin-  dred, and tongue, and people; as a   witness before the second coming  of our Saviour to dwell on the earth,   who will come, not as a lamb to   the slaughter, not riding upon a    colt, the object of the people's  scorn. [##Revelation 14:6##] But he will come in power  and great glory, taking vengeance   upon them that love and fear him  not. We, therefore, are sending  glad tidings of great joy to whom-  soever will receive them, that they  may come up to Zion and escape   the judgments that will most assur-  edly overtake the wicked.    I know that we are engaged in the  great latter-day work, the work of   the living God. And I know that   Joseph Smith was a Prophet of   God, chosen and set apart to usher   in this last dispensation of the ful-  ness of times. He has left a record,  published, sealed by his own blood,  confirming the truth of the same.   This testimony is in force to all   the world, and it will be in force  until the end of time. This we  declare is the kingdom which the  Prophet Daniel saw in vision,  never more to be thrown down or  give to another people. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] In these  mountains Zion is to be built up,  in fulfilment of prophecy, and  every jot and tittle that has been   spoken of her must come to pass.   The last is first, and the first will be  last. [##Matthew 20:16##]  The Gospel was first sent   directly to the Jews; the Saviour   himself was of that lineage,  through the loins of David. He   came to his own, but they received  him not. [##John 1:11##] He was reproached of   them, from the day of his birth un-  til they crucified him on the cross.  Consequently, the risen Redeemer  commanded his Apostles to turn to  the Gentiles. They received the   work and enjoyed the gifts and   blessings of the Gospel, even the  Comforter, the Holy Ghost; and   the Priesthood continued with   them until a portion of them be-  came unworthy of it, through their   falling away, while the faithful   were harassed and persecuted to   their death. The Gospel is now   restored to us Gentiles, for we are   all Gentiles in a national capacity,   and it will continue with us if we   are faithful, until the law is bound  and the testimony sealed and the   times of the Gentiles are fulfilled,   when it will again revert to the   Jews, whom the Lord will have   prepared to receive it. They will  gather to their own land, taking  with them their gold and silver,   and will re-build their city and   temple, according to the prediction  of Moses and the Prophets. When  this time arrives, which is nigh,   even at our doors, let the Gentile na-  tions who reject the Gospel which  is now sent to them, prepare to   meet the judgments of an offended   God! [##Matthew 24:33##] For when their cup is full  even to the brim, the Lord will   then remember the chastisement   of the Jews, his favored people,   and at whose hands they will have  received double for their iniquities.  Offences must come, said the  Saviour, but woe unto them by   whom they come. Woe unto the   Gentiles, who have administered  afflictions to the Jews for these   many years! Woe unto them if   they now reject this only means of  salvation, for the awful calamities   spoken of in these books, the Bible   and Book of Mormon, will certain-  ly befall them.    The principle of gathering has   been preached for the past thirty-  seven years. Before this principle  was preached by the Elders, a great  many of the people had received  the spirit of it; and the consequence  was, that no sooner had it been  taught by the Presidency of the   church, than the people everywhere   were re[a]dy to receive it. It had  been revealed to them by the Holy  Ghost, whose office it is to reveal that  which is past, present, and that   which is to come, and no surer,   stronger testimony can be given to  any one than it affords. We have   gathered here for the express pur-  pose of establishing Zion, which,   according to the Scriptures, must   be before the Gospel can be   sent to the Jews. Passage   after passage might be found   in the Bible, referring to our   coming here; the casting up of the   highway on which the ransomed of   the Lord might travel; the building   of our city in a low place, which   was to be called Sought out, a city  not forsaken; and how the Lord   would cause springs of water to   spring up, and the desert to blossom   like the rose, etc., all of which have  had their fulfilment. But how do  the inhabitants of the earth regard  these things? With great indiffer-  ence. In fact it would be a marvel  to me were it otherwise, for accord-  ing to the predictions, the people  in this age were to be like unto the  people of the days of Noah and Lot,  marrying an giving in marriage,   practising all manner of wicked-  ness and abominations, and wholly  unprepared for the coming of the  Son of Man. The Jews were under  no condemnation for rejecting the   Savior, until he appeared amongst  them as the light of the   world, then they had no   longer a cloak for their sins;  and in rejecting him, and those who   were sent unto them, they stood   condemned before the Lord, and,  consequently, his threatened judg-  ments overtook them. The people  who heard not the Gospel preached   from the days of the apostles until   its restoration in our day, are under  no condemnation for rejecting the   Gospel during the time it had been   taken from the earth. But the   light again has dawned upon the   world, and the Elders of Israel are   engaged proclaiming it far and   wide, and as it was with the Jews  so it will be with the Gentiles who   reject it, for the predictions of God's  Prophets must have their fulfil-  ment, and neither you nor I can   prevent it if we would. We are   charged with being uncharitable  because we proclaim these things.   We are not to blame, we are mere-  ly the creatures used by the Al-  mighty in doing his bidding. The  work is his, the plan of salvation is  the creation of his superior wisdom,   not ours.    Let me say to my brethren and  sisters, our responsibilities are great,  far greater than the outside world   who reject the Gospel. We have  received the light, the knowledge  of God; we are under sacred cove-  nants to stand by the truth, and by   one another in righteousness. If   we are found traitors to the cause,  crucifying the Son of Man   afresh, great will be our condem-  nation. Our time allotted us to   tarry here below is short; but our  spirits are eternal, and will live for  ever, and our future destiny de-  pends on this our earthly career.   The Lord has given his angels  charge concerning us; they are our   friends, and their eyes are over us.  They stand in waiting with sharp  sickles in their hands, ready to go  forth and reap down the earth.   Our calling is to perfect ourselves,  to purify Zion and make it a fit  habitation for the Son of God when  he comes; to build Temples, and in  them perform the rites and ordi-  nances for the living and the dead,  and accomplish all that God de-  signs us to do. And that we may be  faithful in the performance thereof  is my prayer in the name of Jesus.   Amen. 
 DISCOURSE  By Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, Taber-  nacle, Sunday, a.m, April 22, 1860.    REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.    I always feel much pleasure in addressing a   congregation of the Saints when I am inspir-  ed by the Holy Ghost, for then I can be of   benefit to those who hear.    I realize that, until the priesthood was res-  tored to the earth, we had no way of knowing the   truth in relation to the gospel of Jesus Christ.   It is true there were a great many anxiously   seeking to know the Lord, but there were none  that were able to give them the comfort and  consolation they desired.    If a person goes without food for twenty-  four hours, we all know that that individual  will become very hungry; and it is precisely  so with those who hunger for the principles of   eternal life. While we enjoy the Spirit of the  Lord, we shall find that there is enough and   an abundance to feed every human soul.    I have never seen the day nor the hour that  I was not susceptible of being taught by my   brethren, neither have I ever seen the time  that I thought I knew all the principles of the   gospel, and I can truly say that I feel as much  edified to-day in contemplating the things of   God as ever I did in any hour of my life. We  are all dependent upon the Lord, upon his holy  Spirit, and upon the testimony of the Lord Je-  sus Christ for instruction, for light, and knowl-  edge, such as is calculated to edify, encourage,   sustain and aid us in magnifying our callings  in this life.    We need not enter particularly into the  great mysteries of the kingdom of God in or-  der to be edified. A man may preach upon  the first principles of the gospel, and he will  find enough in them to instruct the people and  edify himself in the things of God. Those   principles are plain, they can easily be com-  prehended when presented to the children of   men as they are revealed from heaven.—  But, as plain and simple as they are, for   eighteen hundred years, the world was almost   destitute of a knowledge of the truth, and of  the Holy Ghost which is poured out to lead   mankind in the way of truth. From the time   of the great falling away, which took place in  the early part of the Christian era, up to the  present time, the world have been ignorant   with regard to the first principles of the gos-  pel of Jesus Christ. It is true that professed   Christians have had the examples of the Proph-  ets and Apostles from their childhood up, as   laid down in the New Testament, and yet they   have been far from the truth, and did not know  the correct way of worshipping God. It has   been a mystery to you and to me that we have  never been able to unravel, or to find out by  our own wisdom, the true knowledge of God;   but the very fact that generation after gener-  ation have risen up and established systems   and organizations, all professing to be accord-  ing to the plan of salvation, and yet opposed  one to another, until they have raised up   scores of churches all differing on points of  doctrine, proves that there has been something   out of the way.    We know that we have the gospel of Christ  that has been revealed from heaven in this  generation, wherein is taught faith, repent-  ance and baptism for the remission of sins,  and that obedience to those doctrines will  bring all things to our remembrance and there-  by enable us the more perfectly to do the will   of God while we dwell here in the flesh. As  the scriptures have informed us—"There is a   spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Al-  mighty giveth it understanding." [##Job 32:8##] I do not  know that I can explain to you the reasons for   the great difference we see in mankind, rela-  tive to the principles of truth, but it has been   so in every age of the world, and when the   gospel has been preached the honest in heart  and meek of the earth have obeyed and been   sustained by it and they have been enabled to   pass through many scenes of trial and to en-  dure the persecutions that wicked men have  devised to afflict the people of God.    The faithful have always had a positive  knowledge that what they were doing was  right and acceptable to the Almighty, and that   they have been sustained in passing through  scenes of trial by the gift and power of God.   They have realized that it was better to sacri-  fice their lives for His kingdom than to live  and enjoy the riches and honors of this world  for a season. This principle sustained the   ancient Saints in all their affliction; it sustain-  ed them in the den of lions, and in the fiery  furnace, and although they frequently sealed  their testimony with their blood, they were   comforted and consoled in looking forward to   the time when the earth would enjoy her Sab-  baths, and the Saints enter into their rests.    The Jews marveled and wondered at the Sa-  vior, for they saw that he was filled with light  and truth. "They had eyes to see, but they   saw not." [##Matthew 13:13-15##] The Savior laid before them the  principles of truth, he came to them and un-  dertook to convert them, but he wept over  them when he saw what would be the conse-  quences of their hard heartedness, and how  the Jewish nation would be overthrown and  the people scattered among all nations, if they  rejected the doctrines he presented to them.—  He informed them what would be the result   of their disobedience, and told them that the   judgments of God would fall heavily upon   them. He portrayed to them the oppressions  and torturings with which they would be af-  flicted, foretold the destruction of the temple  that it would be thrown down, and that there   would not be left one stone upon another.—   The majority of them mocked his sayings, and   finally succeeded in putting him to death, but   yet all that he foretold the Jews has come to  pass. The predictions of Moses also, concern-  ing that nation, have been literally fulfilled,   and that too in such a plain, pointed and un-  mistakable manner that it seems almost im-  possible for a man to be a disbeliever in the   dealings of God with the Jewish nation.    Peter, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew  and the apostles generally warned that people;   but they spurned the servants of God and turn-  ed unto their idols. The apostles were in-  spired by the Spirit of God, they enjoyed the  gifts of the Holy Ghost, but the great mass of  the Jewish nation hardened their hearts and   would not listen to the words of life. I might   say the same in relation to the present gener-  ation. The church of Christ is organized pre-  cisely as it was in the days of the Apostles,   and we are living in the day and age of the   world when the righteous blood that has been   shed upon the earth will be avenged on the   disobedient because they reject that gospel  which would save them, and enable them to   assist in the great work of the redemption of   the dead. The gospel has been again restored   by the administration of an angel from heav-  en, whom the revelator John saw in vision   when on the isle of Patmos, and when describ-  ing it he says: And I saw another angel fly in   the midst of heaven, having the everlasting   gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the  earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and   tongue and people, saying with a loud voice,   fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour  of his judgment is come; and worship him that  made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the  fountains of waters.—##Revelation 14:6-7|Revelations, 14th chap.,   verses 6–7.##    Did you ever know the Lord to bring his   judgments upon any nation, from the days of   Adam in the garden of Eden until the present   time, before he had warned them of their sins?  No, the Lord has always warned the people  before he has punished them for their wicked-  ness. He warned Sodom and Gomorrah be-  fore he sent destruction upon them, and he   has done so in every age of the world. [##Genesis 18:20-33##] In   this generation the Almighty has raised up   a prophet who has organized the kingdom of  God, and thousands of the Lords annointed  have been inspired by the same spirit to pro-  claim the words of live to the people, and who   cannot foresee the judgments of God that  await this generation? After the testimony  of the servants of God, the judgments that   have been spoken of will be poured out upon   the wicked. Every man and woman who   lives up to principles of the gospel can see by   the same spirit; they can understand by the  things that are written in the scriptures, and   by the revelations of God that have been im-  parted unto us, and that are before the world,   that these things are hanging over the nations.    We have before us the example of the ante-  deluvian world; they were hard hearted and   unbelieving, and would not believe until it   was too late. The inhabitants of Jerusalem   did not believe that they would be surrounded  with those dire calamities that afterwards be-  fell them.    In looking at the judgments of the Almigh-  ty that we have witnessed, and have been cal-  led to pass through, we see plenty to arouse   us, and cause us to be diligent in the dis-  charge of our duties. The heavens are full   of judgments that are ready to be poured out  upon this generation, and the Lord has as   many ways in punishing the wicked as he  ever had in any previous dispensation. We   witness the power of God made manifest by   day and by night, and we ought to realize the  necessity of being obedient to all the require-  ments of heaven.    The Elders of Israel have gone forth and  borne a true and faithful testimony of the  gospel of Jesus Christ, and they have been as-  sisted by the gift and power of the Holy   Ghost. Our Prophet and Elders have been   filled with good desires for the people, and   have gone abroad and tried to bring mankind  to a knowledge of the truth. Our President   has cast his mind abroad over the world, and   in his meditations he has planned for the wel-  fare of the human family, and yet the wicked   have desired his life, and thousands have de-  spised him because he has reproved them for  their wickedness and advocated righteous   principles, and called upon them to repent of  their sins and be baptized according to the   order of God.    The Prophet Joseph was inspired to lay  the foundation of the Church and kingdom of   God; before that time the masses of mankind  were in darkness, the professors of religion   were deceived in regard to God and the things   of his kingdom. If the Lord had not sent   forth his servant Joseph, the devil would never   have wrought upon the hearts of the children   of men, as he has done, but because the Proph-  et was laying the foundation of that great   work which the Lord had determined to per-  form in the last days, the hearts of the chil-  dren of men were stirred up to roar against   the Lord's anointed. But the truth was bound   to prevail, and for the accomplishment of this  object the Prophet laboured day and night.    I know that Joseph Smith was a good man,   a Prophet, a Seer and a Revelator, and that  he sealed his testimony with his blood that  the nation that was worthy might receive   their reward. There is no principle revealed   in this generation but those which are known   by the Almighty to be for the salvation of his  creatures. The spirit of warfare that is mani-  fested in these days has existed in all ages   when the priesthood was upon the earth.   There was always a war between light and   darkness, God and the devil, saint and sinner,   correct principles and false doctrines. We our-  selves have a warfare with the evil propensities  of our nature; we have already had to meet a   warfare outwardly; in some instances there has  been a physical contest, and our enemies have   sought our destruction from the beginning.   That warfare will continue until satan is  bound and iniquity swept from the earth.   We need not suppose that we shall have peace,   for there will be no peace to the righteous   until he reigns whose right it is to reign. It   is in this generation precisely as one of the  prophets foretold it should be; "surely our  fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things  wherein there is no profit." [##Jeremiah 16:19##]    Thousands and millions of the sectarian   world are in this condition, and will be led to   use this or similar language. The honest   among them will get their reward, and it will  be far superior to any thing they have antici-  pated. It is true they entertain many false   doctrines, but let us remember that we believed   false doctrines, and were surrounded with the  traditions of our fathers, before we heard the  fullness of the gospel. When we heard its   principles taught we admired and received   them for the truth's sake, and rejoiced in the  blessings that followed our obedience.    We have now got a warfare to endure; we   must war against every evil principle until we  can learn to do right in all things. This is   the spirit we must learn to cultivate day by  day; the knowledge we have of the gospel will   assist us in doing this.    There is one peculiar feature connected with   the preaching of the gospel; you may send out   a thousand Elders and they will all teach the   same doctrines, they will all labor for the   building up of the same church, they will be  united, for their faith, their doctrines, and the   organization of the church have all been made  known unto them by the revelations of God;  hence they will see eye to eye in regard to the   principles of the gospel. Supposing a thou-  sand minsters of different denominations were  to be sent out into the world, it would be very  different with them, from what it is with the  Elders of the Church of Christ; they would   not be so united, nor so harmonious in their   sentiments. Our union and oneness of senti-  ment constitutes one of the prominent beauties   of the organization of the kingdom of God.    There was never any other gospel taught to   the old prophets, excepting that which is now  taught to you and to this generation; neither  was there ever any of the children of men   saved upon any other principle than that   which is now presented to the people. The  Church of Christ always had in it prophets,   apostles and patriarchs; it was always blest   with the gifts of inspiration, power to heal   the sick and to perform such miracles as were   necessary for the salvation of the Saints.    If you were to meet with Father Adam,   with Seth, Moses, Aaron, Christ or the   Apostles, they would all teach the same prin-  ciples that we have been taught; they would   not vary one particle. This gospel is everlast-  ing in its nature, and unchangeable in its   character. It might be urged that the house   of Israel had the law of carnal command-  ments, but that only acted as a schoolmaster   to bring them to Christ, because they would  not receive a celestial law. They had the   priesthood of Aaron for a series of years   amongst them, but the old apostles, prophets  and saints were saved by the gospel and not   by the law of carnal commandments.    I want to say a word about our present po-  sition. When we first received the gospel we   professed to rejoice in its principles, and in  the blessings which followed our obedience,  and should we not continue to rejoice and to   be diligent in the work of the Lord; yea,   even more so to-day than we did when we  first received it? When a boy begins his edu-  cation at school he begins at the first rudi-  ments, and continues to progress step by step.   It is so with the student in the study of the   everlasting gospel. There were not many   principles revealed to us when we first receiv-  ed it, but they were developed to us as fast as  we were capable of making use of them.    I well remember the first sermon I heard;  my conviction was that I had learned more  about God and the things of his kingdom than  I had learned in all my previous life. I be-  lieved the gospel then, and I not only believe   it now, but I know it to be true. Since then I   have received much valuable instruction thro'  the revelations of God that have been made   manifest; and I have never yet heard a princi-  ple set forth, but I have been able to see  beauty and glory connected with it.    The subject of the vision that was given to   Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, was alluded   to by brother Young and others during our   conference. In reference to that I wish to  say, that when I first read that vision, it swept   away a vail that had been around me all my   life, it opened my understanding and shook off   my shackles. There was some thing in it so   different from the old sectarian, notion, some-  thing that swept away the idea of one heaven,   one hell, and that those who do not go to one   place must go to the other; and that all in heaven   have an equal glory, and all in hell an equal   misery. There always appeared something   very inconsistent connected with the doctrine   of future rewards and punishments, as taught   by modern divines; but when I got hold of the   vision I saw more light, more consistency and   Godlike mercy and justice, than I had ever   seen in my life.    I refer to these things to show how the vail   was taken from my eyes, and how I was made   to comprehend that every man is rewarded ac-  cording to the deeds done in the body. I then   saw there was something to encourage a man  to be true and faithful, and to be filled with   integrity, while on the other hand, it was made   manifest that it would not pay a man to do  evil. Every man gets the reward he earns by   his labours. We can see this every day of our   lives. You never saw a man who had par-  taken of the blessings of the kingdom of God,  and then turned against the Lord, and would   do wickedly and blaspheme the name of the   Deity, but what the Spirit God would with-  draw from him and leave him miserable. The   hand of God always overtakes such a one,   evil lies in his path, and he is tormented by   day and by night. We have seen this during   our experience in this Church.    To me the principle of integrity is one of   the greatest blessings we can possibly possess.   He who proves true to himself, to his breth-  ren, to his friends, and his God, will have the   evidence within him that he is accepted; he   will have the confidence of his God and of his   friends. It is a great and a glorious principle;   it is something that gives you that assurance   in your friends that you can trust your prop-  erty, your life, your all in the hands of your   brethren.    The Lord has said, I will prove you in all   things, even unto death. [##Doctrine and Covenants 98:14##] How truly this has   been fulfilled in this church. Scores and hun-  dreds of our brethren have laid down their   lives in carrying out the principles of the gos-  pel of Jesus Christ; they have been hastened   away from this world by their enemies, but   they have maintained their integrity, proven   themselves to be true and faithful before the   Lord, and their spirits now mingle with the   spirits of the just.    We should all seek to do right, try to per-  form our duties day by day, to God and to   each other, and put away everything that   wars against the Spirit of the Lord.    I rejoice every day I live in beholding the   signs of the times, in looking at the progress   of the Church and kingdom of God upon the  earth. The Lord has guided and governed   us all the day long. We have every reason to   be thankful for his goodness unto us, and we   may rest assured that his blessings will be   poured out upon us just as fast as we are ca-  pable of receiving and making a right use of  them.    The judgments that are coming upon the   wicked will cause the ears of the children of   men to tingle and their hearts to quake. Do   you think they realize those things? No, they   do not; they are all in the dark, but it is just   as Elder Pratt said during our conference.—  After the testimonies of the servants of   God will come those of thunderings, earth-  quakes, pestilence, famines and the sword.—  The Lord also says by revelation, that when   these judgments do come, when they are   poured out upon the earth: "O ye nations of  the earth, how oft have I called upon you by   my servants, by the ministering of angels, and   by my own voice and by famines, tempest,  earthquakes and pestilence of every kind, and   would have saved you with an everlasting   salvation, but ye would not; behold the day   has come when the cup of the wrath of mine   indignation is full, and it shall be poured out   upon the disobedient." [##Doctrine and Covenants 43:25-26##]    Remember these things, for the words of   the Lord must be fulfilled. When a man who   believes the gospel reflects, he becomes satis-  fied that not one of those sayings will be suf-  fered to return unto the Lord void, but he re-  alizes that they will accomplish that for   which they were sent; but a man who knows   not God cannot realize anything about the cal-  amities that are to come upon the earth. You   might preach to him as long as Noah preach-  ed to the antediluvians; you might try till you   were grey with old age, and you would try in   vain to get him to understand the things of   God.    If we had correct understanding we should   all see as the Lord does, and should under-  stand how his purposes will be accomplished;   but we are to walk by faith and not by sight.    I feel to rejoice in knowing that the kingdom   of God is established on the earth, and that it   will spread itself abroad—become like a great   mountain, and finally fill the earth. The   words of the Lord will not return to him void;   but whether he speaks by his own voice or the   voice of his servants, those words will have   their fulfilment.    Let us be faithful, and adorn ourselves with   the graces of the gospel. There is nothing   gained by doing wrong. Lying, stealing,   blaspheming, drunkenness, backbiting and   denying the Lord Jesus Christ, bring sorrow   and remorse; it debaces man who is organized   in the image of God; but to do right, to obey   the commandments of God, to be charitable   and kind, brings joy and peace and the Holy   Ghost, and an eventual exaltation in our   Father's kingdom.    May we all so live that we may be worthy   to dwell in his presence in the world to come,   and to participate in the fullness of that glory   and blessedness promised to the faithful, is   my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.

Dear Brother:    Yours of the 9th, has been re'cd. Was pleased to  learn that I was worthy to be called as one among that   noble band of missionaries; but after much consideration  and consultation with Apostles Lyman and Lund I   was advised under my circumstances to be set apart and go  as a visitor, that I might return at the end of six months  to again live on our land. They said under these conditions  I would be permitted to take my child. I had only thought  of going as a vis^i^tor when Pres. Jack suggested to my   husband that I be called.    Am willing to devote all my time and do all I can   in my weak way while there.    Can be ready to go after the 1st, of Oct.    Would be pleased to know at what dates Elders  are going, as I do not desire to travel alone.    An early ans. will be greatfully accepted.    Your Sister in the Gosple  Estella Rust.    P.S.

 lower & dangerous ferry can be Entirely abandoned.  As it is there are the following objections to it    1. It is so far away ^from the house on the ranch^ that the traveler has  to wait—often for hours—until his presence  is discovered.    2. It is dangerous to cross on account of  its close proximity to the mouth of Marble  Canyon with its rapids.    3. At high water time when the water flows  swiftly it is altogether an impracticable crossing.    The upper crossing would be much the better,  but the horrible terrors of the steep, rocky and  dangerous road over to it from the lower ford  render it a frightful barrier. I personally know  of several families who have gone around by  rail rather than risk the possibility of having to   go over that dangerous road.    Hence the Ferry as it now is, is neither  attractive to travelers, convenient or safe.    Now may I suggest the following for  your Earnest consideration.

Dear Brethren:    A few days ago elder D. A. Damont, of this place,  called in to see me about his mission to the Southern States  to which he has been recently called.    He represents that since writing to you, he has  considered his circumstances more carefully and desires  to make the following representation:    He is owing for ^a^ new wagon and an interest in  a saw mill to the amount of 30000 and besides that  his home, which he values at $150000, is now under  mortgage for $40000 which mortgage falls due in about  one year from date. His crop of grain this season will  not clear off these accounts, and while his creditors  are willing to wait and he is willing to go now if it is  thought best that he should I believe it would be better to  allow him to stay at home for one year, in which time  he thinks, and it appears reasonable to me, that he can  pay off his obligations and leave his family in a more  satisfactory condition.    After furnishing you with this information Bro. Damont  is perfectly willing to leave the matter to your wisdome and will  cheerfully abide your decission. Your Brother Geo. C. Parkinson    Let him have a year with our  blessing & prayers for success. J. F. S.

 Easy & convenient Ferry is imperative, & it seems  to me this can best be accomplished by  abolishing the lower ferry entirely, constructing   an Easily graded road around the bluff to the  upper ferry, & there putting in a new boat  operated by a steel cable which would render  it as nearly absolutely safe as human skill  can accomplish.    I found Mr Emett a most conscientious  man, kindly disposed, hospitable & ready to give  me information I sought in regard to your  church. He opened my Eyes considerably and  made me acquainted with your history and  doctrines, for which I am thankful. Hence my  interest in the Ferry, added to the fast that my  visit was made to it for the purpose of  saving photographs to insert in a book  on the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River  which I have been working upon for the   past ten years.

I will  be on hand to fill a mission  to the Southern States on July 22, 97.  But would prefer, should it meet  your approval, to leave any time  after May 21, 1897. As my labor   after this date will not prevent   me from leaving home. Please  answer in regard to this matter  of, "The time of leaving." There is  a mistake in my address.   I am a member at the 3rd  Ward of Provo City, and have  been for 3 years. My bishop  (Wm J Lewis) came and asked

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF   LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. Dec. 7th 1887.    President L. W. Shurtliff,    Ogden, Weber Co.    Dear Brother:    The enclosed correspondence has been  received ^by^ me concerning an old case which has given, as  I understand, considerable trouble to President Taylor when  he was alive, and which was tried, I am told, by  the High Council in Ogden.    I would like, before answering Bro. Pidcock,  to learn from you any particulars that you can give  me concerning the treatment of the case by the High  Council or its decision. The facts are, an institution  like Z.C.M.I., incorporated under the laws of the  Territory, cannot be dealt with in a Church capacity. 
 and stated that the miss-  ion assigned me was  acceptable, and thought  I would be able to leave  February 20th—the date  named in your letter  for starting.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  Geo. H. Crow. 
 Geo. Powelson  Feb. 20 [18]97.    me, a few days ago If I   could go on a mission. I   answered, "Yes." So my address  can be changed from Goshen  (my former home) to Provo.    Hoping this will be a favorable  answer to the call made of  me. I remain    Your brother in the Gospel.  Geo. Powelson  Provo City, Utah    Bps William J. Lewis 
 No decisions made against it could be enforced by any  penalty, because an institution cannot be cut off from  the Church. But before giving this answer to Bro.  Pidcock I want to learn all that I can, so as to  answer intelligently.    Regretting to have to put you to this trouble,   and with kind regards,    I am    Your Brother,    W Woodruff    [sideways text] Pidcock [end of sideways text]
