On ariving at the door  of the uppermost prision. I beheld one of the 12 Apostles  of the Lamb who had been martered in America  Standing at the door of the prision holding a key with  which he unlocked the door &amp; went in &amp; I followed  him. He appeared to be of a large size thick set. Dark hair  Dark eyes &amp; eyebrows of a smileing countenance, &amp; on  his head was a Crown of Gold or sumthing brighter.  He was Dressed in a long white robe with the sleeves  plaited from the sholder to the hand. Upon his breast  were four stars * * * * apparrently like gold and a golden  gridle about his loins. his feet were bear from above  the ancles downwards and his hands were also bear.  As he entered the prision he seemed to stand about  3 feet from the floor (which was of Marble) as if  the place was not worthy for him to stand upon. A  vary ^brilient^ and glorious light serrounded him while the  rest of the Prision was dark. But his light was pecu- liar to himself &amp; did not reflect upon others who were  in the Prison who were surrounded with a gloom of darkne ss. On the right hand near the door stood John Westley  who on seeing the glorious Personage raised both hands  &amp; shouted Glory, honor. Praise, &amp; Power be asscribed  unto God &amp; the Lamb forever &amp; forever   Baptism of repentance for remission of Sins and the  gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.  When the hunderds of Prisoners gave a shout with a  loud voice saying Glory be to God forever &amp; ever The marble floor was then removed &amp; a river of water  clear as Cristle seemed to flow in its place. The Apostle  then called to John Westley by name who came forw- ard quickley and both went down into the water &amp;  he Baptized him &amp; coming up out of the water he  laid hands on him for the gift of the Holy Ghost at the  same time ordaining him to the Priesthood of Aaron The Apostle then retired to the place whare he stood at   ENDENTRY  A man by the name of Killham the leader of the New  Connection of Methodist and next John Madison &amp; then  Scott, &amp; John Tongue, the three latter were Methodist  Preachers with whom I had formerly been acquainted the next he Baptized was my Grandfather (Edmund  Whitehead) &amp; the next was my Uncle (John Whitehead)  &amp; the next was my sister (Elizabeth Olland) &amp; next  Samuel Robinson &amp; the next was my own Mother all these had lived &amp; died  Methodist &amp; I had been personally acquainted with  them all. And after this he Baptized all the prisoners  amounting to many hundreds. After they were  all Baptized the Apostle laid his hands on them &amp;  Confirmed them evry one. then instantly the darkness  dispersed &amp; they were all surrounded &amp; envelloped in  A Brilient light such as surrounded the Apostle at the  first &amp; they all lifted their voices with one accord  giving glory to God for deliverance. My Grandfather  then came to me &amp; blessed me saying the Lord bless  thee forever &amp; ever. art thou come to see us delivered My mother then came to me &amp; clasped me in her arms  &amp; kissed me three times &amp; said the Lord Allmighty  bless thee forever &amp; ever. I then awoke out of  the vision &amp; felt so happy &amp; overjoyed that I  knew not how to remain in bed. But waking my  husband we arose &amp; taking the Bible I opened  Providentially to the  gathered together   of  third time I opened it &amp; immediately cast my eyes upon  the 3 in Prison. Being before ignorant of these texts &amp; opening  upon each Providentially I was asstonished beyound meas ure. I would further state that at the time I had this  vision I had never herd of the Death of David W. Patten  whom I have since learned was one of the Twelve  Apostles of the Latter Day Saints in America &amp; was slain  in the late persecution in the fall of 1838. But in the  vision I knew it was an Apostle who had been slain  in America. Perhaps many will think lightly of this  vision But I hereby Sollemnly testify that I actaully  Saw &amp; herd in a vision what I have here related &amp; I  give my name &amp; set my seal in witness to the Same  well knowing that I must stand before the Judgment Seat of  Christ &amp; answer for this Testimony &amp;   ENDENTRY     the people at Herefordshire Eng  took a view of it through their glasses, the appearance  of the moon was as if it were painted red &amp; while  looking at it one part of it fell in peices &amp; the appearan ce of a soldier was seen in the moon with a white feath- er in his Cap the Number that was on his Cap ^was^ vary plain  &amp; a figure 8 on his shouldier, they saw his firelock &amp;  gun ready for Battle &amp; his dress was clearly seen    tends the gas lights at the Carpenters Hall was light- ing the Chandaliers for a publick discussion  12 of them burst in peaces Elder O Pratt stood  beside of me at the time, the man said he had  never seen such a thing before, this was to light  the Hall to accomodate Mr Berry who pledged  himself to prove the Book of mormon fals &amp; water  Baptism not essential unto Salvation    was at my Farmington  had Caught some fish, I thought I would go to fishing  to, I went under the saw mill &amp; the trench was full  of pickerel father shut down the gates &amp; the fish started  to run down stream with the water I run down to  the bottom of the Island jumped into the trench, &amp; caught  a great many large fish with my hands as they came  down.
