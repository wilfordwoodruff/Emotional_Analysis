Being carried away in a vision to the place of depart ed souls I saw 12 prision one above another vary  large and builded of solled stone. On ariving at the door  of the uppermost prision. I beheld one of the 12 Apostles  of the Lamb who had been martered in America  Standing at the door of the prision holding a key with  which he unlocked the door and went in and I followed  him. He appeared to be of a large size thick set. Dark hair  Dark eyes and eyebrows of a smileing countenance, and on  his head was a Crown of Gold or sumthing brighter.  He was Dressed in a long white robe with the sleeves  plaited from the sholder to the hand. Upon his breast  were four stars * * * * apparrently like gold and a golden  gridle about his loins. his feet were bear from above  the ancles downwards and his hands were also bear.  As he entered the prision he seemed to stand about  3 feet from the floor (which was of Marble) as if  the place was not worthy for him to stand upon. A  vary ^brilient^ and glorious light serrounded him while the  rest of the Prision was dark. But his light was pecu- liar to himself and did not reflect upon others who were  in the Prison who were surrounded with a gloom of darkne ss. On the right hand near the door stood John Westley  who on seeing the glorious Personage raised both hands  and shouted Glory, honor. Praise, and Power be asscribed  unto God and the Lamb forever and forever Deliverence has  Come. The Apostle then Commenced to Preach the  Baptism of repentance for remission of Sins and the  gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.  When the hunderds of Prisoners gave a shout with a  loud voice saying Glory be to God forever and ever The marble floor was then removed and a river of water  clear as Cristle seemed to flow in its place. The Apostle  then called to John Westley by name who came forw- ard quickley and both went down into the water and  he Baptized him and coming up out of the water he  laid hands on him for the gift of the Holy Ghost at the  same time ordaining him to the Priesthood of Aaron The Apostle then retired to the place whare he stood at   ENDENTRY first and John Westley then proceded to Baptize  A man by the name of Killham the leader of the New  Connection of Methodist and next John Madison and then  Scott, and John Tongue, the three latter were Methodist  Preachers with whom I had formerly been acquainted the next he Baptized was my Grandfather (Edmund  Whitehead) and the next was my Uncle (John Whitehead)  and the next was my sister (Elizabeth Olland) and next  Samuel Robinson and the next was my own Mother all these had lived and died  Methodist and I had been personally acquainted with  them all. And after this he Baptized all the prisoners  amounting to many hundreds. After they were  all Baptized the Apostle laid his hands on them and  Confirmed them evry one. then instantly the darkness  dispersed and they were all surrounded and envelloped in  A Brilient light such as surrounded the Apostle at the  first and they all lifted their voices with one accord  giving glory to God for deliverance. My Grandfather  then came to me and blessed me saying the Lord bless  thee forever and ever. art thou come to see us delivered My mother then came to me and clasped me in her arms  and kissed me three times and said the Lord Allmighty  bless thee forever and ever. I then awoke out of  the vision and felt so happy and overjoyed that I  knew not how to remain in bed. But waking my  husband we arose and taking the Bible I opened prom Providentially to the text Isaiah 24th they shall be  gathered together andc more and more astonished. I  opened agained the Bible  I again opened the Bible to the 1st  of St John The light shineth in darkness andc. and again the  third time I opened it and immediately cast my eyes upon  the 3rd chapter of Peter 18. 19. 20. speaking of the spirits  in Prison. Being before ignorant of these texts and opening  upon each Providentially I was asstonished beyound meas ure. I would further state that at the time I had this  vision I had never herd of the Death of David W. Patten  whom I have since learned was one of the Twelve  Apostles of the Latter Day Saints in America and was slain  in the late persecution in the fall of 1838. But in the  vision I knew it was an Apostle who had been slain  in America. Perhaps many will think lightly of this  vision But I hereby Sollemnly testify that I actaully  Saw and herd in a vision what I have here related and I  give my name and set my seal in witness to the Same  well knowing that I must stand before the Judgment Seat of  Christ and answer for this Testimony and   ENDENTRY SIGNS IN THE LAST DAYS   On the 9th of Aug 1840 their was a sign in the Moon the people at Herefordshire Eng  took a view of it through their glasses, the appearance  of the moon was as if it were painted red and while  looking at it one part of it fell in peices and the appearan ce of a soldier was seen in the moon with a white feath- er in his Cap the Number that was on his Cap ^was^ vary plain  and a figure 8 on his shouldier, they saw his firelock and  gun ready for Battle and his dress was clearly seen   On the 7th of Octobeb 1840 while the man that  tends the gas lights at the Carpenters Hall was light- ing the Chandaliers for a publick discussion  12 of them burst in peaces Elder O Pratt stood  beside of me at the time, the man said he had  never seen such a thing before, this was to light  the Hall to accomodate Mr Berry who pledged  himself to prove the Book of mormon fals and water  Baptism not essential unto Salvation   A Dream.

I then went to the mill and Brother Asahel Woodruff  who has been dead two years came and broght many fish  and showed me which he caught in the trench, we then comm- enced eating peaches with other friends and talked about  and rejoiced in the glories of IMMORTALITY   "The Rev London says,  As the prophecies concerning the birth, life, and death, of our  Lord were litterly fulfilled at his first Coming,  to the division of his garments and to the casting  of lots upon his vestures so evry prophecy and promise  respecting his Second Comingâ€” throneâ€” kingdomâ€” reign  judgmentâ€” powerâ€” with the changes predicted in the  worldâ€” elementsâ€” natureâ€” Condition of animals and the  like, shall be literally accomplished."
