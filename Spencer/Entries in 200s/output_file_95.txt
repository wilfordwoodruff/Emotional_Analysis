 G. S. L. city  Feby. 2 1857.  Elder Orson Pratt    Dear Bro,    The Eastern mail for Jan. last started, and went  about 11 miles to the top of the first mountain, and returned, one of the  party (not a mormon) having been froze to death in the snow, we have  not yet received any Eastern mail for the past months.    Judge Phelps reports the entire fall of snow in the city up to  the 24th. inst, has been over eight feet. We have more snow in the  mountains than we have ever known since our arrival in the vallies.  It has lain for several weeks in this valley between 2 & 3 feet deep. Many  have brought their cattle from the ranges Northward, also all the stock  of horses, cattle and sheep have been brought from the Island—as snow  is reported as being nearly 3 feet deep there—and fed them at home, &  large herds have been driven South into Utah valley, some cattle have  died, but as yet few in comparison to what died last Winter.    The work of the Reformation is progressing throughout this city &  Territory. President Young has given much valuable information during  this Winter to the Twelve and the people, the Spirit and power of God has  rested upon him, and his whole soul has been filled with charity, mercy,  long suffering, kindness, and a fatherly feeling towards his brethren and the  whole of this people, and he has greatly desired their salvation, and his  spirit has been cheered, and his heart made glad in seeing the people in  a measure beginning to awake to a realizing sense of their duties, and begin-  ning to feel the importance of magnifying their calling in the Priesthood and  of building up the kingdom of God. The Tabernacle on Sunday, is now  crowded to overflowing in almost any stage of the weather, and hundreds  go away that cannot get in either to sit or stand. For several 
 G. S. L. City Feby. 4 1857  Editor of the Mormon    Dear Sir,  We have not received any Eastern mail for the last 3 months  Mr. Gerrish arrived from the Plains on the 19th. ulto, reports a mail  somewhere on the way. We have received the California Mail regularly up to  this time, by which we occasionally hear something from the lower world.    The Jan. mail for the East was sent out, but only got to the top  of the little mountain, before it was stopped by the vast quantity of snow,  and one carrier froze to death, the remainder returned. We are passing thro'  the most severe winter so far as snow is concerned that we have ever ex-  perienced in the vallies, the mountains are full, and over 8 feet has  fallen in this city acording to Judge Phelps' report, it has been for a  month between 2 & 3 feet deep in our streets, and about 3 feet on the islands  & more North. all the stock have been brought from the Island, and  some from the North, and were fed in the city, some driven South, and  some to Rush valley, notwithstanding the great amount of snow there has  been but few of the stock lost in comparison to the loss last winter.  The  abundance of Snow in the mountains will be of great benefit for irri-  gation the coming season, the Earth needs it as it has been very dry fo[r]  two years. The wheat which was sown in the dry dust last Fall  has sprouted under the snow, and grown several inches, we have had a  constant thaw for about one week past, which causes the water to gradually  soak into the soil. The inabitants of this city have again commenced labor  upon the cotton wood canal, to bring that stream to this city, and they  expect to finish it by the opening of Spring, the inhabitants of Davis  County have also commenced on a canal to take out a portion of the  Weber river into Davis County for irrigation, mills &c. 
 On Sunday the 1st inst. all the Presidency were present, the  first time that Prest. Young has been able to attend at the Tabernacle  since the burial of Prest. J. M. Grant on the 4th. Decem. ulto. He ad-  dressed the people for about one hour and a half, clothed with the spirit  and power of God, his discourse was very edifying and instructive and the  vast assembly deeply felt the weight of his words. He was followed by  Prests. Kimball & Wells, all of their discourses will be seen in the Deseret  News.    Prest. Joseph Young has had a severe time of sickness this  winter, he was very low, but is now much recovered and able to be among  his brethren, and attend to the duties of his calling as President of the  Seventies.    Elder Dan Jones has been employed while the weather  would permit in fitting up a craft with which to explore Salt Lake,  and the mouths of Bear river and the Jordan, and to find what  navigation is practicable on the Lake and its tributaries, he is now  trying to boat fire wood from Stansbury Island to Black rock, from  which point is can easily be drawn into the city. The Blacksmiths at  the public works finished him an anchor weighing 330 lbs for his boat.    The Bishops of the various Wards are making their calcul-  ations to finish off the Canal this Spring so that the waters of the  Big cottonwood can be used on our farming land and in the city.    Feby. 4 2 p.m. Cala. mail has just arrived.    yours truly  W. Woodruff

 the parable of the vineyard, the vine &c., to illustrate his ideas, his  teachings have been of much benefit to the Saints. The Twelve who  were here, have gone forward with the missionaries through every ward  in the city, teaching the Elders and the people, meeting with the various  Quorums of the church, we have attended a meeting of some kind al-  most every evening for three months. The people are rising up en masse  and trying to live their religion, by confessing and forsaking their sins,  and preparing for the waters of Baptism, the spirit and power of  God is manifest in Zion. The word of the Lord through his  servants who are clothed with the power of God and the fire of the  Holy Ghost causes the sinner to humble and fearfulness to surprize the  hypocrite, and the people universally feel like putting away sin and  iniquity of every kind. all places of worship both in the city and country  are crowded to excess. The people are beginning more to feel the importance  of living their religion, magnifying their calling and building up the  kingdom of God. Their has been four of the quorum of the Twelve in  this city during the sitting of the Legislature viz. O Hyde, L. Snow,  F. D. Richards & myself. Elder Hyde has now gone South on a  mission through the city and brother Snow is mostly confined to Box  Elder. Elder Richards & myself remain in this city at present.  we expect Elders A. Lyman & C.

The heavy damages done by the  floods in the Rio Virgin, are extremely lamentable.  but I hope the losses may in some measure be com-  pensated by the increased safety and facilities  accruing from the new arrangements now  in contemplation, for taking the water out farther  up the stream. I understand a large amount  of land will be brought under irrigation by  the new canal, which should be awarded in some  way to those whose lands have been washed away.    I hope you and your daughter from San Pete  will enjoy a most pleasant and agreeable visit.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. May 29th, 1889.    Elder William Atkin,    Dear Brother: Your letter of May 20th is before me. I make it a  point to answer all letters as far as I can as they come before me. My health  is about as usual, except a severe cold that for a day or two deprived me of  speech. Brother Geo. Q. Cannon and myself have been attending conferences of late.  We went through Sanpete, attended the conference, and held nine meetings, and one  at Nephi. We had full houses, and much interest was manifested. The sectarians,   priest and people, attended some of our meetings. We attendod the Tabernacle in  this City last Sunday. Brother Geo. Q. Cannon spoke and occupied the time, as I  was too hoarse to speak at all. All our crops are quite forward. We have had  some fine rains; but it is getting dry again. They are beginning to cut the first  crop of lucern. Concerning the Government I can only say that Harrison is  showing his hand by appointing such men as Thomas for Governor and Zane for Crhief  Justice; and it seems as though he intended to make a clean sweep of all Democrats  and put in Republicans in their place. I do not look for much peace in Utah during  his reign. The "ring" intend to steal S. L. City at the next election; but it rather  looks as though they wont be able to do it. My family are generally well.    Remember me kindly to all your family. Emma and Alice wish to be remembered to you.    As ever, Your Brother,  W. Woodruff 
 and I would like very much to drop in to see you,  but there seems very little prospect for any such  an event happening very soon.    In regard to the "Temple Tank," I would like   to know where it is located, and what are   its dimentions. How long, and broad, and  deep. How many gallons of water it will  hold and all the particulars, as I have not  heard anything about it to my recollection.  I suppose it is to be at or near the spring, or  source of supply, but I would like you to tell  me all about it, and what it will cost. It seems  as though you were working at great disadvan-  tage while the roads and weather are so bad.    I have got over my cold, and am enjoying  very good health, but the pressure of the times feels  like a heavy weight upon me. But we are in the   hands of the Lord, and "He doeth all things well."  May  the Lord bless you and your family and all the saints is my  prayer. With kind regards I am your Brother, W Woodruff

Dear Brother: I received your letter of April 8th, but have never had a  moment that I could answer it until now.    Brother Geo. Q. and myself enjoy our freedom very much. We held 12 meetings  in three days in Utah County, and I had a very interesting conference on Sunday  and Monday last at Brigham City. About two thousand of the inhabitants met us at  the depot on our arrival on Sunday, and we had much of the spirit of teaching and  instruction on our meetings. I start in the morning for Logan, to attend the  conference there on Sunday and Monday. Brother Geo. Q. and myself have recently  returned ofrom a mission to California, where we spent ten days and had a very  interesting time, only I was sick three days. We saw a great deadl and a great many  people, and traveled considerably in the State. We went to Monterey and north of  the Geysers. We were satisfied from our observation of men and things that the  Lord is at work for us, although, of course, the devil is against us.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff reasoned upon the  responsibilities which rest upon those who  have received the priesthood, and upon all  the Saints, to do right, and live according to the  principles of the gospel. The mission to work  righteousness and spread the truths of the gos-  pel is not a work of a year or two; but continues  as long as we continue to hold the priesthood,  which is everlasting in its duration as is the  work to be performed by it; and if we remain  faithful, we shall eternally hold that authority,  growing and increasing in everything that is  exalting in its character and saving in its na-  ture. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff in a few spirited re-  marks showed that individuals or a people who  are led to obey the commandments of God by  seeing miracles, require to be fed with miracles  constantly or they will apostatize and forsake  the truth. Such has been our whole experience,  and so it was with ancient Israel as a people  from the time that Moses led them out of Egypt  until Jerusalem was taken by the Roman arm-  ies and its inhabitants dispersed. [##Exodus 14##] Their faith  was strong only as the Lord manifested His  power visibly in their behalf. They who embrace  the gospel for love of the truth, receive the Spir-  it of truth and have the testimony abiding with  them; they receive a glory in proportion to their  faithfulness and righteousness. 
 Elder W. Woodruff showed that the testimo-  nies borne by the elders who come to the stand  to-day are the same as those that were borne  by the elders thirty years ago. He treated on  the subject of men being inspired from Heaven  for the accomplishment of certain purposes, as  Columbus to seek this continent; Washington  and others to struggle for freedom, right and  liberty; and the signers of the Declaration of  Independence in the work they did. The elders  of this Church are inspired to do good and  spread the truths of Heaven; and their minis-  trations have been extended to every land  where they have been permitted to carry the  gospel, furthering the great designs of the Lord  that are to be accomplished in this age.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff said, this is  the first time I have visited your valley.  You have a beautiful valley, good crops,  comfortable houses and a good house to  worship God in. There is no genera-  tion has greater blessings than this peo-  ple in the mountains. The people of  the whole earth are ruled by the devil,  but the Holy Priesthood has ruled in  these valleys from the first; the devil  does not bear rule in Utah. You may  give your children earthly riches which  may all pass out of their hands, but a  good education will remain with them.  The rising generation have got to carry  out the great labor of this kingdom in  its ultimate power and increase; our  sons and daughters should be prepared  for this work. It has been said that no  man is educated unless he knows where  he came from, what he is here for,  where he is going, and what he is going  to do in the eternal world; if this is the  case, I think that there are but few ed-  ucated in the world. Congratulated the  people on their pleasant location. 
 We had quite a celebration here on Tuesday, April 30th, the same as was  held, I suppose, throughout the United States. You wilol see the oration and sppeches  and proceedings in the Deseret News.    Business increases upon me almost daily, until I sometimes hardly know  how to wale through it. I am glad to hear of your prosperity, and that your family  and sheep are doing well, and that another of your sons is married. I expect every-  thing looks forward and flourishing with you. We are having a very early spring,   but a very dry time; scarcely any snow in the mountains. It is the dryest season  probably we have ever had. Unless we have rain, the crops will fail in a great  measure. We have no officers yet appointed for Utah. I am in hopes that when  any are appointed they will be from outside of the Territory, which I rather  think will be the case.    You must excuse short letters from me these days. Give my love to your  wife and to your sons and daughters. Emma wishes to be remembered to you and  family.    As ever, Your Brother,    W Woodruff

Only one thing will prevent  it, and that is the illness of my son. He was cured of the  Pneumonia and a relapse brought on the grippe, from which he is   still confined to his bed, and no one can tell when we can leave  him. If he can be left, we will be there to personally congrat-  ulate Mrs. Woodruff for such a long life of happiness with so good  a man, and to congratulate you upon the possession of so good a   wife, and the possession of the love and respect of every man,  woman and child that ever came within the circle of your good and  honorable influence.    May God grant, that your days may be prolonged to the  extreme limit of man's life's-span, and that yourself and good  wife may find peace in that home for all the good in heart and  pure in mind.

Dear Brother William: Your letter of Feb. 4th came duly to hand. Press   of other matters has prevented me from answering sooner. Since then, as you are   aware, Brother Geo. Q. has regained his liberty, and is now greatly enjoying it   and improving by visiting and meeting with the saints whenever opportunity   permits. On his first sentence he received no benefit of the "Copper Act", as  it is called, because the term of imprisonment was shorter than the law contem-  plated for such benefits. But under the second sentence- 100 days- he got the  full benefit allowed by the "Copper Act"- that is, five days off per month, or   about fifteen days.    In regard to getting a State goverment for Utah, I cannot see but it will  be just as consistent for the Lord to soften the hearts of the "powers that be"  to give the people of Utah their rights, in some small degree, in the form of a  State goverment, as to soften them to administer the harsh laws they have made   to rule us by, in some degree of mildness and humanity.

Dear Brother:    Your letter of Feby. 3rd came duly to hand. Press of business has  prevented an earlier reply. It is gratifying to hear that your daughter May is so  rapidly recovering from her illness, and that the other members of your family are  all enjoying the inestimable blessing of good health. The tidings of the marriage  of your son John, and of the prospective marriage of Joseph very soon, to two sis-  ters, is good. It is right and proper for the sons of Zion to marry the daughters   of Zion, and through faithful, honorable and upright lives fulfil the measure of   their creation and their destiny. I congratulate them and wish them continual pros-  perity and eternal happiness through fidelity to the cause of Zion.    I join you in the hope that not many of our poor brethren will be   great losers in the damage done by the late floods in the Rio Virgen, and that  although the land which has been washed away is effectually lost to them, that  they will make it up by getting land above, although they may not have to expend  their labor for it. Even that will be much better than no land at all in lieu of  that washed away. My family are usually well. My own health is very good now, for  which I am exceedingly thankful, although I took a slight cold yesterday, but I  hope it won't amount to much.

Elder William Adkin,    St. George    Dear Brother:    Your letter of March 24th is before me. I have not had time to an-  swer it before. In regard to the water question for the St. George Temple I wish   to say, we have again consulted Brother Ottinger and laid before him the views of   Brother Thompson and yourself: and he says that he will warrant that inch and a   half pipe to deliver 435 gallons of water per minute, and that ought to satisfy us   all. It is as much water as we will need, and I trust to his judgement, he being so   well aquainted with hydraulics. I have written to Brother McAllister and Brother   Thompson upon this subject. I am glad you and your family are getting better. I   had a very severe attack two days ago which lasted several hours, but through ad-  ministering, etc. I was delivered. I feel al^l^right to-day. My family are generally   well. We are preparing for Conference; we expect a large company of people. A   good share of the Quorum of the Twelve will be with us; and I hope we shall have a   profitable time.    Of course you know our city is in the hands of the Gentiles, and of   course they will take advantage of us in every respect they can; but we have to   trust in God. As I am very busy to-day I can only write a short letter. Remember   me kindly to your family and inquiring friends. God bless you all.    Your Brother in the Gospel,    W Woodruff

Atkin,    Dear Brother:    I have received your two letters, one of July 3rd and   the other of the 15th. Of course, I am glad to hear from you. I have just   returned from a journey of two weeks in the mountains. I came home almost a  cripple, having broken a blood vessel in my right leg, which lames me for the   time being.    Now concerning our waterworks. It seems that there has been quite a  mistake in the expectation of that piping. I have heard nothing at all from   Brother McAllister on the subject. I do not know yet what will pbe done in the   matter.    My family are as well as usual. I had Emma, Blanche and Owen with me  in the mountains. We spent our time in camp; did considerable fishing in the  Weber river; caught some 200 trout. I did not catch a great many myself, because   it was too hard work to follow the stream. Owen scared up a very large panther,   and shot at and hit him with bird shot, But, of course, that is all the good it   did, so far as stopping him was concerned.

And being  such, we would, in the event of the disruption of the general goverment, be  independent of all earthly powers and clothed with legal as well as divine  authority to assume the possition in the earth of God has designed or may design us to   fill in such an event. As Statehood seems to promise the readiest solution of   some of the prominent questions involved in the great problem of the hour, and no   other way  has as yet been manifested, it would seem proper for us to bend our   faith and energies in that direction, that, if it shoul prove to be the will of  the Lord, we may be found striving for that object; and should it not prove to be  the will of the Lord for us to get a State goverment, then would be justified   in that we acted according to the best light and wisdom we possessed. And in   conclusion upon this point, I may add that if it be the will of the Lord that  Utah should become a State, "all hell will be powerless to hinder it," just as   you say, and certainy we should be found in accord with God's will. It is proper   that we should strive to accomplish His purposes, always acting upon the best light   we possess.    I am glad to hear that little Nellie was preserved through her sore

My Beloved Parents:    This being your   native day: the on which two such   noble spirits came into the world,   I feel it my pleasure to write you  my hearty congratulations and greetings  on this so dear to me, anniversary of   your Birth-day. Though thousands of miles   of land water seperate us, for   a cause not to gratify any selfish   desire of my own but to bear glad   tidings to the children of men, my   thoughts wander back to the warm  breath of living Parents and I am   with, ^you^ if not in body yet in spirit.  This is the third time your Birthday   has come and gone; or indeed the fourth   sfoince I met with you for this occasion.  Oh how good it would seem to be   with you tonight! what joy would my   heart feel to spend this quiet evening   in the family circle of Home. Still I   would not complain as God has been   so merciful to ^you^ and spared your 
 3    affliction and was spared. To God be ascribed the honor, though the services of  Dr. Higgins were had.    Wilford is living in the city, has quit farming, and is now engaged   delivering goods for Z. C. M. I.    The visitation of such a heavy snow storm, at the season of the year  you wrote, is rather an unusual occurence for "Dixie," but none the less welcome to  the farmer and owner of stock. Our winter has been open and dry. We are threat-  ened with another dry season, which will be srerious for the farmers, as the   two or three past seasons have also been very dry. We have just had some very  nice gentle rains, which have moistened the ground and will be a great help to   plowing and seeding.    It looks now, in view of the constantly increasing labors devolving upon  me, as though I would not get an opportunity very soon of again disturbing the  fish and game of the pond, as in days past; but in that regard my inability or  disappointment will be their pleasure, no doubt.    Doubtless, the decision of the Supreme Court, for wich we are looking   hourly, will be a "mixture of good and bad." But we shall rejoice if any good   shall come to us out of thatrpolitico-judicial Nazareth. We will thank the Lord  for any right that may be vouschsafed to us, and for all favors we will praise Him,

My dear ones if   I neglect your letters it is not because   I wish to but because business has   been crowding onto me so I could find   no time to attend to my correspondence.  It may be if you do not get a letter   for some time you begin to get anxious   so I want to tell you I am feeling   fine in the good work and do not   feel to complain of anything but make   good use of every moment during the   remainder of my time. Bro. Wilkins will   go home in April and you may look   out for me I think a few months  later. It would be a great pleasure to   me if I could accompany Prest. A. H.  Lund home but do not have any   idea when he will return to good,  old America or when I will get   my release. There is going to be a   great fair here in Berlin which will   in many ways almost equal the   Chicago Fair; it commences on the 1st    of may, I would like to get a glimpse

[##Joshua 4:1-9##] This was  in the year of 2942; so the Israelites crossed the Jordan on dry  land, similar to the Red Sea under the command of Joshua  &c. and encamped in full strength in the plains of Gilgal; the  reason the st Sun & Moon stood still at the command of  Joshua, was owing to the Amorites worshiping them as their  gods so Joshua made them retreat from their gods in terror  & with great slaughter. [##Joshua 5:1##] 5 (Moses & Aaron) Aaron  Died on Mount Hor [##Numbers 20:28-29##] but Moses created a pillar before his  death on Mount Ebel (on the other side of Jordon) & inscribed  on it, or the blessings of obedience & the curses of Disobedience  which he pronounced at that time in the presence of all the  congregation of Israel.

Wilford Woodruff  My Dearest Father:    You will no doubt have though me a   very ungreatfull son before this; as I   have not answered your kind favor of   the 5th together with Ovando's of Mch. 3rd   containing the money you sent me. It was   indeed a great surprise to me and   I fear you have done yourself an   injustice in sending me the last ammount.  Am truely thankfull to you and what  you sent will see me off in great   shape. Should have answered before but   have been on the go all the time &  I know if you do not hear from me   very often now, we still have the   hope of seing each other in the near   future so you will please pardon my   tardy letters. Am having quite a   lovely time getting Bro. Wilkins off;  he starts Monday and will sail on   April 23rd from Glasgow. I will likely be  coming along a few months later if   our Prest gets through with me. Prest.  Naegle has written me nothing definite  about my release but has hinted at   it. I am feeling fine in my work and 
 writing.    President Cannon is in the east, working for our cause against the  powerful agencies now operating for the defilement of Zion. Surely Satan has great  power and his struggles are desperate, knowing his time is short. But the Kingdom  of God will prevail and eventually triumph gloriously. Brother J. F. S. is where I  can reach him when necessary, and although chafing somewhat in spirit at the con-  dition of things, he is in no way visibly impaired by his long exilement.    Your description of the Temple tank and explanation of the manner of its  construction are all I could wish, and the matter of your opinion in regard to  the capacity of the lower end of the pipe, I think, is worthy of due consideration.  It might be well for you to explain your views fully to Pres. McAllister and Brother  Thompson, and if they argree with you, let them bring the matter beofore us and we  will give it attention.    With kind regards,    Your Brother,    W. Woodruff

Wilford Woodruff    Dear Father:  It has been some time since I received your   kind letter. Was highly honored to hear from you   and very glad you were so well and enjoyimg   yourselves so much. All is well at home and  everything looks well. There was a large house burned  down next to Sep. Sears. the place was suppose to   have been set on fire by Tramps.    Through the goodness of the Lord we as a bank are   able to meet the demands of our depositors.    We are receiving something every day, some days as  high as One Thousand Dollars.    I have had one letter from Blanche, which I appre-  ciated very much. Henry and Family have gone  home they went on the 4th  of this month.

All that will make you   more happy and be of comfort to   you is my greatest wish and may   He who has guided your footsteps so   safely through the ruggged paths of   life let His guardian angles watch   over you through the day and guard   your pillow at night, that you may   live many years yet to be in   the future what you have been to   us all in the past.    I look forward with the greatest joy and   hopes that I may be with you to   celebrate your next Birthday. Many  times I wonder how you will have   changed in my absence as I have  been away so long the thoughts of   returning to you and Home seem too   grand to be real; but still I am   contented and happy to think I am   where you want me to be and   when duty calls me; here in a far

My family are usually well, and I am recovering from a severe cold con-  tracted by over-exertion and improper ventilation during my recent visit to Utah  County, where Brother Cannon and I attended twelve meetings in three days. I  have never visited any part of Utah where there seemed more need of preaching the  good word than in Utah Co. After four years or more of comparative seclusion,  Brother Cannon and I had a feeling akin to that of young Elders or boys starting  out upon a mission. I enjoyed it very much, with the exception of taking a cold.    With love to all,    I am your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff 
 as life lasts.    Elder J. J. Toronto who has just finished a   31 month mission amongst the french-speaking   people of Switzerland has been with me   for about a week; he is on his way to   Italy and perhaps to Cisily where he has   relatives. I was indeed glad to see him and   assist him in seeing Berlin. He has fulfilled  a fine mission and rejoices in the good   work he has been able to do. On returning  to Salt Lake I have requested him to call  on you; that is if he gets home before   I do. It may be some months before   he completes his tour but will no doubt   call on you several months before I   am permitted to do so.    Cornelious has not yet arrived but I am  looking for him in a few day; when  he comes and gets a little acquainted, I   must go to Stettin and visit our Branch  there and then as soon as circumstances   will permit shall go to to Soran and visit  the good saints who are left with out a   shepherd on account of the persecution forbidding   an Elder to remain there. I will be glad   to get out of Berlin for a while after having  been walled in for about four months, without   any change whatever. I think it will do me

 of that, pay Frankfurt-on-the-Main a  visit and then when they say "it is   enough" I will go down the Rhein   to Mainz, Borgen, Cablenz and to Cologne  & in less than two days I could be   in London. The Route I have named   is not out of my way & I trust we   may be able to arrange it for Bro.  J. M. Weiler and I to be released   at the same time & go via the   route I have mentioned. Of course  have seen the Rhein but the Saints  in Frankfurt are very anxious for me   to visit them again & it would be   a great satisfaction for me to do so.  It would not be nice to go home  untill about the first of May anyway   as  the ocean voyage, would not be   as pleasant, By Jove it will be   great to be tossed about on the white   caps again and I am sure I shall   enjoy my voyage this time. Well  the good work in Berlin is progress-  ing, we had a baptism Friday night   & expect some more next week & some   in the near future in the Sorau  district where I have been at work.  I tell you it makes us boys happy 
 find a great deal to do. If all goes   well we are going to have a   baptism again tonight; so you see the   Church in Berlin is still growing a  little. If any one in the world has   cause to be humble and thankful  to God it is your son Owen for   when I look back is wonderful how   the Lord has blessed me while laboring  in His vineyard. I feel to rejoice &   my greatest desire is to become more   worthy of the favor of the Almighty   as I advance in years. I am aware I   am but a beginner but desire to   lay a good foundation on which I   may build a solid house.    We Elders are having a good time together   and our meetings and labors are   attended with a good spirit. The  weather is beautiful and the trees are   all rapidly putting on the appearance   of Spring. Shall keep you posted as   to my whereabouts and what I am   doing. Accept my sincere thanks for   your kindness untill I am able to express  my gratitude in another way. May God   continue to bless you with health & all  that you can wish, With love  Owen

A whole swarm of letters came from   Elders, Saints and Friends in Dresden and   in Berlin. They remembered me with several nice  and usefull little presents which were appropr  iate; such as a pair of wollen socks, a dozen  linnen collars, a pocket-book & etc.    In the evening members of our choir came  and furnished beautifull music from quartette  and chorus. We have a splendid choir here  in this Branch one that would do credit   to many a Wd at home. There are  several members who play the violin which   is a pleasant feature of our little mission.  The warm love which the good souls showed  me was truly something to prized and   which I consider dear by far than gold   or silver and pray God will give me  strength to be true to the confidence of  such good people.    Amidst all trouble and trials still I have   much to be thankfull for and rejoice   to think God has thought me worthy   (weak stick that I am) to pass through   the present experience for his Gospel's sake.

 love, and wish you many, many happy   returns of the day. Was so glad to   learn from your last letter of Clara's   improvement as I had an awful dream  in which I thought she had been   called away; suppose it came from over   anxiety as I had been thinking so much  about her & the thoughts of parting with   Clara would almost drive me wild.  Ma's do saying "dream of a death & hear  of a wedding."  Was indeed surprised to   receive a card of the wedding of W.  S. Woodruff and Fannie M. Carrington,  I do not remember the lady but hope she   will make Will a good wife as I think  a great deal of him. Think that Child  sister should be taken in hand by   some relief society as you should not be   troubled with such things, but of course   you know your own business. Well   dearest Parents I wish you the choicest   that earth can produce and the richest   blessings of God to accompany you   through still many years of health &   active, usefull life here on earth. With love   to yourselves, Clara, (who I hope is now well) and   all the dear ones at home,  Your affectionate son, A. Owen Woodruff    Expect to return to   Berlin in about a week

[##Exodus 3:5##] For say they, the Temple ws all Holy,  for the same reason, that is because of the extraordinary  presence of God thus residing in the Shekinah over the   Mercy Seat, (this was the sacred name) & for further  reasons it was most strictly exacted, that the priest should  ^be^ always barefoot in the Temple, but the Jews & eastern nations  uncovered their feet that no dust or pollution might  profane the Holy ground. [##1 Kings 8:10-11##] Hence putting off a shoe among  the ancients indicated reverence for the presence of God.  The customs was also expreniced of the cement of a bargin  or contract among the eastern nations; the party  conveying away a night or privilege took off a shoe &  gave it to his fellow, as a pledge of his fidelity.    Amongst the Jews it was a token of renunciations, thus the  kinsman of Ruth renounced his claim upon her in  favor of Boaz; she loosed his shoe from his foot to show  she was released from all engagments by which the laws  of her country, had bound her to the claims of her nearsest  relations &c, &c.

 April 2nd 1895    My dear Susan,    I have been trying for a good while to get a  moment to write a few lines to you and to Phobe but  I have not found time. Infact I have had so much to do  that I have not been able to accomplish my work as  it ought to be done. I received Phobe's letters on her  return home and I have not heard from you.    I have almost had a Hospital at our farm home.  Emma & myself have both got up from the grip  and now Alice is very sick with a hard cough and  low fever, but she seems a little better this morning.  All three of Clara's children have been very sick with  the measles but are getting better. Beulah has  been called suddenly to San Francisco to Calla  with "pneumonia", but she is better now.  I  dont know when she will return again. I hope  soon to learn that you are up again.    My love to all.    Your affectionate Father  W. Woodruff

Dear Sir    The term of office of the   present incumbent of the Postmas-  tership of this City will expire  during your term. Many good men   in this City have made an ef-  fort to secure the appointment.  Among the number Mr George A  Smith, a native of our soil, and  a descendant of the pioneers, has   made application. I regard him   as in every way fully compe-  tent to discharge the duties of  that office. He is a strictly tem-  perate man, thoroughly schooled  in business, industrious moral  and honest. You could not do   better in selecting a man to fill   that important place than to   appoint Mr Smith. He is backed
