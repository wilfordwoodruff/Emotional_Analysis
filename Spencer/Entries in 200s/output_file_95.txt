 G. S. L. city  Feby. 2 1857.Elder Orson PrattDear Bro,The Eastern mail for Jan. last started, and wentabout 11 miles to the top of the first mountain, and returned, one of theparty (not a mormon) having been froze to death in the snow, we havenot yet received any Eastern mail for the past months.Judge Phelps reports the entire fall of snow in the city up tothe 24th. inst, has been over eight feet. We have more snow in themountains than we have ever known since our arrival in the vallies.It has lain for several weeks in this valley between 2 & 3 feet deep. Manyhave brought their cattle from the ranges Northward, also all the stockof horses, cattle and sheep have been brought from the Island—as snowis reported as being nearly 3 feet deep there—and fed them at home, &large herds have been driven South into Utah valley, some cattle havedied, but as yet few in comparison to what died last Winter.The work of the Reformation is progressing throughout this city &Territory. President Young has given much valuable information duringthis Winter to the Twelve and the people, the Spirit and power of God hasrested upon him, and his whole soul has been filled with charity, mercy,long suffering, kindness, and a fatherly feeling towards his brethren and thewhole of this people, and he has greatly desired their salvation, and hisspirit has been cheered, and his heart made glad in seeing the people ina measure beginning to awake to a realizing sense of their duties, and begin-ning to feel the importance of magnifying their calling in the Priesthood andof building up the kingdom of God. The Tabernacle on Sunday, is nowcrowded to overflowing in almost any stage of the weather, and hundredsgo away that cannot get in either to sit or stand. For several 
 G. S. L. City Feby. 4 1857Editor of the MormonDear Sir,We have not received any Eastern mail for the last 3 monthsMr. Gerrish arrived from the Plains on the 19th. ulto, reports a mailsomewhere on the way. We have received the California Mail regularly up tothis time, by which we occasionally hear something from the lower world.The Jan. mail for the East was sent out, but only got to the topof the little mountain, before it was stopped by the vast quantity of snow,and one carrier froze to death, the remainder returned. We are passing thro'the most severe winter so far as snow is concerned that we have ever ex-perienced in the vallies, the mountains are full, and over 8 feet hasfallen in this city acording to Judge Phelps' report, it has been for amonth between 2 & 3 feet deep in our streets, and about 3 feet on the islands& more North. all the stock have been brought from the Island, andsome from the North, and were fed in the city, some driven South, andsome to Rush valley, notwithstanding the great amount of snow there hasbeen but few of the stock lost in comparison to the loss last winter.  Theabundance of Snow in the mountains will be of great benefit for irri-gation the coming season, the Earth needs it as it has been very dry fo[r]two years. The wheat which was sown in the dry dust last Fallhas sprouted under the snow, and grown several inches, we have had aconstant thaw for about one week past, which causes the water to graduallysoak into the soil. The inabitants of this city have again commenced laborupon the cotton wood canal, to bring that stream to this city, and theyexpect to finish it by the opening of Spring, the inhabitants of DavisCounty have also commenced on a canal to take out a portion of theWeber river into Davis County for irrigation, mills &c. 
 On Sunday the 1st inst. all the Presidency were present, thefirst time that Prest. Young has been able to attend at the Tabernaclesince the burial of Prest. J. M. Grant on the 4th. Decem. ulto. He ad-dressed the people for about one hour and a half, clothed with the spiritand power of God, his discourse was very edifying and instructive and thevast assembly deeply felt the weight of his words. He was followed byPrests. Kimball & Wells, all of their discourses will be seen in the DeseretNews.Prest. Joseph Young has had a severe time of sickness thiswinter, he was very low, but is now much recovered and able to be amonghis brethren, and attend to the duties of his calling as President of theSeventies.Elder Dan Jones has been employed while the weatherwould permit in fitting up a craft with which to explore Salt Lake,and the mouths of Bear river and the Jordan, and to find whatnavigation is practicable on the Lake and its tributaries, he is nowtrying to boat fire wood from Stansbury Island to Black rock, fromwhich point is can easily be drawn into the city. The Blacksmiths atthe public works finished him an anchor weighing 330 lbs for his boat.The Bishops of the various Wards are making their calcul-ations to finish off the Canal this Spring so that the waters of theBig cottonwood can be used on our farming land and in the city.Feby. 4 2 p.m. Cala. mail has just arrived.yours trulyW.

I make it apoint to answer all letters as far as I can as they come before me. My healthis about as usual, except a severe cold that for a day or two deprived me ofspeech. Brother Geo. Q. Cannon and myself have been attending conferences of late.We went through Sanpete, attended the conference, and held nine meetings, and oneat Nephi. We had full houses, and much interest was manifested. The sectarians, priest and people, attended some of our meetings. We attendod the Tabernacle inthis City last Sunday. Brother Geo. Q. Cannon spoke and occupied the time, as Iwas too hoarse to speak at all. All our crops are quite forward. We have hadsome fine rains; but it is getting dry again. They are beginning to cut the firstcrop of lucern. Concerning the Government I can only say that Harrison isshowing his hand by appointing such men as Thomas for Governor and Zane for CrhiefJustice; and it seems as though he intended to make a clean sweep of all Democratsand put in Republicans in their place. I do not look for much peace in Utah duringhis reign. The "ring" intend to steal S. L. City at the next election; but it ratherlooks as though they wont be able to do it. My family are generally well.Remember me kindly to all your family. Emma and Alice wish to be remembered to you.As ever, Your Brother,W. Woodruff 
 and I would like very much to drop in to see you,but there seems very little prospect for any suchan event happening very soon.In regard to the "Temple Tank," I would like to know where it is located, and what are its dimentions. How long, and broad, anddeep. How many gallons of water it willhold and all the particulars, as I have notheard anything about it to my recollection.I suppose it is to be at or near the spring, orsource of supply, but I would like you to tellme all about it, and what it will cost. It seemsas though you were working at great disadvan-tage while the roads and weather are so bad.I have got over my cold, and am enjoyingvery good health, but the pressure of the times feelslike a heavy weight upon me. But we are in the hands of the Lord, and "He doeth all things well."  Maythe Lord bless you and your family and all the saints is myprayer. With kind regards I am your Brother, W Woodruff

Q. and myself enjoy our freedom very much. We held 12 meetingsin three days in Utah County, and I had a very interesting conference on Sundayand Monday last at Brigham City. About two thousand of the inhabitants met us atthe depot on our arrival on Sunday, and we had much of the spirit of teaching andinstruction on our meetings. I start in the morning for Logan, to attend theconference there on Sunday and Monday. Brother Geo. Q. and myself have recentlyreturned ofrom a mission to California, where we spent ten days and had a veryinteresting time, only I was sick three days. We saw a great deadl and a great manypeople, and traveled considerably in the State. We went to Monterey and north ofthe Geysers. We were satisfied from our observation of men and things that theLord is at work for us, although, of course, the devil is against us.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff reasoned upon theresponsibilities which rest upon those whohave received the priesthood, and upon allthe Saints, to do right, and live according to theprinciples of the gospel. The mission to workrighteousness and spread the truths of the gos-pel is not a work of a year or two; but continuesas long as we continue to hold the priesthood,which is everlasting in its duration as is thework to be performed by it; and if we remainfaithful, we shall eternally hold that authority,growing and increasing in everything that isexalting in its character and saving in its na-ture. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff in a few spirited re-marks showed that individuals or a people whoare led to obey the commandments of God byseeing miracles, require to be fed with miraclesconstantly or they will apostatize and forsakethe truth. Such has been our whole experience,and so it was with ancient Israel as a peoplefrom the time that Moses led them out of Egyptuntil Jerusalem was taken by the Roman arm-ies and its inhabitants dispersed. [##Exodus 14##] Their faithwas strong only as the Lord manifested Hispower visibly in their behalf. They who embracethe gospel for love of the truth, receive the Spir-it of truth and have the testimony abiding withthem; they receive a glory in proportion to theirfaithfulness and righteousness. 
 Elder W. Woodruff showed that the testimo-nies borne by the elders who come to the standto-day are the same as those that were borneby the elders thirty years ago. He treated onthe subject of men being inspired from Heavenfor the accomplishment of certain purposes, asColumbus to seek this continent; Washingtonand others to struggle for freedom, right andliberty; and the signers of the Declaration ofIndependence in the work they did. The eldersof this Church are inspired to do good andspread the truths of Heaven; and their minis-trations have been extended to every landwhere they have been permitted to carry thegospel, furthering the great designs of the Lordthat are to be accomplished in this age.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff said, this isthe first time I have visited your valley.You have a beautiful valley, good crops,comfortable houses and a good house toworship God in. There is no genera-tion has greater blessings than this peo-ple in the mountains. The people ofthe whole earth are ruled by the devil,but the Holy Priesthood has ruled inthese valleys from the first; the devildoes not bear rule in Utah. You maygive your children earthly riches whichmay all pass out of their hands, but agood education will remain with them.The rising generation have got to carryout the great labor of this kingdom inits ultimate power and increase; oursons and daughters should be preparedfor this work. It has been said that noman is educated unless he knows wherehe came from, what he is here for,where he is going, and what he is goingto do in the eternal world; if this is thecase, I think that there are but few ed-ucated in the world. Congratulated thepeople on their pleasant location. 
 We had quite a celebration here on Tuesday, April 30th, the same as washeld, I suppose, throughout the United States. You wilol see the oration and sppechesand proceedings in the Deseret News.Business increases upon me almost daily, until I sometimes hardly knowhow to wale through it. I am glad to hear of your prosperity, and that your familyand sheep are doing well, and that another of your sons is married. I expect every-thing looks forward and flourishing with you. We are having a very early spring, but a very dry time; scarcely any snow in the mountains. It is the dryest seasonprobably we have ever had. Unless we have rain, the crops will fail in a greatmeasure. We have no officers yet appointed for Utah. I am in hopes that whenany are appointed they will be from outside of the Territory, which I ratherthink will be the case.You must excuse short letters from me these days. Give my love to yourwife and to your sons and daughters. Emma wishes to be remembered to you andfamily.As ever, Your Brother,W Woodruff

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICECHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.OFLATTER-DAY SAINTS.P. O. BOX B.Salt Lake City March 18th, 1889.William Atkin,Bloomington, Washington Co.Dear Brother William: Your letter of Feb. 4th came duly to hand. Press of other matters has prevented me from answering sooner. Since then, as you are aware, Brother Geo. Q. has regained his liberty, and is now greatly enjoying it and improving by visiting and meeting with the saints whenever opportunity permits. On his first sentence he received no benefit of the "Copper Act", asit is called, because the term of imprisonment was shorter than the law contem-plated for such benefits. But under the second sentence- 100 days- he got thefull benefit allowed by the "Copper Act"- that is, five days off per month, or about fifteen days.In regard to getting a State goverment for Utah, I cannot see but it willbe just as consistent for the Lord to soften the hearts of the "powers that be"to give the people of Utah their rights, in some small degree, in the form of aState goverment, as to soften them to administer the harsh laws they have made to rule us by, in some degree of mildness and humanity. We are now, politically

Atkin,Atkinville, Washington Co.Dear Brother:Your letter of Feby. 3rd came duly to hand. Press of business hasprevented an earlier reply. It is gratifying to hear that your daughter May is sorapidly recovering from her illness, and that the other members of your family areall enjoying the inestimable blessing of good health. The tidings of the marriageof your son John, and of the prospective marriage of Joseph very soon, to two sis-ters, is good. It is right and proper for the sons of Zion to marry the daughters of Zion, and through faithful, honorable and upright lives fulfil the measure of their creation and their destiny. I congratulate them and wish them continual pros-perity and eternal happiness through fidelity to the cause of Zion.I join you in the hope that not many of our poor brethren will be great losers in the damage done by the late floods in the Rio Virgen, and thatalthough the land which has been washed away is effectually lost to them, thatthey will make it up by getting land above, although they may not have to expendtheir labor for it. Even that will be much better than no land at all in lieu ofthat washed away. My family are usually well. My own health is very good now, forwhich I am exceedingly thankful, although I took a slight cold yesterday, but Ihope it won't amount to much.Emma and her family are well and would send love if they knew I was

I have not had time to an-swer it before. In regard to the water question for the St. George Temple I wish to say, we have again consulted Brother Ottinger and laid before him the views of Brother Thompson and yourself: and he says that he will warrant that inch and a half pipe to deliver 435 gallons of water per minute, and that ought to satisfy us all. It is as much water as we will need, and I trust to his judgement, he being so well aquainted with hydraulics. I have written to Brother McAllister and Brother Thompson upon this subject. I am glad you and your family are getting better. I had a very severe attack two days ago which lasted several hours, but through ad-ministering, etc. I was delivered. I feel al^l^right to-day. My family are generally well. We are preparing for Conference; we expect a large company of people. A good share of the Quorum of the Twelve will be with us; and I hope we shall have a profitable time.Of course you know our city is in the hands of the Gentiles, and of course they will take advantage of us in every respect they can; but we have to trust in God. As I am very busy to-day I can only write a short letter. Remember me kindly to your family and inquiring friends. God bless you all.Your Brother in the Gospel,W Woodruff

I have just returned from a journey of two weeks in the mountains. I came home almost acripple, having broken a blood vessel in my right leg, which lames me for the time being.Now concerning our waterworks. It seems that there has been quite amistake in the expectation of that piping. I have heard nothing at all from Brother McAllister on the subject. I do not know yet what will pbe done in the matter.My family are as well as usual. I had Emma, Blanche and Owen with mein the mountains. We spent our time in camp; did considerable fishing in theWeber river; caught some 200 trout. I did not catch a great many myself, because it was too hard work to follow the stream. Owen scared up a very large panther, and shot at and hit him with bird shot, But, of course, that is all the good it did, so far as stopping him was concerned. He represented him as a very largeanimal. We got a few chickens, which was all the game we secured, ecxcepting killinghalf a dozen porcupines.Brothers Wells and Farnsworhth were in this morning from Manti, but being busy with other parties I did not speak to them. I expect they will call again.Remember me kindly to Sister Atkin and all the family.As ever, Your BrotherW. Woodruff

 2speaking, a dependency or ward of the United States; but in a State capacity wewould be freed from such dependency, and would posses the powers and independence of a Sovereign State, with autorithy to make and execute our own laws. And beingsuch, we would, in the event of the disruption of the general goverment, beindependent of all earthly powers and clothed with legal as well as divineauthority to assume the possition in the earth of God has designed or may design us to fill in such an event. As Statehood seems to promise the readiest solution of some of the prominent questions involved in the great problem of the hour, and no other way  has as yet been manifested, it would seem proper for us to bend our faith and energies in that direction, that, if it shoul prove to be the will ofthe Lord, we may be found striving for that object; and should it not prove to bethe will of the Lord for us to get a State goverment, then would be justified in that we acted according to the best light and wisdom we possessed. And in conclusion upon this point, I may add that if it be the will of the Lord thatUtah should become a State, "all hell will be powerless to hinder it," just as you say, and certainy we should be found in accord with God's will. It is proper that we should strive to accomplish His purposes, always acting upon the best light we possess.I am glad to hear that little Nellie was preserved through her sore

Though thousands of miles of land water seperate us, for a cause not to gratify any selfish desire of my own but to bear glad tidings to the children of men, my thoughts wander back to the warmbreath of living Parents and I am with, ^you^ if not in body yet in spirit.This is the third time your Birthday has come and gone; or indeed the fourth sfoince I met with you for this occasion.Oh how good it would seem to be with you tonight! what joy would my heart feel to spend this quiet evening in the family circle of Home. Still I would not complain as God has been so merciful to ^you^ and spared your

I.The visitation of such a heavy snow storm, at the season of the yearyou wrote, is rather an unusual occurence for "Dixie," but none the less welcome tothe farmer and owner of stock. Our winter has been open and dry. We are threat-ened with another dry season, which will be srerious for the farmers, as the two or three past seasons have also been very dry. We have just had some verynice gentle rains, which have moistened the ground and will be a great help to plowing and seeding.It looks now, in view of the constantly increasing labors devolving uponme, as though I would not get an opportunity very soon of again disturbing thefish and game of the pond, as in days past; but in that regard my inability ordisappointment will be their pleasure, no doubt.Doubtless, the decision of the Supreme Court, for wich we are looking hourly, will be a "mixture of good and bad." But we shall rejoice if any good shall come to us out of thatrpolitico-judicial Nazareth. We will thank the Lordfor any right that may be vouschsafed to us, and for all favors we will praise Him,

H.Lund home but do not have any idea when he will return to good,old America or when I will get my release. There is going to be a great fair here in Berlin which will in many ways almost equal the Chicago Fair; it commences on the 1st  of may, I would like to get a glimpse

Wilford WoodruffMy Dearest Father:You will no doubt have though me a very ungreatfull son before this; as I have not answered your kind favor of the 5th together with Ovando's of Mch. 3rd containing the money you sent me. It was indeed a great surprise to me and I fear you have done yourself an injustice in sending me the last ammount.Am truely thankfull to you and whatyou sent will see me off in great shape. Should have answered before but have been on the go all the time &I know if you do not hear from me very often now, we still have the hope of seing each other in the near future so you will please pardon my tardy letters. Am having quite a lovely time getting Bro. Wilkins off;he starts Monday and will sail on April 23rd from Glasgow. I will likely becoming along a few months later if our Prest gets through with me. Prest.Naegle has written me nothing definiteabout my release but has hinted at it. I am feeling fine in my work and 
 writing.President Cannon is in the east, working for our cause against thepowerful agencies now operating for the defilement of Zion. Surely Satan has greatpower and his struggles are desperate, knowing his time is short. But the Kingdomof God will prevail and eventually triumph gloriously. Brother J. F. S. is where Ican reach him when necessary, and although chafing somewhat in spirit at the con-dition of things, he is in no way visibly impaired by his long exilement.Your description of the Temple tank and explanation of the manner of itsconstruction are all I could wish, and the matter of your opinion in regard tothe capacity of the lower end of the pipe, I think, is worthy of due consideration.It might be well for you to explain your views fully to Pres. McAllister and BrotherThompson, and if they argree with you, let them bring the matter beofore us and wewill give it attention.With kind regards,Your Brother,W. Woodruff

Ihave never visited any part of Utah where there seemed more need of preaching thegood word than in Utah Co.

Toronto who has just finished a 31 month mission amongst the french-speaking people of Switzerland has been with me for about a week; he is on his way to Italy and perhaps to Cisily where he has relatives. I was indeed glad to see him and assist him in seeing Berlin. He has fulfilleda fine mission and rejoices in the good work he has been able to do. On returningto Salt Lake I have requested him to callon you; that is if he gets home before I do. It may be some months before he completes his tour but will no doubt call on you several months before I am permitted to do so.Cornelious has not yet arrived but I amlooking for him in a few day; whenhe comes and gets a little acquainted, I must go to Stettin and visit our Branchthere and then as soon as circumstances will permit shall go to to Soran and visitthe good saints who are left with out a shepherd on account of the persecution forbidding an Elder to remain there.

Of coursehave seen the Rhein but the Saintsin Frankfurt are very anxious for me to visit them again & it would be a great satisfaction for me to do so.It would not be nice to go homeuntill about the first of May anyway as  the ocean voyage, would not be as pleasant, By Jove it will be great to be tossed about on the white caps again and I am sure I shall enjoy my voyage this time.
