We are not teaching poligamy  or plural marriage nor permitting any person to  Enter into the practice and I deny that Either forty  or any other number of plural marriages have during  that Period been solemnized in our temples or in  any place in the territory. One case has been reportd in which the parties alleged that the marriage was perf- ormed in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City  in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able  to learn who performed the cerimony what Ever was done  in the matter was without my knowledge in consequence of this  alleged occurance the Endowment House was taken down by my instruction  without Delay Inasmuch as laws have been Enacted by congress forbidding  plural marriages which laws have been pronounced constitutional  by the court of the last resort. I hereby declare my intention to submit  to those laws and to use my influence with the members of the Church  over which I preside to have them do likewise There is nothing in my  teachings to the Church or those of my Associates during the time specified  which can reasonably be construed to inculcate or Encourage poligamy and  when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey such teaching he has been promptly reproved And I now publicly declair that  my advice to the Latter Day Saints is to refrain from contracting any  Marriage forbidden by the Law of the land Wilford Woodruff  president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints   ENDENTRY  at Lethbridge we put up at M giving day in Canada, all the stores &amp; business places were closed.
