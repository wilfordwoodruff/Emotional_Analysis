 step into the promised land forever." He said other  things in this vision that we cannot write you.  After this he said what we have told ^you^ in the  beginning of this letter. "I know the work is set  up; Truth is established; Hold fast to the Rock."  That Rock is Christ. Brethren, our hearts are too  full in writing this—words fail us—we can not  describe to you these things. We will close our  letter now, hoping the time is not far distant  when we can speak with you face to face,  and tell you what we have seen and heard.  We had thought to write you add more to this  letter by way of exorhortation to the brethren, but  we feel to close now. May we all so live, that  when we come to die, we may be as sure of the   first Resurection as ^our^ dear departed Bro. David  Whitmer. May the Holy Spirit of God be with  you all abundantly, to continue with you  all through life, is the prayer of your  unworthy brethren, in the name of our Lord  and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

 St. George, Utah.  29th Septr 1887.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,  Dear Brother,    Elder Robert C. Knell, son  of Bishop Robert Knell of Pinto Ward, in  St George Stake, by your notification, bearing  date 22nd Sept, has been called on a mission  to the Southern States.    We beg leave to represent that his father, Bp  Knell, desires if acceptable to the Lord, and to  yourself and the brethren, that the appoint-  ment be to England instead of the Southern  States.    By this means, to which Robert  C. willingly assents, the father thinks that  in addition to filling a mission his son can  gather up some family genealogy in Southamp-  ton, England and perhaps in some other places in that  Country. Robert C. is Bp Knell's only son.    If the change as asked, be made, please notify  us by telegram, and also, state time when English  missionaries leave Salt Lake City, and we

 Dear Br Woodruffe, Haverstraw Septr 4th 1855    Time passes swiftly away and   we have not reached the valley, I have no doubt   you have some times wondered where we have   got to, I some times am led to ask my self the   question.    Since you left the States things have   changed and still continue to change. I have   been foreman of the Engraveing Shop here for   some years, but the continual fluctuations   in trade have kept us from saveing much   money yet we have saved a little, and expect   before long to gather up my family and flock   into the valley of the Mountains. I have continued   to meet with the saints; and have Baptised   about a dozen includeing two of my daughter   we meet twice a week for sacrament and   fellowship meetings, we enjoy a goodly portion   of the spirit of God, and his power is ma-  nifest in various ways. We have received   visits from Brs Walker Armstrong, J D Ross  ^Br^ Treat, Richard Cook, Br Robins, Taylor, and   Felt and lastly Br Edward Perk the bearer   of this note. I have enjoyed myself in the   society of all those who brought with them   the spirit of Truth. I frequently have made   enquiries about you and sister Woodruff   and anticipate the day being not far distant   when I shall behold you again in the flesh    I wonder if sister Woodruff reserved a lot   for us, as we asked her to do next to you   when we anticipated coming the next season   never mind I expect there yet is room in

I received a note from  the First seven Presidents of Seventies dated Aug 31st 1887. asking how  I was fixed financially and how I felt concerning the perfor-  mance of a mission. I replied, with the endorsement of Bishop F. Kesler  and President Angus M. Cannon, to the effect, that I had a wife  and two children depending on me for support. I have a  home I call my own, but I am oweing several hundred  dollars on it, about $400 before it is free, and my own  in fact. I am now in the employ of J W Summerhays & Co. I  have no source of revenue only the labor of my  hands. I do not wish you to think that I am  trying to excuse myself from going, but these are  my circumstances.

The eyes  then gradually turned straight up toward  heaven, and he seemed to be looking at some-  thing way afar off. He was looking into heaven!  Then a sweet smile came upon his whole  face and features, as if he was greeting the  angels of God. He breathed one or two more  times, and his body sank in death.

On the 4 inst.  while teaching school at Brigham City, I re-  ceived a letter from you, calling me on a mission  to the North Western States, and requesting me to  to be prepared to start on Apr. 24.

I had commenced to make preparations for  this mission, but on arriving at home yesterday  I was greatly surprised ^to^ find awaiting me a letter  from you, appointing me to a mission in New  Zealand. As no explanation was given, I do not know  whether there is some mistake or whether you have  seen fit to make this change.    In reply to the last call, I am sorry to say  that my circumstances will not permit me to comply,  as I am not able to raise the means requisite to

Dear brother, iIn the  Midst of all the ups and downs that we as a people  are called upon to pass through in this lower  world, I still feel it a Jjoy and Satisfaction to  Celebrate the 24th of July, our old pioneer day.  and iIn looking over the Deseret News Editorial ^matter^,  from mondays daily ^of^ July 23 1888. I feel flattered  with the Eulogy therein contained, not particularly  ^on account of the^ praise to those ^alone^ who waere alone pioneers, for they  in reallity could not do any different, Bbut praise  to God, our heavenly Father, who pioneeered us  here. aAlthough I was not numbered among they  143 who came as that noble band, But I was with  you nearly all the way from Green River, and only  Stayed back to let the presidant's company keep  on the lead. yYou remember coming out on the  East bBench to meet the Battallion Detachment,  under Captain James Brown. I was then one of  the Boys, and I immediately went to work  making adobies, and layeing them up into athe  fFort wall of what was called the oOld Fort, of  which I believe I built about one half with  my own hands. and I know I built the  first cChimney that Ever drew Smoke in these  valleys. ^It was^ for Presidaent Brigham Young, in a  log house on the East Side of the Fort; and as  it is comforting to recount the Reminescences of    (over)

 thereThere are many of my old pioneer & Soldier Breathren  that I remember with pleasure, and as the Deseret  news says, will be remembered with pleasure in  after generations, as their valor and integrity is not  at present fully appreciated, but postery will do them  Jjustice. I can rejoice to learn of the increse of our people  and ^the^ Spread of truth. that Whereas, on the 24th of July,  1847, there wasere 143 pioneers and 150 Battallion boys, and  some 20 of our Sisters who are mothers in Isreal, also  a few Missi^ssi^ppi Saints who wintered at Pueblo,  now ^in^ Colorado Territory, who waere the little Nulcleus  around which hasve Gathered so many thousands, and  have radiated ^spread^ around into other Territories, it  makes me think of a sum in multiplication in com-  pound numbers. If six will multiply in fifty-eight  years into 300,000 what will 300,000 multiply into   in the next 58 years if all were ^are^ faithfull in keeping  the Commandments of the Lord. Chi iIf Isreal had  only allowed themselves to have been governed by  good councilsel, where there ^are^ now a few Saints, there  would have been many. However Isreal is on  the increse, and will never be less, and the little  affliction wherewith we are afflicted is mearly a  Fatherly hint that we are not forgotten by him,  I thank god all the time that we are not allowed  to run wild lik sheep without a Sheapherd,  and I hope the time is not far distant when we will  see our aAppostles and leading Breathren among us once more.

 unto those who have not a know-  ledge of the Gospel of peace.    I would add, a few  words concerning Brother  Riche's health—he is a great  sufferer being afflicted with   the bleeding piles in a very   severe manner, so much   so; that after stooling it re-  quires about half an hour  before he can walk—excepting   nature is imposed upon ^in which case^ and  severe pain follows.    During brother Riches last   mission to England, he was obliged  to take his bed several times on  account of severe attacks of the  piles which was agrevated by  to much walking. The disease   is cronic with him having   been troubled with it for about  8 years    Brothur Rich is willing to  go and expresses his determination   to do as you think best.    It would seem to me  a very unwise thing for a   man in bro' Riches condition   to go abroad but, I feel sure   if you think proper to say  to him to go that it will all  trurn out for good, after you  are made acquainted with his  true condition.

I am a Jew by birth, and became identified  with the Principles of Mormonism about three  years ago. Soon after my baptism in New  York City by bro. Jas. H. Hart I came out to  Salt Lake. I was employed by Bro. C. R. Savage  for a short time, and at the Deseret News office  for about Eighteen months, and lately I have been  canvassing and collecting for L. Stenhouse, Publisher  of Utah Gazetteer.    I learned that Dr. Isaacson one of my  Jewish brethren has Joined the church, and is  engaged in translating the book of Mormon in  the Jewish language. I had the pleasure of  becoming aquainted with him and found him  to be a cordial gentleman and a scholar.    Since I met him my faith has been strengthened  and I earnestly desire with all my heart to   help the building up the Church and Kindom

Dear Brother:    You  doubtless are awaiting a reply to your last letter  to me. I have heard of the letter, and have an  idea of its contents from my brother to whom it  was sent, in Salt Lake City; but I have not seen  it yet, as he forgot to bring it when he came out.    If I understand rightly you ask what is the  amount of my indebtedness, what interest I have  to pay, and also what aid my family will require  if I go to the Sandwich Islands and leave them.    If, when I receive your letter, I see anything else that  requires an answer, I will write again. My Father  will be in the city about the 3rd of Jan., and he will  try to see you, when he can give you all inform-  ation you may require. Were he not coming I would  try to come and see you my self.    During the month of Jan. I expect to take out a  loan of $600.00 from Zion's Benefit Building Society  to pay the amount due on my home in the 17th Ward  besides this I will ^be^ owing $150.00. The dues and interest  on the former, amount to $7.00 per month, and  the interest on the latter to $12.00 per annum, or a  total of $8.00 per month. The County, Territorial, and  City taxes amount to $17.00 per annum, making  a grand total of $113.00 per year.

 ability. I desire with all my heart to magni-  fy the Holy Priesthood with which I have been   honored.    I regret to say, however, that my financial  condition is not such as is desirable—though  in the face of the history of Zion's Missionaries,  their sacrifices etc for the gospel it is not for  me even if I desired so to do, to say that it  forms an insuperable barrier to my going from   home whenever I may be called.    Allow me briefly to explain my position.    Three years ago when I came home from the Islands  I had nothing. I went to school one year, got  married the next year, and went to teaching,  being obliged to run in debt for a home, which  debt I hoped to be able to clear in about three  years from now. My income is about $70000 per  annum, realized entirely from my labors.    When I go my wife will be thrown on her own  resources for the support of herself and child  (we now have two children). At present I do not  see how she is to ^do^ this, nor how I am to raise money  to take me to the field of labor mentioned (in  summit Co. there is a missionary fund for this  purpose) Of course I realize that God can  provide. With a repeated assurance  that when the Lord calls I hope to be ever will-  ing, if not prepared, to respond and a prayer  that God may bless those who rule in Zion, and  all her interests, I subscribe myself—etc."    To the above the following answer was received:    "Elder Marvin E. Pack,    Dear Brother:    Your letter under  date of April 18th came to hand and was read  before the First Council of Seventies.    I am directed to inform you that you  are excused from taking a mission.    Salt Lake City    May 2, 1888.    Respectfully your Brother  Robert Campbell, Clerk"    On receiving this word I gave up  all idea of a mission for some time to come  and, therefore, I am not so free as I was then.    I made a contract with the trustees of Coal-  ville to teach the district school, and moved  my family out expecting to remain one year  (till June) at least. I have no doubt, however,  that the trustees would release me, if my ser-

Salt Lake City, Utah, April 9th 1888    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother—The writer of the  enclosed letter is a lady who spent several  weeks, about last Fall Conference time, visiting  our city. Herself and husband have traveled  quite extensively through Mexico. She stayed  at my house several weeks while here, and  she seemed quite conversant with the Spanish  language.    I submit her letter to you thinking per-  haps it may be of some use to the Church  should it feel inclined to colonize in that direction.  While here she seemed kindly disposed toward  our people and deprecated the action of our enemies.    With kind regards to yourself and those  associated with you and praying the Lord to  bless and preserve you for the interest and wel-  fare of His people, I am, as ever,    Your Bro. in the Gospel,  Milando Pratt. 
 If this were paid it would still require about  $3000 per month for the support of my family; and,  as they would have no income from any other source,  this is the amoung of aid they would require.    If it were thought advisable for my family to go  with me, the rent of our home would keep up the  interest on my indebtedness, taxes etc.    I am thus explicit because I believe it is your  desire to know just how I am situated. Notwithstand-  ing all, I believe I am in as good condition for go-  ing as I will be for the next three years, perhaps    As I said in my former letter I regret that  my financial condition seems to form any bar-  rier to my usefulness in assisting to forward the  Work of the Lord, and if the way be opened I am  ready to respond to the call, fully believing all will  be for the best.

 vices are wanted as a missionary.    In turning the matter over in my mind,  it has seemed to me the only way is for my  wife to go with me, if I go; and thus leave the  rent of the house to keep up the interest and the  taxes. With the assistance of the "Fund" established  in this Stake for sending off missionaries, and  by borrowing some we might be able to get ready.    tThese ideas have been suggested to me in trying to  see my way to go, and this seems the most feasaible  plan, though promising so little.    I trust what I have written may not appear  as though I am not willing to respond to the call.    I am perfectly willing, and my deepest regret  is that I am so situated financially that it  seems to form any barrier to my going.    In conclusion, I pray that the Spirit may dic-  tate what is best; and I shall anxiously await your  council as the prayed for guidance, and thank-  fully accept and abide ^by^ it with the most abiding  faith.

Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother:  Yesterday, I endorsed a  statement in relation to  circumstances of brother  S. C. Petersen, who had  been notified through the  Seventies' organization to hold  himself in readiness for a  mission.    Not wishing to  injure his feelings by giving  my opinion on the subject  at the time, I thought best  to take this course, and  inform you that he is  not suitable to represent  us among the nations, and  therefore would respectfully  recommend that he be 
 brought before Judge Zane, and  while before his honor yesterday  they were intimidated into giving  evidence which would crimi-  nate him. They are at present  at liberty and not under bonds    He and his dear wives are in  great distress and he with others  to whom I have spoken are in-  clined to go to Mexico: but he  dont know what to do; he does  not like to act without counsel  and will not do so. He desired me  to seek it from you. He is will-  ing to do anything in his power  for the cause in which we are en-  gaged and for his family; and  it would almost kill them to  see him cast into prison. To stay  here seems to be nothing less than  to break up his once happy family  and to impoverish them. If we could    [upside-down text]   see you and speak to you it would do   our hearts good.

 Hanisch, Richard    Translations in Polish    Salt Lake City, August 15th 1888.    President Wilford Woodruff, Esq.  Salt Lake City.    My dear brother:    If agreeable to you, I should  like to translate the Book of Mormon or any other  Church works you may see proper at first into the  Polish language and later into Russian. Since so  many Polish people live in the United States—Even at the  present time, in Rochester N. Y., there is a contemplation to build  a new Roman Catholic Church for Polish people, there are  already two in Buffalo, N. Y., and many Polish Churches in  Chicago, and besides a large Newspaper is in circulation  in the Polish language there—and since for the  benefit of Eastern Europe, namely in Poland and  Russia little or perhaps nothing has been done,  I put this matter before you for your consideration,  and would be very happy, if an opportunity  should be given to me to work for the benefit  of the Church in any way, you think best.  My oldest son, Richard, who has studied for  five years, and who will finish his education 
 letter, which explains itself.    Yesterday I had a conversation  with Bro. Thomas, and explained  to him frankly & fully, my  circumstances financially, and  the difficulties I had met with in   publishing the 1st Edition of the work,   when to my great supprise he  proffered to assist me, without hope of  earthly reward, in Publishing an Edn  of 1,000 copies, or to advance to Russell  Bros. $500.00 as a starter, & the use of  his name for the printing, desiring  simply that the moneys derived from  the sale of the books, should be paid over  to him on a/c, till the debt is settled:  providing however, that his action in  the matter should meet with the sanction  of the Presidency of the Church, and providing  also that we could have not only your sanction &  blessing, but the moral aid and support of the  authorities, & of the Deseret News & Juvenile Inst-  ructor. In case the enterprise should  meet with your approval, we shall  be very glad to receive from you a line  or two by way of incouragement.    Your Bro in the gGospel,  P. P. Pratt

Bro Campbell said  if my name was handed to   the twelve appostles he would  notify me in regard to going  on a mission, but he did  not do it so that I am  rather embarrased in regard  to my financial condition,  I am under obligations for  machinery since my first  letter as not being notified

I would have preferred  to go to England as I have  so many relations there, and  so many Enlglish people here  that I think it would be easier  to get means for traveling.  As I said in my previous   letter my feelings was to go  when called upon, if I had  no financial obligation.

Wilford Woodruff    Dear Bro-    You will pardon me for  trespassing upon your time, but appreciating  your former personal friendship and wishing  to obtain from you an endorsement of my action  I write you. For a number of years I have  been suffering from scrotal hernia. It has grown  worse, until it has reached that condition that  I cannot move about much without great pain,  and it has become necessary that I do something  by way of treatment. In order to raise the  means, I have prepared a lecture entitled  "Which shall it be, the philosophy of Christ or the  Sophistry of the infidel? It is prepared for  the especial purpose of meeting the arguments  of Robt G. Ingersoll, which I learn are becoming  more or less popular with some of our young peo-  ple. I have delivered the lecture here in Ogden,  and it receivd the endorsement of Pres. Shurtliff and  others. I have been requested to repeat it.    If you wish it, I would be pleased to submit  a reading of it to you at your convenience.

As to the qualifications for the position  you speak of I must say that I  have but a comon education and am  far from being perfect in the german  language, yet, when laboring in that  mission under Bishp. Jos S. Horne  in 1876–78 I was called to do the  same work, knowing my inability  I made it a matter of prayer and  by the blessings of God and much  study I was inabled to do my duty.  In conclusion I will say, that I am  willing to go or to come as God and His  Servants feel to direct, and family or  finances are no consideration when  duty calls having a testimony of the  truth of the Gospel I desire to joyfully  labore in the cause of truth as long as  God will aid and asist me.

Awaiting an early reply I remain your Brother in   the Gospel of Christ    William Bench.    P.S. I have adopted the name of W. S.

 Budge, Wm    Paris Idaho  December 26th 1888.    President W. Woodruff    Dear Bro    Elder Olavus Jacobson of Randolph  Ward in this Stake has been notified by you in a letter  dated Dec 10th that he has been accepted as a Missionary  to Norway. Bro Jacobson is is^a^ councillor to his Bishop—  A. Mckinnon who left home on Friday last for Ogden  to receive sentence for living with his wives. I have  not yet learned what his sentence has been, or how  long he may be gone, but even when at home he needs  the help of Bro Jacobson who is a very active and  usefull man in the ward. In the absense of Bishop  McKinnon the labors of Bro Jacobson will be of course  much more necessary here.    Elder Jacobson is a good man and quite willing  to respond to any call, but I feel it to be my duty  under the circumstances to accquaint you with  the foregoing consideration, as I am anxious to keep  our local organizations as complete and effective  as possable. With complements of the Season    I remain very truly  Your Bro  Wm Budge 
 Paris, Idaho  Nov Oct 7th 1887    President W Woodruff    Dear Bro    Bro E. L Burgoyne of Montpelier  called upon me yesterday, and desired me to write to you   in relation to himself and the mission to which he has  lately been called. He is an excellent young man, and  anxious to go, but his Father upon whom he has been  depending for his living thinks he cannot possably spare  him untill spring, as the young man has had the  care of stock and other interests that the father is not  familiar with. Bro Burgoyne—the father—is one of our  leading business men and although in his feelings and  sympathies he is with the church, does not live up to  his privileges in meny things, or he would make the  way open for his son to go, he promised however to let  him go in the spring. They had a rather serious altercation  over the matter yesterday morning, the Boy having it seems  sdeclared his intention to go anyway, but I told him  I would write to you, and perhaps you would think  it best for him to satay till spring and go with his  fathers good feelengs. A word from you addressed to  me on the subject at your earliest convenience will  much oblige    I remain  very respectfully  Your Bro  Wm Budge
