I have been foreman of the Engraveing Shop here for some years, but the continual fluctuations in trade have kept us from saveing much money yet we have saved a little, and expect before long to gather up my family and flock into the valley of the Mountains. I have continued to meet with the saints; and have Baptised about a dozen includeing two of my daughter we meet twice a week for sacrament and fellowship meetings, we enjoy a goodly portion of the spirit of God, and his power is ma-nifest in various ways. We have received visits from Brs Walker Armstrong, J D Ross^Br^ Treat, Richard Cook, Br Robins, Taylor, and Felt and lastly Br Edward Perk the bearer of this note. I have enjoyed myself in the society of all those who brought with them the spirit of Truth. I frequently have made enquiries about you and sister Woodruff and anticipate the day being not far distant when I shall behold you again in the fleshI wonder if sister Woodruff reserved a lot for us, as we asked her to do next to you when we anticipated coming the next season never mind I expect there yet is room in

Soon after my baptism in NewYork City by bro. Jas. H. Hart I came out toSalt Lake. I was employed by Bro. C. R. Savagefor a short time, and at the Deseret News officefor about Eighteen months, and lately I have beencanvassing and collecting for L. Stenhouse, Publisherof Utah Gazetteer.I learned that Dr. Isaacson one of myJewish brethren has Joined the church, and isengaged in translating the book of Mormon inthe Jewish language. I had the pleasure ofbecoming aquainted with him and found himto be a cordial gentleman and a scholar.Since I met him my faith has been strengthenedand I earnestly desire with all my heart to help the building up the Church and Kindom

 ability. I desire with all my heart to magni-fy the Holy Priesthood with which I have been honored.I regret to say, however, that my financialcondition is not such as is desirable—thoughin the face of the history of Zion's Missionaries,their sacrifices etc for the gospel it is not forme even if I desired so to do, to say that itforms an insuperable barrier to my going from home whenever I may be called.Allow me briefly to explain my position.Three years ago when I came home from the IslandsI had nothing. I went to school one year, gotmarried the next year, and went to teaching,being obliged to run in debt for a home, whichdebt I hoped to be able to clear in about threeyears from now. My income is about $70000 perannum, realized entirely from my labors.When I go my wife will be thrown on her ownresources for the support of herself and child(we now have two children). At present I do notsee how she is to ^do^ this, nor how I am to raise moneyto take me to the field of labor mentioned (insummit Co. there is a missionary fund for thispurpose) Of course I realize that God canprovide. With a repeated assurancethat when the Lord calls I hope to be ever will-ing, if not prepared, to respond and a prayerthat God may bless those who rule in Zion, andall her interests, I subscribe myself—etc."To the above the following answer was received:"Elder Marvin E.

 If this were paid it would still require about$3000 per month for the support of my family; and,as they would have no income from any other source,this is the amoung of aid they would require.If it were thought advisable for my family to gowith me, the rent of our home would keep up theinterest on my indebtedness, taxes etc.I am thus explicit because I believe it is yourdesire to know just how I am situated.

 vices are wanted as a missionary.In turning the matter over in my mind,it has seemed to me the only way is for mywife to go with me, if I go; and thus leave therent of the house to keep up the interest and thetaxes. With the assistance of the "Fund" establishedin this Stake for sending off missionaries, andby borrowing some we might be able to get ready.tThese ideas have been suggested to me in trying tosee my way to go, and this seems the most feasaibleplan, though promising so little.I trust what I have written may not appearas though I am not willing to respond to the call.I am perfectly willing, and my deepest regretis that I am so situated financially that itseems to form any barrier to my going.In conclusion, I pray that the Spirit may dic-tate what is best; and I shall anxiously await yourcouncil as the prayed for guidance, and thank-fully accept and abide ^by^ it with the most abidingfaith.Respectfully, Your BrotherMarvin E.
