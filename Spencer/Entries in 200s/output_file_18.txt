 House of Representatives  Washington. D.C. Feb 27/61    Wilford Woodruff Esqr  G.S.L. City. Utah Territory.  Dear Bro,    Your much Esteemed favor  of the 24th ulto duly reached me, and it afforded me pleasure  to learn of the prosperity attending. the inhabitants of our  beloved Territory, also the peaceable time Experienced during  the Winter. The reverse however, has characterized the movements  of the people by whom I am surrounded, the most intense  anxiety, and Excitement prevailing ever since my  arrival here. I have however strove to attend to the  interests of my constituents, and kept aloof as much  as possible from participating in any political squabbles.  I may say, I have been treated by all parties during this  Session, with respect, and in many instances marked courtesy,  and thro' a variety of ways, my acquaintance among men  of all classes is pretty Extensive, and tends to help me  along materially in the discharge of my onerous duties.    I shall write Prest Young on Saturday by Pony with  the news, and as you will receive the same before this reaches  you, it will be useless to advert at length now, to the political  movements, indeed, things are in some respects at a stand still,  all eyes are turned to the Prest Elect – to solve the problem 
 was to leave For Frederickton which I had to take in an hour aftr   I got in the city so I had but little time to see St Johns. I fou[n]d the place   had part of it been burned & the rest of it was in great excitemet in   consequence of a row they had a day or two before I got there A company of   Orangemen marched in p[r]ossessi[o]n the Catholics stoned & [illegible]  them they then armed theirselves & fought with pistols guns swords   &c & 15 or 20 were killed & many wounded. I visited the place of the  acc^t^ions & from the ball & shot Holes in the windows doors & Homes  I wonder that many more were not killed it is supposed it will   be renewed. I took steemer & rode to Frederickton 100 miles up the St John  River arived at 8 oclok I was still very lame & sore with my walking. I f[o]u[n]d   the country both sides of the St Johns River the most beautiful   farming country almost that I ever saw for so long a distance in so  rough a country as the general face back in in the timber lands  appears. I put at ^up^ at the Temperance Hotel in York Street. A stranger in a stra[n]ge  country. It rained most of the way up the river yet I stayed most   of the time on deck to view the country & to see the Salmon & Sturgeon   jump out of water.    18th I learned this morning that I could not   leave for Miramichi for 3 days, but musst remain there. O How Horrible  to be shut up 3 or 4 days in a town for the wa[n]t of conveyance it is not so   in the States. I found Frederickton a very beatiful Location upon the Bank of the  river ground lever^l^ but all the streets runing through it to the west in a   strait line terminated a mile from the city on the top of a High Moutain  with a gradual risse. After examineing the city a little I went to the   Post Maste[r]s to see if I could get any New York papers He told me   the ownly Man in the city who took the New York Journal of Commerce  was the Hon Mr Partlow Member of Parliament. I asked him wha[r]e He   lived, for I was determined to Have the paperss. He told me. I called upon   the Hon Gentlemen. He treated me with all politeness loaned the pape[r]s   to me each day as they came in up to the Hour I left from them   I got much News from the States. Learned that in 10 weeks the deaths  in St Louis am[o]unted to 4321 in a pop of 45,000 that July 10th their was 190   burials there. I read the New York papers up to the 12th which I was  glad to get to pass away my time I attended a presbyterian meeting  at night. the most was done was to sprnkle a litle water in a Babys back   & called it Baptized which was solemn mockery befoe God 
 rather see Nauoo burned to the ground than to see  or hear of Brigham Young being martered by the   Carthage mob as Joseph & Hiram has been   & I would rathr they would have lived if the  city was lost, if it had been the will of God, for  we could build another city [illegible] than we could bring  them from their graves to take up their abode with us  I feel more & more the importance of the responsibility resting  upon us as Apostle of Jesus Christ identified with  the beginning of the rising & lifting up of Zion in this  last dispensation & preperation for the reign of Christ  on Earth when it is delvered from the dominion  of wicked men, sin & the devil. And my daily prayer  to God is that we may all live to accomplish the work  assigned us with honor to our calling & our God.    I wish to inform you that I sent to London  according to your request for a copy of the Entry  of the Book of Mormon and Lo and Behod No such   Entry could be found upon the Records at the Stationers  Hall in London I felt somwhat surprised at  this for Elder Heber C. Kimball with myself  Entered the work at least we presnted 5 copies of the 
 of the Book of Mormon to the clerk at the Statione[r]s  Hall & paid 3/ shillings sterling for Entering on the  Eight day of Feburary AD 1841 this is what both my  Journals & memory say. It was Entered in the  Name of Joseph Smith But Elder Davis stated  that He searched the Lettr Befor Book of mormon  & for Joseph Smith from 1838 to 45 & no such  Entry could be found. Their has been some trickery  in this it appea[r]s the clerk kept both the Books &  money without Entering it, & I am glad it has come  to light. No the question arises what shall be done  I think I should  now be Entered in your name  as president of the Church. But I will here remark  that I have had an interview with the American Consul  within a few days & showed him my power of Attorney  with the idea of learning whether I could act legally  upon it if it ever came to a court of Law. He info[rm]ed  me I could not that for it to be legal in a court  of Law in this county, it must Have the name  of the British Consul who is in America attached  to it And if it was a power of Attorney for England  to America it must Have the signature of the

 as to whether we are to have peace, or war, a few days however  will tend to relieve the present suspense. It is stated that   A Lincoln will act very Conservative, and hopes are En-  tertained – that by his persuing a conservative course, and  securing around him Men of like feeling, that the Border  Slave states will be retained in the Union. Those states  that have Seceded will it is presumed remain out. you are  of course aware, that they have organized an independent  Govt, adopted a Constitution, and Elected Jefferson Davis  Prest, and A. H. Stephens Vice Prest. Mr Davis in  his inaugural address at Montgomery, Ala. has stated,  that the day for Compromise, or reconstruction has past.    Prest Lincoln visited the Senate on Monday last, while  there, I was introduced to him by Senator Trumbull, of Illinois,  —as an old resident of Illinois—well, and favorably known,  and now the Delegate from Utah.    I presume before this  reaches, you will have learned that the Utah War debt  has passed the Senate, and now only waits for the signature  of the Prest to the Bill, to become a law. I need hardly  say, that it has taken no little amunt of labor, and wire  pulling, on my part, to get it thro'.    As you observe, I  have presented the Memorial of my Constituents for the  Admission of 'Deseret' as a State into the Union, but  I presume from the intimations I have received from the Members  of the Territorial Committee, to whom the Memorial was referred, 
 20th I took passage at 11 oclok to day in a thing they call a stage to ride n^i^ght  & day 100 miles to Miramichi through the forest. I will describe the stage  one pairs of Horses was put onto the tongue of an open lumber Waggon  with two seats in it the 1st seat was occupied by the drivers & Mr  Frazier with their feet on the Mail Bag. I occupied the 2nd seat above  making a driver & two passengers the Bottom of the Box ran out behind  the waggon 4 feet upon which stood a large Heavy chest. next was  another waggon with the long run under the first waggon & fastened  to it with ropes the se[c]ond waggon was loaded with wood  & trunks And with this train of two waggons & lumber hitched behind two Horses we  started to travel all day & all night through a forest country vary Hilly for 100 miles  And when I herd the driver tell about getting through in 24 Hours I thought  it would be more likely to take a week for I did not see how He was going to go out  of a walk with such a train of cars behind him But I was soon undecieved & my eyes  were opened for it was very Hilly & long Hills in many places & as soon as He came  to the top of a steep Hill, His Horses could not Hold the two waggons if they fell  ever so much disposed to so of course the ownly way was to run fast enough to keep out  of the way of the waggons so by the time I had rode down a few long Hills with the  Horses upon A keen run which speed they would not break untill they reach halfway  to the top of the next Hill. I began to think to we should soon get through our journey  but I thought it much more likely to end at the bottom of some tremendious  precipice or off a bridge in some brook which were vary freequant on the road, th[wax seal]  to End in Miramichi & that to before the light of anoth day. And in this way [wax seal]  we went dashing down Hills, through gullies, & over bridges He Ho [H]e ho like unt^i^lll midnight  21st l oclok in the Morning changed Horses, took tea, got in waggon. A fresh pair of Horses  put into A run, down Hills, with two waggons at their Heels, the driver & his companion  both sound asleep dark night, cannot see the road, Nothing but God or Angels can guide  us. Horses go whare they please, & probably it is better for the driver to be asleep than awake  for they may keep the road. My wife need never to call me an unlucky man if I ever live to  see day light again. Phebe would you not like to take a ride with me what an interesting Journey  I am Having. I am telling the truth just as it is we rode all night long in this way to broad  day light & down evry Hill from 10 rods to quarter of a mile long the Horses would go upon  a run & the drivers & Frazier slept for two hours after day light for which I was glad  to see. we came near being dashed to atoms runing down a Hill after day light. I could  not tell so much about the danger in the night but this child did not sleep untill After day light  I then caught myself noding a few times but they were short naps. I Arived At Capt Joseph  Russells at ll oclock And was glad to leave the stage & find myself alive I called upon Br Russell  And we had A Happy Meeting Br & sister Russell were both glad to se me I felt tierd out with riding  & excitement. I went to bed & slept to Hard    22nd Sunday I arose quite unwell.

 Tunstall April 12th 1841    Eldr G A Smith & Woodruff    Dear Bros    I take pen to inform you of some of the occ-  urances that have happened since you left us A spirit  of increased active exertion begins to manifest itself  among the officers of the Church in these districts All  are or at least seam to be considering the best ways of  of applying their exertions laying out schemes for the  carrying forth of the fullness of the Everlasting Gospel  into the Hamlets Villages &c so thickly scattered over this  tract of country. purporting to carry the same into greater  exertion as soon as the we^a^ther grows somewhat warmer  saying "well storm their camps this summer" and make  them that if they will not received this Gospel that at  least they shall not hardly dare to deny it's Truth" The  Lord hath graciously pleased to cause more confidence  and Faith to rest among ^us^ together with more unity or at  least I can say this is the case with myself & speak  from what I observe among my Brethren. The cry has  been now these Mericans [Americans] are going it will all fall to nothing  but these are not my expectations & I believe not my Brens  But among this their has been disagreeable cases that  have lately occured one of which was before the council  on the 10 th concerning separating the terms Christ & Jesus  makeing the divine to be Christ and the human Jesus the  hearing of this subject took some time but was ultimately  concluded ^carried^ by the officers that this subject be dropped entirely  or at least that no attempts be made to separate the two terms  in the way before mentioned there has^v^e been several ordinations  to the differant offices and under the hands of Messrs Cordon & Simpson  also a number of baptisms (upwards of thirty) since you left  and the work seems progressing stedily in great power &  is true that is and allways will be untill the Church be  perfect some efforts and every week part watched in  order to make some divission and seems Dear Bro[s] as  this would prove to be but the beginging of such things 
 Scarborough April 18th 1841    My Dear Companion    I sit down at fathers this afternoon  in the little chamber that you used to write in so much when here,   to acknowledge the reception of your kind letter dated London Feb. 18th  it was really comforting and cheering to my feelings [illegible] yes it brought   th me the most pleasing news that I have had since you left me—even   of your health and prosperity and also that you feell that your work is   done in that land your testimony finished and that you can depart  in peace—this is glorious news to me yes it is what I have often   looked forward to and longed for. I did not wish you to leave there   one hour sooner than it was the will of God for you to,—but I greately   rejoice with you at the prospect of your jubilee for release from your ar-  duous mission and if the Lord will be pleased to return you home   once more in safety and permit us to enjoy each other's society once  more we shall have great reason for thankfulness—that is what I have  greately ^&^ long desired.    Your long letter dated Jan. 10 was so long on the   way that I thought an lett answer to it would not reach you in Eng.   therefore wrote one and sent it to N.Y. in the care of brother Ilus for   you and as Mr. F.

I want a favor of you when you get whae Br  H Brown lives I want you to get some odd No of the  Old Messenger & advocate that he has on hand, get the  11 & 12 No's of the 2nd vol, and as many numbers of the third 3rd vol  as you can get. I have got all the first vol & to the 10th of the 2nd  but lack most all of the 3rd vol & as I dont know the odd No  lacking of the 3rd vol if you should make out the whole of  the 3rd vol it would  not do any hurt & I will make it right with  Br Brown    W. Woodruff    Br Smith I am now in Detroit, have Been to the  post Office & not one letter for any body. I have Been  to see the man that Br Phelps sent the letter to about  the clocks He said he would go down to the warehouse  & see about it. Said the Box of clocks was shiped on  & supposed evry thing was sent, it was Nothing to him  asked nothing for storage, had paid several postage on letters  on the subject & would still see to it.    Their is no meeting to night in Detroit  could not get a Roof room. Their is no boat in, that is the  opposition is not in & ^if^ they dont come I shall have to pay full fare  ie $3 Deck, $7 cabins this will be about my luck the opposition  has broake dow[n] & it is enough to break anything down for me to wa[n]t  a passage. I dont expect to go out to night at all.    good By May the Lord Bless you    W. Woodruff 
 and it will require dilligence & Faith & Prayer to  make some things bend in a suitable manmer and indeed  did I not behold such things how should conclude it  the church of Christ.

The  more I persevere in this work for dillegence makes rich  more I am convinced that it is the power of God and the  dispensation of the fullness of times in which Jeruslalem  shall again rise in beauty and Zions foundations again  be laid with fair colours may the Lord hasten this  in his time I have & continue to see more of the beauty of  the Kingdon organizeing in these last days & to feel more of  the spirit thereof resting upon me & I rejoice in the blessings  thereof & from testamony & judge my brethren are doing  the same the blessings of heaven being poured upon them  and Tongues Interpretations Revelations Visions &cc be given  unto them of the last I relate one case Br D Bowers the  last week (according to what he says) saw the glory of the Lord  & immediately afterwards a person in black rainent stood  before him & spoke to him in tongues.

I rejoice much  at the Choice glorious news I hear concerning  Zion by all the letters, & papers I get from the  goodly land of Joseph. I at times feel a^i^t a great  sacrafice to be deprived of ^the^ society of my friends in  that place & the choice Blessings Enjoyed in the City  of Joseph But the second thought teaches me that   obeded^i^ence is better than sacrafice & to hearken than the  fat of lambs, for I know it is necessary for  some one of the quorum to be in this land at the  present time & as the Lord & my Brother have  sent me heare I will be content & do the  best I can I know the Lord is with me & blesses  me abundantly if he did not I could not pass thrugh  the labours & responsibilities that are now resting  upon me. The work of the Lord is progressing well throughot  this Country considering the few experienced Elders we have  in this part of the vineyard the conferences are [most]  universally adding to their Numbers. I occasinally have to go  out into some of the conferences to settle some difficulty  that springs up But the Business of the Church  keeps me almost constantly at Liverpool at the  presnt time.

 My Dear son    As I have been giving Phebe some account  of our afflictions of late in regard to sickness, I wish to say a few words   to you in regard to our temporal affairs. — there seames to be in the  movement of things at the present time a kind of intimation that  your father will not stay long in this place. I will inform you  what I know for certainty but will firstly say that brother Woodruff  as you know has assisted your father heretofore by working in the shi-   ngle mille & he expected that he would also assist him the winter past &   also through the year—but before your father had time to call on him  he had made an engagement to work for a man at union through the year  your father was much disapointed & expressed his feelings to br. W. and he  said he did not think any thing about it his wanting him, this was s[page torn]  what strange but suffice it to say that Mr. Deming advertised for a  shingle sawer he received a letter from a man whom he thought would   answer their purpose—the other morn. when Br [Ulny] was here Mr. Came  came in & a gentleman with him after makeing some enquires about C. health  he says to me my object in comeing in was to let this gentleman look about the   house—being somewhat surprise I said why I supposed that the man that was  comeing here would have a house for his family elsewhere—well said Mr. C. I know  nothing about it only that Mr. Deming sent me here to let this gentleman see the  house & I not thinking of any thing more than haveing a family come in I   said Mr. C. you must think there are no conveniences for 2 families in this house  this he semed to assent to. I furthermore said that we were expecting our son this  spring from Eng & probably other friends & also that we were expecting the marriage   ceremony to be performed &c I told him I would wait on him about the house if he wished  but he declined—the next day your father said he more thought they were going to let   the whole establishment to him as he did not wish to take any part unless he could have the whole  we have heard nothing since on the same morn Mr. C. took your father aside and asked him if  he was tired tending the mill he said not this is all we know of the affair.   your father feels bad about it but we tell him it may all be for the best & we desire your counsil   upon it. 
 Great Salt Lake City April 30th/57.      Sister Jackson    I Recceved a Note from you of  March 7th which ought to have been answeed before this time  but the multiplicity of business has stood in my way of answering befoe  you say wherein you have Erred & gone astray you ask my forgiveness  In Reply I would say I feel to freely forgive you & all men  who have in any wise sined against me. I lay nothing up against you  but with Regard to Entering into the bonds of Matrimony I do not  feel prepared to take that step for we have had a long experence in  that & the past has fully shown that we have not Rendeed each   other happy, even after being seperated for years I agan provided   you with a home but our spirits for some cause were not  congenial & but a shor it was but a short time before you Requed [Requested]  me to give you a Bill of Divorce which I did do by the  advice of preidnt Youg, & you signed wishing Releasing me  from all further obligations. Our marriage has caused us both a  good Deal of unhappiness which has been felt throghout my whole  family. at Present I have peace & union with evry member of my  family. I would not wish to take any step to for they are all subjct  to me & all strive to abide my council & act for each others interest  & welfare & without this principle does exist & is carried out o^i^n my family  their will not be peace union or Happiness but the [Rel⬦⬦⬦] [Relief]  will be expernced. and I do not feel that is^t^ is wisdom to take  the steps which you sugget lest we should both be Rendered unhappy  instead of bettering our conditn. with Regard to James I will say I  am Ready at any time you please to take him & furnish him a home  & do as well as I can by him as soon as He is old Engh He

 Liverpool. Jan 13th 1845    President Young    Beloved Brother    I essteem it a pleasure  to spend a few moments in conversing with you by  letter. I have had rather of a slow journey from Nauvoo to  Liverpool but have arived at last. came into dock on the  4th inst had a rough voyage some heavy gales but got along  without any difficulty we were most of us sea sick a nu[m]ber  of days. we had a voyage of 25 days was 5 days in the Channel  But we are all well & lastly our babe is well & rugged. we have  been here but few days, & have hardly got settelled. I have  not yet been able to comprehend things at the Office but  as far as I know things have been conducted right. the  saints appear to have ^full^ confidence in Br Hadlock. I have  not had much time as yet with them, as they are very busy  fitting out a ship. As near as I can learn the work  is doing well through this country generally considering  the small number of American Elders in the Vineyard  the work is prosperous in London under the Labour of Eldr  Davis. Straten is doing well in the Lverpool conference &  Elder Holmes & Has gone to Manchester con & Hardy for a  little time Elder Sheets over Bradford con. As soon as  I understand & comprehend affairs at Liverpool I shall visit the  various conferences. their is I believe a universal feeling of  union in supporting the Twelve for they know no othr authority  neither do they wish to, as being over them. I shall write you  from time to time as I have matters of interest to communicate.  I have written to Elder Taylor upon one subject that I wish  you would try to put a stop to for the good of the cause

 Oct 29th    Brother W W Phelps    I Recved your kind letter under date   of Sept 15 the most of which you will find in the 10 No   of the star. I am truly glad to hear from you   or any of my friends often from Nauvoo during these  interesting times. And I hope even in the midst of the Endomnt  I shall not be forgotten by my frinds but hope some of  them will steal time enough to ocasenally drop me a few  lines. I have forwarded the Stars regular as they have  come out of press to Nauvoo to the Twelve & Editors of  the Times & Neighbor & I will Endeavor to forward the  punch & the Latest News for the Neighbor by each Steemer  But I supposed Eldr Hedlock & othrs were forwarding  papers for that purpose. But I will Endevor to attend to  it myself, you speaking of Having a multiplicity of  business to attend to I do not doubt it, in fact  as the Kingdom of God advances our cares & labous increase &  never saw the time when I had the same amont of labours &  car[e]s resting upon me as at the present time with so few  wise expernced men in this part of the vineyard the Burthn [Burden] of all the  churches rests upon me, scores of letters pouring in from all parts  of the kngdom, asking council & questions upon ^which^ every thing that the   [rightious] ever thought of from Abel to Joseph or that the wicked [men]  engaged in from Canin to Tom Sharp & I have to write ansers  & give council to these matters th[u]s with the matter for the  star, Temple Recording, Emegration, & a score of othr thngs keep  me so constantly Employed that my leasure hours are vary scarce  I felt vary anxious concering the movements of our Enemies in [illegible]  untill I got your lettr & G.

 After leaveing the Castle we took railway to  Birmingham whare we arived in the Evening we found  between four & five hundred Saints assembled in a large  Hall to what is called in England a tea meeting they  were all seated at the table when we Entered [illegible] on  arival as we Entered the door the clapinof^g^ of hands &  stomping of feet as [touting] of aplause made the house  tremble after feasting with them we addressed them ^the who[l]e Body^ for  about two hours & had a good time & spent sevral  hours with the officers we broak up at midnight, &  in the morning returned home. I have many  calls though the Kingdom to visit the churches but I  have but little time to go abroad at prsent. The work of  the Lord is taking a higher stand in this country than  it has done By means of servents & our Book it is  beginni[ng] to be investigated by some of the Nobility &  rig^c^h ones of the earth. I hope it will not be a great  while before some of them will begin to open their hearts to  begin to do sumthing for Israel. I Recieved the  proclamations a few days since of the Twelve Apostles to  the Kings Rulers & Nations of the earth. I shall do  what I can to circulate it in this co[u]ntry. I have some  20,000 in press in English & have sent word to Eldr   Jones to prepare to publish it in Welch as soon as  it is out of press here. I shall visit the Rabbies  in this place with the work & see if I can get them   to publish it in Hebrew.

 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation Psalm 95 Verse the 10th  I have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation ^Psalm 119 v 99^  When the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth? Luke chap 18 v 8th  To President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother On Sunday the 21st of December I was   visited by an Elder who told me that a proclaimation was comeing out and on the 11th of January  I visited a small company of Saints and obtained a copy of the same which since then I have   read with deep interest. On the 6th page you say no individual will stand neutral and this   I firmly believe and therefore I find it impossible to stand neutral[.] I cannot rest contented   without makeing some reply. Page 13 God has said that if the Gentiles do not repent and   come to the knowledge of the truth and cease to fight against Zion and also put away all   murder lying pride priestcraft whoredom and secret abomination they shall soon perish   from the earth and be cast down to hell. God hath also said that the time is at hand for   the Jews to be gathered to Jerusalem. On these two points of doctrine I feel desireous to speak.  If the Gentiles are ^to^ put away these evil practices they must have some body to preach to them   exactly in the same manner as Jesus Christ did preach when he first made his public   appearance among men: and thes the Gentiles have not had that I am aware of since the   3rd century. Let the 5th 6th and 7th chapters of Matthew be brought upon the carpet and   carefully examined[.] And let us see if his first and chiefest sermon contains any thing   calculated to give political and heathen Governments hope that they should have any thing   to do in establishing the kingdom of God. Let my brethren the Latter day Saints or as   many of them as are in Office join with me in preaching or publishing to the Gentile world   the laws of Jesus Christ in their literas [literal] sense and free from corruption and error   This I say hath not been the practice of the gentile cleargy in my time for if ^it^ had I must   have heard it at some time ^or^ other within the space of three score years.    Nothing is more evident to me than that it was the intention of Jesus to give and to leave with   his Church a sample of laws that should be soficient for their guidance in all ages if they  would receive and abide by them as they ought to do. To suppose that ^the^ moral precepts of Jesus Christ   as delivered in his sermon on the mountain is not soficient for all the moral purposes of   his disciples is to suppos a deficiency in the wisdom of God in sending Jesus Christ on   the errand he did send him. Those who make laws in oposition and contrary to the laws of Jesus   Christ and enforce them by the point of the bayonet while they call themselvs christians   virtueally says to their Maker "Thou art a fool thou dost not know so well as we do by what  Laws the people ought to be governed." Two of the petitions in the prayer which our Lord composed   for the use of his disciples are noticed in this proclaimation and I ask leave to notice another of  them. Forgive us our trespases (How and in what manner?) as we forgive them that trespas   against us[.] What are we not to be forgiven but upon this condition? Here the answer of Jesus   to this question. If ye forgive not men their trespases neither will your Father fo  He^a^venly Father forgive your trespases. This is intilligable language there is no quibbleing   [page torn] [i]n this doctrine. This sort of Prayer it is clear to me was taught by the saviour to prevent   or hinder his Saints from praying blasphemy. But how do I forgive those who trespas   against me if as soon as they have do^ne^ so I fly to ha heathen ^laws^ for shelter and revenge?  But what does such practice imply? It implys something to this efect namel[y] that Christianity   is a cheat played off upon the world and that it hath no foundation in truth. It gos to teach   that man knows better than God does what amount of chastisemen the wicked ought to receive   for their cruelty th to their fellow creatures—and also knows better when such chastisement   ought to be inflicted. The laws of Jesus Christ are a part of t^h^e law of God so highly extoled in the   Hundred and nineteenth psalm for they came to man from God through the same Jesus Christ  One of the laws that he delivered is as follows[:] What so ever ye would that men should do unto   you do ye also unto them. Here is an appeal to our reason and to the inward convictions of our own heart   If then our heart and our reason do testify that when we our selves do transgress the bounds of love   and actually trespas against our brother ^or^ sister as that perhaps we may for we are not perfect or not so   perfect as not to be liable to fall if I say our reason and our hearts do testify that in such a case we   would prefer punishment to forgiveness then indeed this last mentioned law of Jesus Christ will   allow people with this convi^c^tion to resist litteraly moral evil in other people    But I trust I have too much good sense about ^me^ to pretedd pretend to believe that such a man ex^i^steth   on the Globe. For if such a thing could be proved it would also prove that Christianity it[s]elf [page torn] is   nothing more than a jumble of absurdity confusion and self contradiction and Consequently   not worthy the attention of any reasonable man. 
 in this land viz that of the Elders Bringing letters in quantities  to this country which is involving us in much trouble expence  & difficulty as their is £5 pounds fine upon all letters either  sealed or unsealed brought to England except in Ship Bags  so any that bring letters should put them into the hands  of the captain, ((except it may be some private letters  to us can be sent by confidential friends can be brought  to us when they first come ashore)) see Elder Taylors letter.

If you see him please ask him to write  me a letter direct to 36 Chapel St Liverpool. I recieved a letter  from you in New York. In it you stated that the $50 was  to come out of the $500. I told Br Jones so & he seemed much  tried about it so much so that I did not endors it on the order  he says he left about $100 dollars of liabilities in some way  for that & that it was understood &c I told him it would  be all made right, when both come to understanding about  it. As to the order On Harden & Company the money was  never deposited with them. Elder Hedlock says in consequence  of paying some back debts & sending over so many without  pay the Office is some in debt. I shall understand the exact  situation of it as soon as I can. He wishes to send some  money for the Temple by this ship, so I took but £25 pounds  for Jones to start him with, which I endorsed on the order  the twenty five Pounds to be drawn by Mr Jeffreys has not yet  been paid Br Hedlock says they cannot supply the orders as

Prayer    O GOD that made the heavens and the earth  That gave us life, that gave or, hope, that gave us birth  Forbid that our hearts should divided be  On earth, in time, in heaven, or in eternity.    Help us to lay that foundation here below  To fulfill the design of that birth thou didst bestow  O give us power that precious Covenant to seal  To make our interest one as thou shalt reveal    Behold thine hand-maden let thine angels guard her life  Protect her from sickness death and strife  Let cords of love & friendship our hearts entwine  Sealed by Inspiration light and truth divine    Thou hast known her sacra^i^fices by night & by day  Thou hast marked he'r stepts & and seen her way  Virtue &^a^nd duty has sat enthroned in her heart  Like Mary she has left all for that better part    Her Soul has been inspired to follow her LORD  Through evil and good report she's obeyed thy word  While sickness gloom and sorrow was on evry hand  She has patiently shared these evils through Zionsland    She has said to her companion go from year to year  She has dwelt with her osprings alone and shed the silent tear  She has not murmured or complained at her lot  Her sorrows found a grave in her heart in her silent cot    Thy servant has felt the force of this truth many an hour  In his meditating moments while in the strangers bower  His heart has been touched with compassion and love  Towards one who has sacraficed much for thy cause from above    O Father may not the past suffice in part  Ease her cares in life let Joy surround her heart  Let blessings upon her head in due time be poured  Thy sacred name she ever has in life adored    Take from thy servant evry thorn in life  That should cause a pain or throw a dart in strife  Let joy peace and love crown our evry hour  That glory may surround our peaceful bower    Let Phebe with her osprings live long here below  For my sake I ask thee this gift to bestow  Thus far with my follies she has patienty bourn  May I comfort her heart and not cause her to mourn    O give us power to accomplish and fulff^i^ll here below  All the work thou hast decreed upon our heads to bestow  Take from us all traditions that shall stand in our way  Of ariving at glories and dominions in eternal day    Help us to follow the example of our Lord when he cryed  It is finished it is finished and gave up the Ghost and died  In like manner may we a good and sure work perform  A work that will be accepted in the resurrection morn    Yea give us power to finish that work which to us is given  That we may survive oer the tomb and live in heaven  Then will our love forever bloom within our bower  In the midst of glory guarded by GOD's eternal power    Unto this end Eternal God I ask thy aid to help us stand  Unite our hearts in love and purity while nations fall on evry hand  Nerve Us for the conflict by the Revelations of heaven  That we may be found wise while thy judgements are given    W.

 And Now my dear Brother let me tell you that I have be^e^n seeking no less than forty years for a   People that would preach from and explain the Scriptures in agreement with the foreging but   have not found them. For in the year 1806 I first began to write in order to learn for myself   if any individual could be found among all the profesors of religion that would live up to and   honour the precepts of their great Master and now in 1846 I claim a portion of the 95th psalm   as being proved true by my own experiance. But I must decline this subject for the present and   turn to the Jews. You say the time is at hand for the Jews to be gathered to Jerusalem. Very well   I am willing for that also. And here the question arises How is this great work to be achieved?   Is it to be done by cant and quibble or is it to be done by the power of truth which cannot be over   come by any efort? I will now give my own view of the subject of 14 years standing.    In the 23rd of Matthew we find Jesus in the temple complaining or finding fault with the conduct   of the Scribes and Pharisees[.] And at the beginning of the 24th Chapter we find him come out   of the temple and his disciples or some of them tryed to turn his atention to the beauty   of the Temple on the outside. And Jesus in reply said unto them See ye not all these things?   Verily I say unto you There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not   be thrown down. He then went to the mount of Olives and his disciples followed him to the   mount of Olives and there put a threefold question to him privately saying Tell us   when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy comeing and of the end of the   world. And Jesus begins his answer to their threefold question at the middle of the 4th verse   of this 24 chapter of Matthew and he continues it without any interruption by any other   speaker to the end of the 25 chapter. Full ninety and three verses or ninety three and a half   verses of the New Testament is ocupied with the answer which Jesus returned to   the question his disciples put to him privately on the mount of Olives. Let it be understood   also that the question was put to him in the first person thus what shall be the sign of thy   comeing? But mark the grammer of his answer in the 94 verses every word of the 94   verses is in the 3rd person of grammer though the question is put to him in the 1st person.   Is it true then that Jesus Christ at this council meeting detemined to deceive and mislead   his disciples for they asked him about himself comeing at the end of that age or dispensation   but he did not tell them a word about himself comeing at the end of that age or dispensation?   As then it is as clear as language can make it that Jesus Christ never once told his disciples   that he should come again in person at the end of this wicked world I should like to know by   what means the peoy people of this generation came by such a belief. I am not here speaking   of the Latter day saints only but of the sects generally. The naked truth is this ^if^ my views   are clear that Jesus Christ abundantly foretold the comeing of some individual who   would be instrumental in convincing the Jews of their Infidelity and that to in s[t]rict   agreement with some parts of the Old Testament for the comeing of one is plainly set forth in th[e] [page torn]   Book which Jesus Christ never answered to the discription of. If I had every Jew now liveing   upon the Globe standing before me at this time in one company and could speak loud   enough for all to here I would hold up the New Testament in the sight of the multitude  and say: Look here ye Sons of Jacob Behold ye seed of Israel This Book contains the   best Prophecy of the comeing of your Deliverer and as soon as you allow this to be true   that same hour your political captivity is ended. And to the end of my life or while it   shall please Almighty God to hold me in existance so long will I defy every   Jew and every Christian Priest to deny this with true words upon their lips.   And now Brother Woodruff I invite you to call me to order if I have said any thing   contrary to the word of God. I court enquiry and desire th to be tryed by the Bible for the   Principles I hold.

 St Louis Feb 5th 1850    Dear Bro Woodruff    Yours of 11th Ult was  duly received. I was happy to hear that you  were all well, and also preparing to  go to the place we all so much desire  to see.    Bro Taylor E Snow, L Snow and  other are still with us. Expecting to get  away the first of next week. Most of  them that came from the Valley, have  had to pass through another "acclimating"  and have more or less suffered with colds. Etc.  You may be sure, we have been over  head and ears in business. since their  arrival in this City.    I have been talking with Bro Taylor  upon the subject; you wrote to me about.  He says there is a chance of getting  cattle up near the Cherrokee nation for  very much less, than they can be got  through this rege^i^eoin, he thinks they can be  got, so as to cost only about $35 a yol^k^k^e^ at  the Bluffs. That is they can be purchased  in the Cherrokee country for about $20 per yk   and the expense of driving &c would not  be above 30 or 35 $ &c &c. We anticipate  that cattle will be very high all through this  region of country, say as high as, from 50   to $60—And if you could make any arr-  angement to send an agent here in  season, say not later than the first of April  (Earlier if possible) and in connection with  those who will be purchasing here. go    [sideways text] N.

 down with drivers, buy up, and drive the  cattle to Kanesville. And in the mean while  let the companies go up by water with their  waggons, &c &c and meet the cattle there.    This I think would be a better plan, than  to go to Montrose, or any other point in  this region—for it seems as though, almost  every family all through this back country—  Illinois and all around p^a^re preparing to  go to the gold mines this spring, and on this  acct, it will be difficult to get your cattle  good Waggons are being made for about 55   dollars at present,—that is—all ready but covering  They vary however, to as high as $75.    Bro Taylor intends to send out  for his cattle in the course of one or  two week, and I suppose Bro Grant will  also at the same time. And if Br Hunter  arrives in season, he will no doubt do the  same. There will probably be quite a number   of companies starting at different times through  this season from this place & neighborhood  probably as late as the middle of May.    My family are all well, and the  Saint generally are in good health.    Remember me kindly to your family  also to all our friends.    Yours in the Gospel    N. H.

One man will say I do not want  to go to heaven if such a man goes, but no one need be troubled  about such matters for they will not go to Heaven themselves unless  they are worthy & they will not meet any one there that is not  worthy.
