 House of RepresentativesWashington. D.C. Feb 27/61Wilford Woodruff EsqrG.S.L. City. Utah Territory.Dear Bro,Your much Esteemed favorof the 24th ulto duly reached me, and it afforded me pleasureto learn of the prosperity attending. the inhabitants of ourbeloved Territory, also the peaceable time Experienced duringthe Winter. The reverse however, has characterized the movementsof the people by whom I am surrounded, the most intenseanxiety, and Excitement prevailing ever since myarrival here. I have however strove to attend to theinterests of my constituents, and kept aloof as muchas possible from participating in any political squabbles.I may say, I have been treated by all parties during thisSession, with respect, and in many instances marked courtesy,and thro' a variety of ways, my acquaintance among menof all classes is pretty Extensive, and tends to help mealong materially in the discharge of my onerous duties.I shall write Prest Young on Saturday by Pony withthe news, and as you will receive the same before this reachesyou, it will be useless to advert at length now, to the politicalmovements, indeed, things are in some respects at a stand still,all eyes are turned to the Prest Elect – to solve the problem 
 was to leave For Frederickton which I had to take in an hour aftr I got in the city so I had but little time to see St Johns. I fou[n]d the place had part of it been burned & the rest of it was in great excitemet in consequence of a row they had a day or two before I got there A company of Orangemen marched in p[r]ossessi[o]n the Catholics stoned & [illegible]them they then armed theirselves & fought with pistols guns swords &c & 15 or 20 were killed & many wounded. I visited the place of theacc^t^ions & from the ball & shot Holes in the windows doors & HomesI wonder that many more were not killed it is supposed it will be renewed. I took steemer & rode to Frederickton 100 miles up the St JohnRiver arived at 8 oclok I was still very lame & sore with my walking. I f[o]u[n]d the country both sides of the St Johns River the most beautiful farming country almost that I ever saw for so long a distance in sorough a country as the general face back in in the timber landsappears. I put at ^up^ at the Temperance Hotel in York Street. A stranger in a stra[n]gecountry. It rained most of the way up the river yet I stayed most of the time on deck to view the country & to see the Salmon & Sturgeon jump out of water.18th I learned this morning that I could not leave for Miramichi for 3 days, but musst remain there. O How Horribleto be shut up 3 or 4 days in a town for the wa[n]t of conveyance it is not so in the States. I found Frederickton a very beatiful Location upon the Bank of theriver ground lever^l^ but all the streets runing through it to the west in a strait line terminated a mile from the city on the top of a High Moutainwith a gradual risse. After examineing the city a little I went to the Post Maste[r]s to see if I could get any New York papers He told me the ownly Man in the city who took the New York Journal of Commercewas the Hon Mr Partlow Member of Parliament. I asked him wha[r]e He lived, for I was determined to Have the paperss. He told me. I called upon the Hon Gentlemen. He treated me with all politeness loaned the pape[r]s to me each day as they came in up to the Hour I left from them I got much News from the States. Learned that in 10 weeks the deathsin St Louis am[o]unted to 4321 in a pop of 45,000 that July 10th their was 190 burials there. I read the New York papers up to the 12th which I wasglad to get to pass away my time I attended a presbyterian meetingat night. the most was done was to sprnkle a litle water in a Babys back & called it Baptized which was solemn mockery befoe God 
 rather see Nauoo burned to the ground than to seeor hear of Brigham Young being martered by the Carthage mob as Joseph & Hiram has been & I would rathr they would have lived if thecity was lost, if it had been the will of God, forwe could build another city [illegible] than we could bringthem from their graves to take up their abode with usI feel more & more the importance of the responsibility restingupon us as Apostle of Jesus Christ identified withthe beginning of the rising & lifting up of Zion in thislast dispensation & preperation for the reign of Christon Earth when it is delvered from the dominionof wicked men, sin & the devil. And my daily prayerto God is that we may all live to accomplish the workassigned us with honor to our calling & our God.I wish to inform you that I sent to Londonaccording to your request for a copy of the Entryof the Book of Mormon and Lo and Behod No such Entry could be found upon the Records at the StationersHall in London I felt somwhat surprised atthis for Elder Heber C. Kimball with myselfEntered the work at least we presnted 5 copies of the 
 of the Book of Mormon to the clerk at the Statione[r]sHall & paid 3/ shillings sterling for Entering on theEight day of Feburary AD 1841 this is what both myJournals & memory say. It was Entered in theName of Joseph Smith But Elder Davis statedthat He searched the Lettr Befor Book of mormon& for Joseph Smith from 1838 to 45 & no suchEntry could be found. Their has been some trickeryin this it appea[r]s the clerk kept both the Books &money without Entering it, & I am glad it has cometo light. No the question arises what shall be doneI think I should  now be Entered in your nameas president of the Church. But I will here remarkthat I have had an interview with the American Consulwithin a few days & showed him my power of Attorneywith the idea of learning whether I could act legallyupon it if it ever came to a court of Law. He info[rm]edme I could not that for it to be legal in a courtof Law in this county, it must Have the nameof the British Consul who is in America attachedto it And if it was a power of Attorney for Englandto America it must Have the signature of the

 as to whether we are to have peace, or war, a few days howeverwill tend to relieve the present suspense. It is stated that A Lincoln will act very Conservative, and hopes are En-tertained – that by his persuing a conservative course, andsecuring around him Men of like feeling, that the BorderSlave states will be retained in the Union. Those statesthat have Seceded will it is presumed remain out. you areof course aware, that they have organized an independentGovt, adopted a Constitution, and Elected Jefferson DavisPrest, and A. H. Stephens Vice Prest. Mr Davis inhis inaugural address at Montgomery, Ala. has stated,that the day for Compromise, or reconstruction has past.Prest Lincoln visited the Senate on Monday last, whilethere, I was introduced to him by Senator Trumbull, of Illinois,—as an old resident of Illinois—well, and favorably known,and now the Delegate from Utah.I presume before thisreaches, you will have learned that the Utah War debthas passed the Senate, and now only waits for the signatureof the Prest to the Bill, to become a law. I need hardlysay, that it has taken no little amunt of labor, and wirepulling, on my part, to get it thro'.As you observe, Ihave presented the Memorial of my Constituents for theAdmission of 'Deseret' as a State into the Union, butI presume from the intimations I have received from the Membersof the Territorial Committee, to whom the Memorial was referred, 
 20th I took passage at 11 oclok to day in a thing they call a stage to ride n^i^ght& day 100 miles to Miramichi through the forest. I will describe the stageone pairs of Horses was put onto the tongue of an open lumber Waggonwith two seats in it the 1st seat was occupied by the drivers & MrFrazier with their feet on the Mail Bag. I occupied the 2nd seat abovemaking a driver & two passengers the Bottom of the Box ran out behindthe waggon 4 feet upon which stood a large Heavy chest. next wasanother waggon with the long run under the first waggon & fastenedto it with ropes the se[c]ond waggon was loaded with wood& trunks And with this train of two waggons & lumber hitched behind two Horses westarted to travel all day & all night through a forest country vary Hilly for 100 milesAnd when I herd the driver tell about getting through in 24 Hours I thoughtit would be more likely to take a week for I did not see how He was going to go outof a walk with such a train of cars behind him But I was soon undecieved & my eyeswere opened for it was very Hilly & long Hills in many places & as soon as He cameto the top of a steep Hill, His Horses could not Hold the two waggons if they fellever so much disposed to so of course the ownly way was to run fast enough to keep outof the way of the waggons so by the time I had rode down a few long Hills with theHorses upon A keen run which speed they would not break untill they reach halfwayto the top of the next Hill. I began to think to we should soon get through our journeybut I thought it much more likely to end at the bottom of some tremendiousprecipice or off a bridge in some brook which were vary freequant on the road, th[wax seal]to End in Miramichi & that to before the light of anoth day. And in this way [wax seal]we went dashing down Hills, through gullies, & over bridges He Ho [H]e ho like unt^i^lll midnight21st l oclok in the Morning changed Horses, took tea, got in waggon. A fresh pair of Horsesput into A run, down Hills, with two waggons at their Heels, the driver & his companionboth sound asleep dark night, cannot see the road, Nothing but God or Angels can guideus. Horses go whare they please, & probably it is better for the driver to be asleep than awakefor they may keep the road. My wife need never to call me an unlucky man if I ever live tosee day light again. Phebe would you not like to take a ride with me what an interesting JourneyI am Having. I am telling the truth just as it is we rode all night long in this way to broadday light & down evry Hill from 10 rods to quarter of a mile long the Horses would go upona run & the drivers & Frazier slept for two hours after day light for which I was gladto see. we came near being dashed to atoms runing down a Hill after day light. I couldnot tell so much about the danger in the night but this child did not sleep untill After day lightI then caught myself noding a few times but they were short naps. I Arived At Capt JosephRussells at ll oclock And was glad to leave the stage & find myself alive I called upon Br RussellAnd we had A Happy Meeting Br & sister Russell were both glad to se me I felt tierd out with riding& excitement.

The cry hasbeen now these Mericans [Americans] are going it will all fall to nothingbut these are not my expectations & I believe not my BrensBut among this their has been disagreeable cases thathave lately occured one of which was before the councilon the 10 th concerning separating the terms Christ & Jesusmakeing the divine to be Christ and the human Jesus thehearing of this subject took some time but was ultimatelyconcluded ^carried^ by the officers that this subject be dropped entirelyor at least that no attempts be made to separate the two termsin the way before mentioned there has^v^e been several ordinationsto the differant offices and under the hands of Messrs Cordon & Simpsonalso a number of baptisms (upwards of thirty) since you leftand the work seems progressing stedily in great power &is true that is and allways will be untill the Church beperfect some efforts and every week part watched inorder to make some divission and seems Dear Bro[s] asthis would prove to be but the beginging of such things

W. and hesaid he did not think any thing about it his wanting him, this was s[page torn]what strange but suffice it to say that Mr. Deming advertised for ashingle sawer he received a letter from a man whom he thought would answer their purpose—the other morn. when Br [Ulny] was here Mr. Camecame in & a gentleman with him after makeing some enquires about C. healthhe says to me my object in comeing in was to let this gentleman look about the house—being somewhat surprise I said why I supposed that the man that wascomeing here would have a house for his family elsewhere—well said Mr. C. I knownothing about it only that Mr. Deming sent me here to let this gentleman see thehouse & I not thinking of any thing more than haveing a family come in I said Mr. C. you must think there are no conveniences for 2 families in this housethis he semed to assent to. I furthermore said that we were expecting our son thisspring from Eng & probably other friends & also that we were expecting the marriage ceremony to be performed &c I told him I would wait on him about the house if he wishedbut he declined—the next day your father said he more thought they were going to let the whole establishment to him as he did not wish to take any part unless he could have the wholewe have heard nothing since on the same morn Mr. C. took your father aside and asked him ifhe was tired tending the mill he said not this is all we know of the affair. your father feels bad about it but we tell him it may all be for the best & we desire your counsil upon it.

 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation Psalm 95 Verse the 10thI have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation ^Psalm 119 v 99^When the Son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth? Luke chap 18 v 8thTo President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother On Sunday the 21st of December I was visited by an Elder who told me that a proclaimation was comeing out and on the 11th of JanuaryI visited a small company of Saints and obtained a copy of the same which since then I have read with deep interest. On the 6th page you say no individual will stand neutral and this I firmly believe and therefore I find it impossible to stand neutral[.] I cannot rest contented without makeing some reply. Page 13 God has said that if the Gentiles do not repent and come to the knowledge of the truth and cease to fight against Zion and also put away all murder lying pride priestcraft whoredom and secret abomination they shall soon perish from the earth and be cast down to hell. God hath also said that the time is at hand for the Jews to be gathered to Jerusalem. On these two points of doctrine I feel desireous to speak.If the Gentiles are ^to^ put away these evil practices they must have some body to preach to them exactly in the same manner as Jesus Christ did preach when he first made his public appearance among men: and thes the Gentiles have not had that I am aware of since the 3rd century. Let the 5th 6th and 7th chapters of Matthew be brought upon the carpet and carefully examined[.] And let us see if his first and chiefest sermon contains any thing calculated to give political and heathen Governments hope that they should have any thing to do in establishing the kingdom of God. Let my brethren the Latter day Saints or as many of them as are in Office join with me in preaching or publishing to the Gentile world the laws of Jesus Christ in their literas [literal] sense and free from corruption and error This I say hath not been the practice of the gentile cleargy in my time for if ^it^ had I must have heard it at some time ^or^ other within the space of three score years.Nothing is more evident to me than that it was the intention of Jesus to give and to leave with his Church a sample of laws that should be soficient for their guidance in all ages if theywould receive and abide by them as they ought to do. To suppose that ^the^ moral precepts of Jesus Christ as delivered in his sermon on the mountain is not soficient for all the moral purposes of his disciples is to suppos a deficiency in the wisdom of God in sending Jesus Christ on the errand he did send him. Those who make laws in oposition and contrary to the laws of Jesus Christ and enforce them by the point of the bayonet while they call themselvs christians virtueally says to their Maker "Thou art a fool thou dost not know so well as we do by whatLaws the people ought to be governed." Two of the petitions in the prayer which our Lord composed for the use of his disciples are noticed in this proclaimation and I ask leave to notice another ofthem. Forgive us our trespases (How and in what manner?) as we forgive them that trespas against us[.] What are we not to be forgiven but upon this condition? Here the answer of Jesus to this question. If ye forgive not men their trespases neither will your Father foHe^a^venly Father forgive your trespases. This is intilligable language there is no quibbleing [page torn] [i]n this doctrine. This sort of Prayer it is clear to me was taught by the saviour to prevent or hinder his Saints from praying blasphemy. But how do I forgive those who trespas against me if as soon as they have do^ne^ so I fly to ha heathen ^laws^ for shelter and revenge?But what does such practice imply? It implys something to this efect namel[y] that Christianity is a cheat played off upon the world and that it hath no foundation in truth. It gos to teach that man knows better than God does what amount of chastisemen the wicked ought to receive for their cruelty th to their fellow creatures—and also knows better when such chastisement ought to be inflicted. The laws of Jesus Christ are a part of t^h^e law of God so highly extoled in the Hundred and nineteenth psalm for they came to man from God through the same Jesus ChristOne of the laws that he delivered is as follows[:] What so ever ye would that men should do unto you do ye also unto them. Here is an appeal to our reason and to the inward convictions of our own heart If then our heart and our reason do testify that when we our selves do transgress the bounds of love and actually trespas against our brother ^or^ sister as that perhaps we may for we are not perfect or not so perfect as not to be liable to fall if I say our reason and our hearts do testify that in such a case we would prefer punishment to forgiveness then indeed this last mentioned law of Jesus Christ will allow people with this convi^c^tion to resist litteraly moral evil in other peopleBut I trust I have too much good sense about ^me^ to pretedd pretend to believe that such a man ex^i^steth on the Globe. For if such a thing could be proved it would also prove that Christianity it[s]elf [page torn] is nothing more than a jumble of absurdity confusion and self contradiction and Consequently not worthy the attention of any reasonable man.

As to the order On Harden & Company the money wasnever deposited with them. Elder Hedlock says in consequenceof paying some back debts & sending over so many withoutpay the Office is some in debt.

 And Now my dear Brother let me tell you that I have be^e^n seeking no less than forty years for a People that would preach from and explain the Scriptures in agreement with the foreging but have not found them. For in the year 1806 I first began to write in order to learn for myself if any individual could be found among all the profesors of religion that would live up to and honour the precepts of their great Master and now in 1846 I claim a portion of the 95th psalm as being proved true by my own experiance. But I must decline this subject for the present and turn to the Jews. You say the time is at hand for the Jews to be gathered to Jerusalem. Very well I am willing for that also. And here the question arises How is this great work to be achieved? Is it to be done by cant and quibble or is it to be done by the power of truth which cannot be over come by any efort? I will now give my own view of the subject of 14 years standing.In the 23rd of Matthew we find Jesus in the temple complaining or finding fault with the conduct of the Scribes and Pharisees[.] And at the beginning of the 24th Chapter we find him come out of the temple and his disciples or some of them tryed to turn his atention to the beauty of the Temple on the outside. And Jesus in reply said unto them See ye not all these things? Verily I say unto you There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. He then went to the mount of Olives and his disciples followed him to the mount of Olives and there put a threefold question to him privately saying Tell us when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy comeing and of the end of the world. And Jesus begins his answer to their threefold question at the middle of the 4th verse of this 24 chapter of Matthew and he continues it without any interruption by any other speaker to the end of the 25 chapter. Full ninety and three verses or ninety three and a half verses of the New Testament is ocupied with the answer which Jesus returned to the question his disciples put to him privately on the mount of Olives. Let it be understood also that the question was put to him in the first person thus what shall be the sign of thy comeing? But mark the grammer of his answer in the 94 verses every word of the 94 verses is in the 3rd person of grammer though the question is put to him in the 1st person. Is it true then that Jesus Christ at this council meeting detemined to deceive and mislead his disciples for they asked him about himself comeing at the end of that age or dispensation but he did not tell them a word about himself comeing at the end of that age or dispensation? As then it is as clear as language can make it that Jesus Christ never once told his disciples that he should come again in person at the end of this wicked world I should like to know by what means the peoy people of this generation came by such a belief. I am not here speaking of the Latter day saints only but of the sects generally. The naked truth is this ^if^ my views are clear that Jesus Christ abundantly foretold the comeing of some individual who would be instrumental in convincing the Jews of their Infidelity and that to in s[t]rict agreement with some parts of the Old Testament for the comeing of one is plainly set forth in th[e] [page torn] Book which Jesus Christ never answered to the discription of. If I had every Jew now liveing upon the Globe standing before me at this time in one company and could speak loud enough for all to here I would hold up the New Testament in the sight of the multitudeand say: Look here ye Sons of Jacob Behold ye seed of Israel This Book contains the best Prophecy of the comeing of your Deliverer and as soon as you allow this to be true that same hour your political captivity is ended. And to the end of my life or while it shall please Almighty God to hold me in existance so long will I defy every Jew and every Christian Priest to deny this with true words upon their lips. And now Brother Woodruff I invite you to call me to order if I have said any thing contrary to the word of God. I court enquiry and desire th to be tryed by the Bible for the Principles I hold.Painswick J Gloucestershire January the 19th 1846 Wm HamletOr Bull House near Painswick GloucestershireWilliam HamlettPS Is not your prayer written in the last verse of the twentieth Psalm?[sideways text] Wm Hamlet [end of sideways text]

 fast as they come & thinks in consequence of the prejudices& feelings of the Saints in this country, that it would bemuch better for the Temple money to be sent to Nauvoothan to be paid on Orders here, thinks if it should beknown that it would be a blow up to collecting funds forthe Temple here they not knowing the circumstances thattheir money is used for other purposes than for the temple.I see from papers & Letters that the Saints in Nauvoo areabout entering unto [into] a systemmatical course of manuf-acturing various articles for home consumption I think theircan be a system entered into in this country to cooperatewith them in Nauvoo to a good [illegible] which we shallspeak of more hereafter, & I think the Emegration businesscan be carried on to a greater extent than what it has beenheretofore.

 St Louis Feb 5th 1850Dear Bro WoodruffYours of 11th Ult wasduly received. I was happy to hear that youwere all well, and also preparing togo to the place we all so much desireto see.Bro Taylor E Snow, L Snow andother are still with us. Expecting to getaway the first of next week. Most ofthem that came from the Valley, havehad to pass through another "acclimating"and have more or less suffered with colds. Etc.You may be sure, we have been overhead and ears in business. since theirarrival in this City.I have been talking with Bro Taylorupon the subject; you wrote to me about.He says there is a chance of gettingcattle up near the Cherrokee nation forvery much less, than they can be gotthrough this rege^i^eoin, he thinks they can begot, so as to cost only about $35 a yol^k^k^e^ atthe Bluffs. That is they can be purchasedin the Cherrokee country for about $20 per yk and the expense of driving &c would notbe above 30 or 35 $ &c &c. We anticipatethat cattle will be very high all through thisregion of country, say as high as, from 50 to $60—And if you could make any arr-angement to send an agent here inseason, say not later than the first of April(Earlier if possible) and in connection withthose who will be purchasing here. go[sideways text] N.

 down with drivers, buy up, and drive thecattle to Kanesville. And in the mean whilelet the companies go up by water with theirwaggons, &c &c and meet the cattle there.This I think would be a better plan, thanto go to Montrose, or any other point inthis region—for it seems as though, almostevery family all through this back country—Illinois and all around p^a^re preparing togo to the gold mines this spring, and on thisacct, it will be difficult to get your cattlegood Waggons are being made for about 55 dollars at present,—that is—all ready but coveringThey vary however, to as high as $75.Bro Taylor intends to send outfor his cattle in the course of one ortwo week, and I suppose Bro Grant willalso at the same time. And if Br Hunterarrives in season, he will no doubt do thesame. There will probably be quite a number of companies starting at different times throughthis season from this place & neighborhoodprobably as late as the middle of May.My family are all well, and theSaint generally are in good health.Remember me kindly to your familyalso to all our friends.Yours in the GospelN.
