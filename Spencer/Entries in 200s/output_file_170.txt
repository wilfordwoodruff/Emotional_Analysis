I also wish to bear  my testimony to all Nations under heavens Emperors  Kings, Presidents, Statesmen, Govornors, Judges, all  Rulers and the Rulled, Jew and Gentile who dwell upon  the face of the whole Earth My Testimony is this unto  all Men and Nations. That you live in the day and hour  of the Judgments of God Almighty. You live in the day  and generation when the God of Israel has set his hand  to perform his work his strange work in the Latter days Yoy live in the age in which God will bring to pass the  fulfillment of that flood of Prophesy and Revelation  which has been spoken by all the Prophets since the world began, which stands recorded in the Sacred Books of  Divine truth, And the fullfillment of those Revelations will involve the Destiny of the whole world Jew and Gentile  Rich and poor, High and low, saint and sinner Babylon and  Zion. Therefore prepare yourselves O ye inhabitants of  the Earth for the hour of Gods Judgments is at the door As it was in the days of Lot so shall it be  in the days of the coming of the Son of man. ##Matthew 24:37## First to the Saints of God who have Entered into covenant with   ENDENTRY 2  the Lord and have been ordained unto the Holy  Priesthood. if you are living your religion and  Enjoying the spirit of inspiration which is your Duty you know as God Lives, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of  God, that He received the Administration of Angels, that He  brought forth the Book of Mormon and translated it By  the power of God. you know He received the fulness of  the Everlasting Gospel, and the Holy Priesthood, and  Apostleship, and the Keys there off, and He organized  the Church of Christ the ownly true and living Church upon the face of the whole Earth with its gifts and graces thereoff with which the Lord is well pleased; you also know Joseph Smith the Prophet left his testiment  upon the Earth, and sealed that testiment with his  own life and Blood, and that testiment is in force  upon all the world. And that Testiment is filled with  the Revelations of God that stands upon its pages  like flames of Living fire, ready to be fulfilled upon  all the inhabitants of the Earth. In this testiment the  Lord has commanded his servants to go to all the world  and Preach this gospel of the Kingdom to Every creature  as far as doors can be opened. He has also commanded  his servants to visit Boston, and  all the Notible cities and villages of the world, and  reproving them of their ungodly deeds and warning them of the Desolation and utter abolishment which awaits  them if they reject the servants of God or their testimony for with you saith the Lord Almighty I will rend   ENDENTRY 3 their Kingdoms. I will shake not ownly the Earth but  the starry Heaven shall tremble you cannot see it now  but soon you shall see it and know that I an God ye Latter Day Saints do ye not know these things are  true. You do, and so do I, for the spirit of God bears  Record, and the record is truth, and truth abideth forever under these circumstances what manner of men and women ought  we to be ##3 Nephi 27:27## are we prepared as a people for thesse great Events which await us as a people. Judge Ye, what is our duty as saints of  the Living God. It is our duty to humble ourselves befor the  Lord and call upon his name untill we are filled with the  Holy Ghost and the spirit of Inspiration, walk in the  Light of Christ, Pay our Tigesthes and offerings, keep the commandments of God, and have faith in his word, remem- ber and honor our covenants, obligations, and ordinan- ces we hav Entered into in the Holy Places and Temples of our  God. We should unite ourselves together in a temporal  as well as spiritual point of view, as directed by the  wise men of Israel. We should seek to build up the kingdom of God and Zion and not alone ourselves. When we do  thiese theings then we are prepared as a people to let  our Prayers ascend into the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth from one End of Heaven to the other, and they will be heard and  answered upon our heads. Again this Testiment which  Joseph Smith has left contains a Revelation and Commandment  from God out of Heaven concerning the Patriarchal  order of Marriage. The Lord has commanded us to have ^our^ wives  and children sealed to us for time and Eternity that we may   ENDENTRY 4 have them with us in our family organization in  the Resurrection to dwell with us forever in the Eternal  worlds that we may have an increas of posterity forever in connextion with Jacob and all  the Ancient Patriarch's And God Our Heavenly Father  Knowing that this was the ownly Law ordained by  the Gods of Eternity that would Exhalt Immortal  Beings to Kingdoms, Thrones, Principalities, Powers and  dominions and heirs of God, and Joint heirs of Jesus  Christ to a fulness of Celestial Glory. I say the God of  Israel knowing these things commanded Joseph Smith the Prophet and the Latter Day Saints to obey this  Law or you shall be damned Saith the Lord. Now  after obeying this law for many years. The Congress of  the United States, and the Supreme Judges of the  Nation theyn stand forth and say you shall be  damned if you do obey it. Now Ye Latter Day Saints what are you going to do under these circumstances God says we shall be damned of we do not obey  the Law, Congress says we shall be damned if we do. It places us precisely in the same position that it  did the Hebrews in the firey furnice ##Daniel 3##, or Daniel in the  Den of Lions ##Daniel 6##}. The Enemies of Daniel counciled together and said we cannot find any occasion against this  Daniel except we find it against him concerning the Law  of his God. Our Enemies have persued the same cource  and the Law makers and Judges have Joined with  them, and made it a Law of Offence to obey one of the   ENDENTRY 5 Laws of Our god Now who shall we obey God or  Man. My voice is we shall obey God, we have but  a short time to live here we have a long Eternity to live on the other side of the Veil. This position takes the  Matter ouentirely out of our hands, the warefare now is  between God and the Nation. I am an American  Citizen I was born and raised in the State of Connecticut I wish to Ask the Law Makers and Judges a few  questions. By what power was Columbus inspired to  plead before the courts of Europe to assist him to fit out a fleet to cross the ocean, to find a western continent By what power was He protected untill He accomplished this. By what Power was our forefathers inspired to cross the ocean to inherit this land, and when they had inher- ited the land, and the yoak of bondage laid upon their necks by their Mother Country to grieveious to be bourrn they  rose up as a Nation and Declaired there independance and passed through an Eight years war at the Expens of much Blood and treasure, and finally maintained  their Independance and Esstablished a free and  Independant Government which was acknowledged  by the Nations of the Earth. By what power was the  Constitution of the United States inspired formed  framed, and Adopted as the Supreme Law of the Land  to be handed down as a rich Legacy to their posterity  from Generation to Generation All these Blessings have  been obtained by the Inspiration of Almighty God, and  the will of heaven. This glorious instrument   ENDENTRY 6 Guarantees unto all its Citizens the rights of religion Life Liberty and the persuit of Happiness. The right  of the Enjoyment of Religion of any Citizen in this  Republic has never been questioned by any Congress  or Judges of the Law untill of late. When both the  Congress of the United States and Judges of the  Law have taken a step to deprive a Hundred  and Fifty thousand of her Citizens the right to  Enjoy their religion which the Constitution garantees unto them, Will not the same God who has  given this Nation a free Government and an  Inspired Constitution of Equal rights to all  Men who dwell beneath its broad folds, Hold  the Rulers and Judges of the Land responsible  for the use they make of the power in their Hands? He will. The Congress of 1862 And the  Supreme Judges of 1878 in there acts and  Decisions have taken a Dangerous and fearful  step. Their acts will sap the vary foundation  of our Government and it will be rent in twain and the God of Heaven will hold them responsible for these things. For what men sow thyey will  reap ##Galatians 6:7## And the measure they will meet unto others  will be meeted unto them saith the Lord ##Matthew 7:2##. When the  Constitution is one broken by the rulers of the  Land there will be no stoping place untill the  Nation is broaken in peaces, and no power  beneath the Heavens can save this Nation   ENDENTRY 7 from the consequences thereof a, And all Rulers of this Nation as well as other Nations will have to  give an account to the Judge of all the Earth for the Use they make of the power put into their hands Virtue Exhalteth a Nation while sin is a reproach to any People. The question was asked the Hebrews  what God is there that is able to deliver you out of the Hands of King Nebuchadnezzar A righteous answer of faith was given. We do not know that our God will  deliver us out of your hands, But be it known unto the O King that we will not serve thy Gods, men worship the golden Image which thou hast set up. ##Daniel 3:15-18## So I say as an Apostle  of the Lord Jesus Christ I will not desert my wifves and my children, and Disobey the commandments of God, for the sake of accomidating the public clammers of a generation steeped in sin and Ripened for the Damnation of Hell I would rathr go to prision and to Death * ^see page^ 13   I wish in this testimony to say to the Jews to the Rothchilds, to Diserilla and all rich Jews take your gold, and your silver from the hands  of the Gentiles and Buy Jerrusalem, and all the Holy land and all the Land given to Abraham your great Progenitor. Go to and  Rebuild your city Jerrusalem and Temple for your deliverance is at the door. Gather together your Brethren the Jews from all the  Gentile Nations, for the fullness of the Gentiles has come in  And the Lord has decreed that the Jews shall be gathered from  all the Gentile Nations whether they have been driven into there own land in fulfillment of the words of Moses your Law- Giver And this the will of your Great Eloheem And   ENDENTRY 8 whenever you turn your hand to this work the God of Israel will help you. You have a great future and destiny before you and you cannot avoid fulfilling it You are  the royal chosen seed and the God of your fathers have  kept you distinct as a Nation for Eighteen hundred  years under all the oppression of the whole Gentile  world. Therefor Arise O Judah and return home we ask you not to wait untill you believe in Jesus  of Nazareth, but when you meet with Shilo your King you will know him. Your Destiny is marked is marked  out, you cannot avoid it. It is true that after you return and gather your Nation home and rebuild your city and Temple that the Gentiles may gather together their armies to go against you to Battle for to take a prey and to take a spoil which they will do for the words of your Prophets must be fulfilled. But when this affliction comes the same God that Lead Moses through the wilderness will deliver you and your Shilo will come and s^t^and  in your midst and will fight your Batteles and you will Know him. And the affliction of the Jews will have an End while the destruction of the Gentilesles will be so great that it will take the whole house of Israel who are gathered about Jerres- alem seven months to bury the Dead of their Enemies And the weapons of war will last them seven years  for fuel so they need not go to any forest for wood.    These are Tremendious sayings who can bear then Never- theless they are true and will be fulfilled according to the sayings of Zachariah and other prophets though   ENDENTRY 9 the Heavens and Earth Pass away not one jot or tittle wasll will fall unfulfilled. I would say to the Lamanits  if I could speak to their understanding that you are also a Branch of the House of Irsrael, and once Belonged to Pleasant Ephraim, and your forefathers have fallen  through the same Example of unbelief and sin, as have the Jews, and you areas their posterity have wandered  in sin and darkness for Many Generations, and you like the Jews have been driven and tramplled under the feet of the Gentiles, and put to death through your wars with Each other and with the white man, untill you are almost annihilated from off the Earth But there is still a redemption and salvation for a  Remnant of you in the Latter Days. It is time for you to scease your warefare with each other and sheding each  others Blood, or making war upon your fellow men cease to shed Blood, learn to cultivate the Earth, and  raise your food from the Earth. Call upon the great spirit to protect you and deliver you from Bondage and  Darkness, and the Great Spirit will hear you and  deliver you, and a Remnant of you will again become a Delightsome people as your Forefathers were when they kept the commandments of God. Could I speak to the Ten Tribes of Israel in that North Country  I would say call upon the God of your Fathers of  Jacob That your Prophets may  come in Rememberance before God. That they may  hear his voice, And no longer stay themselves but   ENDENTRY 10 smite the rocks that the Mountains of Ice may flow down at their presence. An high way shall be cast up in the midst of the Great Deep ##Doctrine and Covenants 133:27##. Their Enemies  shall become a prey unto them. Bring forth your Records and Rich treasures unto three children of Ephraim  the servants of the Lord in the Land of Zion, And the boundaries of the everlasting Hills shall tremble at  your presence, And you shall fall down and be crowned  with Glory Even in Zion by the Hands of the servants of the Lord Ephr Even the chrilden of Ephraim, And you shall be filled with Songs of Everlasting Joy Behold this is the Blessing of the Everlasting God upon the tribes of Israel, And the richer blessing upon the  head of Ephraim and his fellows. These Events refered to, are but a vary limited portion of the  Revelations of God which are about to be fulfilled upon the heads of this Generation. I wish to warn all Nations of the judgements of God which are at thereir door. Thrones will be cast down, Nations will be overturned, Anarchy will reign, all barriers of Law  will be trampled in the dust. You are about to be visited with war, the sword, famine, pestilence Plague Earthquakes whirlwinds, tempest and with the flame of Devouring fire. For By fire and the sword will the Lord plead with all flesh, and the slain of the Lord will be many ##Isaiah 66:16##. The  sword of the Lord is bathed in heaven and is about to fall on  Idumea ##Isaiah 34:5## or the world for his anger is kindled and the slain  of the Lord will be many and who is able to abide these things   ENDENTRY 11 And who will stand when He appeareth. The fig trees are leaving, and the signs of all heavens and Earth indicate  the Coming of the Son of Man. The seals are about to be opened, the plagues to be poured forth, Your river and seas will  be turned to Blood ##Revelation 16:3-4##, and to gaul, and the inhabitants of the Earth will die of those plagues. And the unbelief of Great Babylon with the whole Christian world will not make the truths of God without Effect. Let the world for an example look at  the Ancient Cities of the Nations, whare is Tyre, Nineveh, And Babylon the Great which were built to defy all time and all power but God himself? They were  laid in the dust, and their inhabitants destroyed when they were ripened in iniquity and that to in fulfillment of the word  of God unto them through the voice of humble men, who spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. In like manner was Jerrusalem destroyed and the Jews scattered among  the Gentiles in fulfillment of the words of Moses and Jesus Christ. Will the Lord any more spare the cities of the Gentiles and Great Babylon than the ancient cities and  the cities of the Jews? No, verrily No. The question may be asked why are these Judgments coming upon the world  in the last days. I answer because of the wickedness of the inhabitants thereof. The vary Proclamation of the Angel  of God when He delivered the fulness of the Gospel as recorded  in the Revelations of St John, was "crying with a loud  voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of Gods Judgment is come". ##Revelation 14:7## ^and when that proclamation was made to Joseph Smith the prophet it was half a centaury ago^ Light has come into the world and Men love darkness rather than the light because their deeds are Evil   ##John 3:19-21## ENDENTRY 12 The Lord has raised up Prophets And Apostles who have cryed aloud to this Generation with the proc- lamation of the gospel for half a centaury and warned  them of the Judgments which were to come, And the inhabitants of the Earth have rejected this Testimony and shed the Blood of the Lords Anointed, and persecuted  the Saints of God, And the consequence is that darkness  covers the Earth, and gross darkness the people and the Lord is withholding his spirit from the inhabitants of the Earth and the Devil is ruling over his own Kingdom  and sin wickedness and abominations of Every kind  have increased a hundred fold within the last few  years untill the whole Earth is filled with Murder whoredom  Blasphemies and Every crime in the Black catalogue that was manifest in the Antideluvian world or Sodem  and Gomorrah untill the whole Earth groans under its abominations, and the Heavens weep and all Eternity is pained And the Angels are waiting the Great command  to go forth and reap down the Earth. This testimony  I bear to all Nations under Heavens. This is my faith,  my belief, and my opinion. I know they are true by the inspiration of Almighty God. And the decree of the supreme court of the United States, bears me out in the opinion that the Constitution gives me the privilege of Enjoying my  Belief, faith, and opinion in Religion if I do not act.  Therefore the action, and Execution of ^all^ these Tremendious Events I leave for the God of Heaven to Execute which He most assuredly will.   ENDENTRY 13 What I have spoken I have spoken and I excuse not  myself And though the Heavens and Earth pass away my words will not pass away ##Matthew 24:35## but will all be fulfilled saith the Lord of Hosts I subscribe myself an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ And a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints The following page was omitted in copy Wilford Woodruff   * If I would not I would never be fit to associate with the prophets and Patriarchs of old, and I could not But despise in my heart  any man who professed to be a latter day saint who would do otherwise. Why should ^we^ fear man who ownly has power to  kill the Body more than him who has power to cast both body and soul into Hell. Christ says when men speak all manners  of Evil against you and persecute you for Righteousness sake rejoice and be Exceding Glad for so persecuted they the  Prophets and Apostles who were before you ##Matthew 5:11-12## I would say to all Israel treat your wives and children Kindly and keep  the Commandments of God and trust in him and He will fight your battles And I will say in the Name of Jesus Christ  the son of the living God That Mormonism will Live and  prosper, Zion will flourish, And the Kingdom of  God will stand in Power, Glory, and Dominion as David saw it when this Nation is broaken in peaces as a potters vessel and laid in the dust and brought to Judgment or God never spake by my mouth. Therefore I say to all the Saints throughout the world be faithful and tru to your God To your religion to your families and to yourselves Jesus of Nazereth has suffered death on the cross for   ENDENTRY 14 Feb 27, 1879 the redemption of the world And his Apostles followed his Example for the word of God and the Testimony of Jesus Christ. And Joseph Smith has proved to the Heaven and Earth To God Angels and Men that He would abide in his Covenant  Even unto Death And none of us will ever be called to  do any thing more. Any of us would certainly be ashamed  to deny the faith to accomodate our Enemies then meet the Prophets and Apostles in the spirit world. May God forbid that this should be the case with any of the Blood of Ephraim    ENDENTRY February 27, 1879 ~ Thursday   Feb 27.
