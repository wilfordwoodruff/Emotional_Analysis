 July 28 [18]60 [FIGURES]Young had to remoadle the sckeleton of the sermon before us After the Prophet Joseph died, the Question was asked how will the Church existand be governed now the Prophet is dead, will the Twelve lead if so can they get Revelation, President Young took up this subject & showed whatthe privliges were of all the Saints from the least to the greatest, all saints maleand female have the privilege of revelation, of inspiration, the spirit of God the Holy Ghost. all saints should live in the spirit of revelation. A Priest after the order of Aaron holds the keys of the Administering of Angels will Angels administer to a man and visit him & not reveal any thing to him No. then if Priests can have revelation cannot Aposttles yes. Evry part of the Melchezedeck Priesthood from an Elder tothe Presidency of the Church have a right to receive RevelationsFrom the face of the Lord direct without the Administration ofan Angel. Both Priesthoods are divided into classes as helps in the government of God. Elders Belong to the Melchezedek priesthood, as Deakons & teachers do to the Aaronic Priesthood High Priests are for Presidentsto preside over different Branches & stakes & to administer in all the ordinances of the Melchezedek Priesthood. The Seventies are special witnesses or& apostles to go into all the world to preach the gospel unto all Nations to Build up the Kingdom of God, & Esstablish churches in allthe Earth under the direction of the Twelve Apostles they should call upon the High Priest to come & preside over the Branches after they are built up a Quorum of ^70^ Apostles when united are Equal in authority to the Quorumof the Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles or traveling council are to be special witnnessese of the name of Christ in all the world they are Equal in athhorityin there decissions to the Presidency of the Church they are to preside in allthe world whare the three first Presidency are not. The three first Presidency Preside over the whole Church & administer in all theordinances of the Church, which consists of a President & his two councellors the President of the Church holds the keys of the sealing powers & his council act in concert with him in all thingsshould the Presidency die The Twelve could organize another Presidency & should the Presidency & Twelve all be slain the seventies being Equal in power & Authority to the Twelve or first Presidency could organize both Quorums. A Bishop has two councellors there is no difference in the authority of his councillors the 2nd has as much 
 28 July ^1860^authority as the first. A Bishop should have his councilers with him on the trial of a case in order to make it Legal as it takes three to makea Quorum. The High Priest could organize the Church in all its parts if all other Authorities were dead for they have the Melchezedek Priesthood out of which grow all of the Higher offices of the Church An Apostle is the highest office in the Church & kingdom of God Joseph Smith was a Prophet Seer & Revelator before he was baptized or ordained, to the Aaronic Priesthood or had any Authority to adm-inister one of the ordinances of the house of the Lord. He was afterwardsordained to the Aaronic Priesthood then to the Melchezedek priesthood& Apostleship which is the highest office in the Church & kingdom of God on Earth. When a man is ordained to the Apostleship & keys thereoff if he dies in faith He will hold those keys to all Eternity all the Prophets APatriarchs & Apostles who ever did or ever will hold the keys of the Apostleship if faithful unto death will hold them forever. President Young was an Elder when he was orda[ine]d to be one of the Twelve Apostles some asked the Question how Hecould officiate as an High Priest not having previously been orda[ine]d a High Priest Joseph said the Apostleship covered all the offices of the High Priesthood, the same as a private member orda[ine]d a High Priest could officiate as a Deakon Teacher Priest or Elder President Young said "I ordained most of the two or three firstQuorums of the Seventies and Joseph gave me vary particularinstructions to ordain them all High Priests which I did when a man is ordained an High Priest Seventy or one of the Twelve Hecan officiate in all the lesser offices of the Church whether He has been ordained to that office or not. When I met with the Saints in Nauvoo at the first meeting after Josephs death in defending the true organization aga[in]st Sidney Rigdon I had it in my mindall the time that there would have to be a Presidency of three Appointed but I knew the people could not bear it at the time and on our return as the pioneers from the valley IBroached the subject first to Brother Woodruff and afterwords to the rest of the Quorum they received it & finally sustained itI spent the afternoon in the office Journalizing

Pratt W. Woodruff J. Taylor G. A. Smith E. Snow F. D. Richards & G. Q. Cannon of the Twelve met for Prayer when the followingconversation took place President Young said the people of the United Stateshad sought our destruction and they had used every Exertion to perfect it they have worked through the Masonic institution to per-fect it Joseph & Hyrum Smith were Master Masons and they were put to death by masons or through there instigation and he gave the sign of distress & he was shot by masons while in the act, and therewere delegates from the various lodges in the Union to see that he was put to death {{[and/he?] damns them}} I hope to live to see the day when I can have powerto make them do right they have got the blood of the prophets upon theirheads & they have got to meet it. When President Buchannan & the U.S. Government sent Col Johnson & the U.S. Army to Utah it was with the Express purpose to destroy the Church & kingdom from off the Earth to put to death this people but the Lord sustained us & put them to shame & confusion & to his name be the honor & glory. There are other Masonssent to this territory for the same purpose to Esstablish a lodge here & try to get an influence with some here to lay a plan to try to murderme & the leaders of the Church but they will not accomplish it, now BrotherL. N. Scovill thinks so much of masonery that he might Join in withthem, G. A. Smith, said He does not wish to mix hair & wool but he would like to Go to England & obtain five charters for lodgeswhich would give us a grand lodge which would make us independentof all other Grand lodges in the world, this is what Brother Scovillwould like to do and this could be done but I do not think he wouldbe willing to mingle with our Enemies to the ingury of this peoplePresident Young said I have no doubt but that thing could be done& we could take our young men into the lodge but then I would askewhat Good could it do, what good could result from it I think no good at all the truth is we have got to look to Lord God of Israelto sustain us & not to any institution or kingdom or people upon theEarth Except the kingdom of God, and I ask no odds of any man or set of men beneath the heavens Except the Lord and his saints 
 Aug. 19, 1860G. Q. Cannon said he was asstonished to come back & see howcheerful & youthful the people looked & Esspecially the presidency after passingthrough so much trouble He said he had herd Numbers say of the worldthat there was some overruling providence that had sustained this peoplethrough the war and they could not understand it. W. Woodruffsaid Brother Cannon should have seen President Young in the midst ofthe excitement when it was Expected evry hour that a message wouldarive with the tidings from the mountains that the blow was struck & bloodhad began to flow then President Young was calm & serene happy and cheerful the spirit & power of God surrounded him like aHalo of Glory and it would comfort a mans heart to go into his presence.

Helikes to live with this people & thinks we have the best organization in the world 
 26 ^1860^President Young brought a figure upon this subject He said if a manwho had been alway acquainted with the tropical fruit was to meetwith an Indian who had never seen or heard of the fruit the white men would say to the Indian do you not hanker for pineapple, oranges & Banannas the Indians say no I never saw any I do not know what they are it is so with Dr Anderson & othermen they have never tasted of the fruits of the spirit & power of God & do not know what it is and hence they have no faith in it O Pratt Prayed & D.

He visited another Lake about 90 miles wide & over 100 long this was not surrounded with Bluffs like the others He did not go around this as it would have taken 500 men to have fought there way through amongthe natives He had but 150 men with him and the native chiefs think any stranger that visits them was out of honor to them & would not let them visit other tribes without a forighting for it He came near loosing his life in a dugout on the large lake. in speaking of the Mahomitan religion He said it was not a new religion but a refermation of the Christian religion opium is sold in that country for its weight in silver. There was a drug the people took which they received as a luxery they would set Back to Back so as to not see Each others faces if one sneezed all would sneeze. He spoke of the custom of the Druses their religion caused them to bath often and they are temperate while many of the Christians of that country are intemperate and filthy which causes them to be weaker than the Druses which gives the Druses the advantage over the Christians in war &cwhile speaking of the U.S. armey here President Young said if Col Johnson had staid in this Territory a few years he would have known more than he does now, he planted his army in thecenter of the settlements so the people would protect his army fromthe Indians, if he would had made his settlements in Cash Valley he would have had an outlet.

D. Ross spoke a short time the meetingwas dismissed and all the missionaries were called to meet at theHistorians office at half past 4 oclok. At 4 oclok President Young  with the Missionaries met at the Historians office. He asked the missionaries if there was any one who could not go I do notwish to oppress any one there are a plenty of Elderss who areable & willing to go no one excused himself The names werethen taken or called over to know who could fit themselves outand all were provided for. You Elders what do you think of the commandment I give you let your carriages be filled withold men and women and you pull a wheel barrow, and if theiris feble men & women put them in Hand Carts with springsand draw them in. Some of the Brethren sould not fit up &a contribution was taken up to Fit them up B Young $100, H C K $50,W Woodruff $25, John Taylor $60, F. D. Richards $30, D Spences $12, Fineas TYoung $160. Adjourned till 22nd Sept at the 70s Hall for a Blessing meeting all the Twelve should be present. President Young madesome remarks upon his commandments to the Elders He said that every 
 9th ^1860^man that had gone out on missions and turned merchants theyare not worth a groat, when they come home they are empty in spirit and become beggarly poor. Brother P. P. Pratt began thisin England and He was beggarly poor, for years & Erastus Snowand F. D. Richards came home merchants and they are poorand Orson Pratt came home in carriages & with silks and satins and he is poor. He spoke in the power of God and sharply rebuked the Twelve & Elders for their spirit of speculation which they indulged in and when such Elders get home they have not the spirit of God in them. He was followed by George F Hendry. Elders Erastus Snow O. Pratt, & H. C. Kimball all bore testimony to what President Young had said was true. H. C. Kimball refered to P. P. Pratt being in merchandizeand would not trust him $5 and Yearsley said that He would not trust H. C. Kimball nor God Almighty. We shalllive while millions of such men are dead He bore testimony in the power of God to what President Young had said.He said that the Elders had been like blood suckers from Here to England, and it is time for it to be stoped, andlet the women alone & not be corting them but let themalone. many bring home women & wandt the president to soon seal a woman to him this will soon kill him President Young then spoke to Orson Pratt & said that the Book debt was the worst trouble the Saints handsd to contend with for 6 years. Orson Pratt has done more to make that debt than any other man so many Books are forced upon the people and they are forced to take them or they will not be fellowshiped notw stop publisheding & geting your portraits taken & fill the kingdom with them & make the people pay for them, this keeps the people poor and keeps them from Emigrating. BrotherOrson Pratt hade made some remarks saying that he had used his own means and not any of the means of the Church He had gotit all by his publications. President Young said it all coome out of the poor saints Just as much as tho he had begged it. J V. Long reported President Youngs speech which pierced the bones & marrow 
 9 ^1860^and thoughts and intents of the Hearts of the Twelve Apostle and others ofwho were present He spoke the truth in the name of the Lord with great power & sharpness and power He reproved the sins of the Twelve & others in a manner which made them feel by the power of God the necessity of walking uprightly before the Lord, & to be free from all sin. At the adjournmentof the meeting we repaired to the Prayer room. Erastus snow Prayed & JohnTaylor was mouth. (See privat Journal.)September 10, 1860 ~ Monday10th I spent the day in the office the forenoon Journalizing and the afternoonlooking over the mail matter for news but found but little.September 11, 1860 ~ Tuesday11 I spent the day Journalizing and compiling History I came in at 3 oclkP.M. Found President Young in the office & T. Bullock reading to him the political papers at the close of the reading I compiled History with JaquesSeptember 12, 1860 ~ Wednesday12 I spent the fore part of the day compileing History I spent the afternoon watering my garden.September 13, 1860 ~ Thursday13 I spent the day compiling History I attended the Bishops meeting [FIGURE] President Young was Present and delivered one of the most powerful discourses I ever herd from his mouth unto the children of men there wasno reporter Present nor clerk to keep minutes. Brother Calder wrote some minutes & I reported the following synopsis of the presidents remarks Meeting opened by prayer by W. Woodruff Bishop Hunter called the roll & not more than half the Bishops present a part of the councillors. BishopHunter then called for teams to draw Adobies & sand. Also Enquired if there was houses to rent, several was reported. A recommendatinwas read from one of the Brethren as school teacher. President Young then arose and said there is a good deal I want tosay to the Bishops but I dont think I shall say much to you to night I would liked to have seen all the Bishops here to night many are absent. I shall speak of those things which we want now. The Bishopsare the men more than others to attend to the Business of the Churchin the Stakes of Zion. I have said a good deal at times against the Bishops perhaps more than they thought was right. But I now will tell you what I want. We have missionaries going abroad upon their missions we are all acquainted with the situation & Locations of theis country. The revelations says take neither purse nor scrip. that is go without taking food or money, now this revelation wias given to the Twelve inJerruselem a city filled with the wealth of the Nations it is like 
 13, ^1860^giving the same commandment to Elders in New York City but it cannot be Expected that Elders will start from this city to walka thousand miles to settlements without food or to kill there game by the way. But they have got to be supplyed with means to go to there Field of Labor. I now want to take up a collection next sunday& the sunday following for the missionaries who are not able to fit themselves out and I want the Bishops to see to it and attend to it. I shall take up a collection for this purpose. we are in a land of plenty we have a superabundance of means, now shall we send out those Elders to beg of the poor saints who are already bound downwith poverty to obtain all their supplies No we will not. I do not mean that this people shall stay here in their wealth and sin any longer &send out Elders to preach & beg of the poor who have not means tocome to Zion as they have done heretofore. I intend this peopleHereafter shall find means to send the Elders to their fields of Labor and if necessary to bring them back again. Our Elders have had to beg so much frotm the people that they have bound the Saints with chains of oppression, this must be stoped The Saints in Zion must take this burthen off from the poor abroad The people Here think [they] are vary good Saints but they havebut one Eye open. The Elders of Israel here in Zion have there minds upon thworldly matters and not upon the building ofup of the Kingdom of God. they will go into the stand and preach and get down and pray and promise the Lord what they will do. they will get up and and a horse trade will make them deny all they promised the Lord as the Elders advancin the Kingdom of God did I say advanc No they do not advance you will hear Elders get up in the stand and Exhortthe people not to Quarrel with their Neighbors or abuse therewives or children. Now if the Elders were living their religion& walking in the path of Duty they would consider such preaching an Insult and a disgrace to them, as they wouldbe living above such conduct. The Elders and people are asleep and there Hearts are set upon getting rich and the work ofGod is out of sight to them. Now I will say to you Bishops that I dont care a groat whether you or the people do one thing or 
 13, ^1860^not but I will warn you that if you do not go to and raiseup means to assist in sending these Elders abroad and build up the Kingdom of God. The Lord will raise up other people to do the work which you and this people are called to do. any man who holds the priesthood of God that commits sin and does not magnify that priesthood He will have to pay the penalty and He cannot Escape it. Now if the Bishops want to do their duty let them go to work & raise means enough to help the poor Saints that are going away. Orson Pratt, Erastus Snow, are poor. Brother Bywater & John L Smith & some others want some help to get away, and their families will want help after they are gone and the Bishops must see to them such men as Ormus Bates can take care of himself & others can, but those who cannot must be provided for, you may think that I am hard. But all I would ask would be for the Bishopsand this people to see the things of God & his Kingdom as I do. Butwhen I think of the situation of the Earth, and the price of the Earth which is no less than the life & Blood of the Lamb of God, and whenI think what the cost will be of the neglect of this people, their worldly mindedness and unbelif it causes me pain. what is the cost it is this Jesus Christ the Son of God our Elder Brother is at the door and wants to come in and take possession of the kingdomand reign triumphant over his foes and you wont let him,this people are shutting up every avenue so that Jesus Christ cannot come to the Earth. Can you see what it costs, it makes my heart ake (while in this part of his speach he walked the floor and his voice was like the voice of God) "all I will ask of this people isto see things as I do then they would act & not sleep. Now whatdo the Bishops know about their wards or what is going on in there wards Nothing. Let me ask a Bishop how many grog shopshave you in your wards I dont know. How many Hore Houses I dont know. How many gambling shops &c I dont know, and so it goes all through the Church some poor woman will call upon a Bishop or some man upon business in the morning the Bishop says O dont trouble me I must go to the canyon for wood I dont want to be trouble though I am your Bishop. Bishops do not magnify there calling in thes things Now many Bishops are there here to night out of the 20 wards in this city not many 
 13 ^1860^How much tithing do we receive of the people in this Territory not one bushel of wheat in a hundred which is our due, not a tithing of what we ought, and we have had to use much which we have received as tithing to build roade up provo Canyon and other places now we cannot get tithing in any thing which the people can sell for money. Now if some man would appear on these streets and offer cash for wheat, we would not get one bushel in a thousand Now there has been $500,000 dollars worth of Freight annually paid for goods brought to this Territory. in 10 years there has [been] $5000000 dollars paid for goods now how much of that had ought to come to the tithing office $500,000 dollars Now I will say toyou Bishops if you feel to lay this thing before the people I want you to say to the people Bring on your diemes shillings half dollars Dollars half, Eagles, Eagles Twenty Dollar peaces Fifty dollar peases and send these Elders to their field of Labor. I will now tell you how much the Elders in England have spent of the tithing money. They have spent $54,0470 $27,035, each year now I want this stoped. From the day that P. P. Pratt commenced Begging in England up to the present time there is not one of thatclass of Elders but what have become beggars and Hell is full ofsuch Elders and I dont care how soon the rest go there. I went there and Esstablished the work and all the means I got I spent in Emigrating the poor. I have said that I would sell evry scentsworth of property I possessed in the world for two thirds of its value and give every dime of it for Emigrating the poor saints now let any man or company of men come and Byuy my property & I well give it to Emigrat the poor, and I will begin without one cent and in 10 years I will be worth more than I am now. I will stopthis begging in England if I can and I think I can do it. you Englishmen cannot you see the poor saints starving in England and yet our Elders will beg the last cent they have got. Thissubject has pained me for years But I have never had the poweruntill now to handle it I now have the power and I will use it thank the Lord. Other remarks were made by the president. I arose and bore testimony to what President Young had said. The following are some of the remarks I maidde 
 April 25vary Edifying manner among other remarks He said "I want you to go upon your mission in the spirit of God you will do more good bybearing testimony of the work of God through the Holy Ghoost than allthe argument you can use you may take two men one may be varylearned in all the arts & siences of the day and be able to preach a Bible& a half in one serman and the other man may be ignorant of these things but be filled with the Holy Ghost let one preach by his lear[n]ing& argument the other by the Holy Ghost & the man that preaches by the Holy Goh^o^st will make ten saints whare the other will one. I do not wishby these remarks to lay one straw in the way of any of the Elders obtain-ing a knowledge of the Arts & sciences and being armed with truthful arguments upon evry subject, the Elders should sbeek diligently to obtain all knowledge in their power but they should obtain the Holy Ghost to assist them in their ministry. Unless a man can fell [feel] that he administersthe ussues [issues] of life & death unto the people he does not magnify his callingas an Elder in Israel if a man [is] called of God to preached the Gospel and he preaches it in the demonstration of the Holy Ghost according tohis calling it will prove a savior of life unto life or of Death unto deathto those who hear.Some of you are going to visit your relationsnow when you get whare your relatives are dont set down at your Ease & give up preaching but remember that you are on a mission and you should improve your timeYou will have all manner of Evil spoken against you and all I ask of you and all that God or angels willask of you is that not one word spoken against you will be true but that it shall all be fals and I want you for your own sake, my sake & for the sake of Christ & the Kingdom of God that the wicked shallhave no cause to speak one word of Evil against you And if youwill go & not let down one thread of your calling but do your dutyin all things I would feel perfectly safe in warranting all of you a safe return home some have died while on there missions this is lamentable For it is unnecessary For if an Elder goes & does his duty in all things there is no neccesity of his Falling by the way. another subject I wish to speak upon & that is about your beging upon your missions. I do not wish you to beg but trust in gGod & not have it to say when you come home that you have robed any one or taking any thing unjustly from any one go & preach the gospel Faithfully & trust in God and He will give you all he has for you 
 25th April 1860There is another vary important subject which I wish to speak of & thatis the Temptation you will have From women this has caused the down fall of more Elders in this Church than any other thing there is some Elders who go on there missions all there lives and keep them-selves clean & pure all there lives others comes home and are shady there countenance Falls they cannot look you strait in the Eye they fallen in the snare. Joseph said in speaking to the First Twelve that they would have to watch against this snare For they would havemore trouble From this source than any other now let evry woman alon while you are gone, dont lay your hand upon any woman, but keep yourselves clean some have to bring a group of women with them they have to get a new dove into there house while they are gone let those things alone while abroad, but what is done upon that subject let it be done here. While abroad you will meet with many who will want to debate with you but dont contend with anyman but make a Bargin with such men & tell them if they have one truth which you do not possess tell them you will exchange ten Errors for it if you will show me I have them.I shall meet with you tomorrow you will have a letter of Instruction redad & I want you to observe it you will have prayers in camp there must be no swareing nor contention you may think this or that one does wrong but impute it to the Error of the Head & not the Heart I have Appointed Joseph W Young to preside over the camp going down I dont want you to Hurry him those teams have got to come back again, you will be carried with your provisions Free But I want you to assist the Teamsters about getting along. Ther must notbe any abuse of cattle I have never permitted this in any company I have had controll of I will never permit a man to abuse a dumb brute yoaked or Harnessed up that cannot get away or speak for himself but if a man wants to abuse any thing let him strikena strong man that will knock him down in return but dont abusea dumb animal. At the close of the remarks Erastus Snow dismi-ssed the meeting I walked home with Capt Gibson took supper with him & conversed with him for some two hours concerning his mission Former life. He remarked that the 25 April was a vary Notable day to him He Escaped From his prison in the Island of Java He arived home at South Caralina & and met with a warm 
 25 1860demonstration of his townsmen on the 25 April. He had now been set apart & Blessed under the hands of 2 of the Twelve Apostles (W Woodruff being mouth) to go upon a mission to preach the gospel to the United Statesupon the 25 April He felt much pleased with his blessing & wished me to write it off & forward it to himApril 26, 1860 ~ Thursday26th I spent the Forepart of my day writing in this Journal.

I wish to say a word about the thieveing thatis going on in this Territory I say stop this stealing that is going on here and if you cannot stop it in any other way stop it by stoping their breath I would say the best way to stop both white & red men From stealing is to take them with a rwrite of Habeas Corpus by led fromthe muzzle of a gun that will settle matter & stop all Expens when an Indian steals your property you want to kill him while hehas been taught to steal all his life but you will let the white mango who has always been taught not to steal & he knows better.

He said I dreamed that I was in a room with Phineas Young and I saw a smooth faced young man setting beside him I asked Phineas who it was He replyed this is the saviour, (I did not believe it) I smiled and said I wonder if he is the saviour Phineas said he was I thenasked the person if he was the Savoor He said he was. I asked himif [so] how long have you been here He said 14 days. I said have youa wife, He said yes this is my wife pointing to a woman dressed in black with a thick dark veil over her face said this is my wife I thought it a funny idea I felt that I wanted to prove him soon the woman vanished and he turned into a woman himself then I awoke and the thought came to me that it was a representation of young Joseph & Emma Smith who had undertook to Esstablished a church, but it was upon fals groungd & principles in oposition to the true Church of Christ. I was satisfied he was not the saviour[FIGURE] I received a letter from Mrs Woodruff who stated that sister Cunningham was quite sick & wished to know when he was coming home.

L. Campbell. A Carrington read the conference minutes and a sermon of President Young delivered at the conference in Nauvoo Oct 1844. The minutes of this sermon was compiled or written & furnished by Wm Clayton which done great injustice to the subject. President Young gave a vary interesting and instructive discourse upon the organization of the Church the powerof the priesthood the authority & duties of the various Quorums from the deacon to the presidency But Brother Clayton in reporting it gavea small portion of the sermon in detached sentences which gave an Entire different meaning from what was intended Hence President 
 27th ^1860^millions of years before our God was he also had to occupy an Earthlike ourselves and we shall find it out at some period and this is all the mystery there is about it & if we are faithful we in our turn shall be Exalted and become Gods, and there will be nomiystery about it when we understand itO Hyde said I am satisfied that I have used a good deal of Philosiphywhis is not true but that is all done away with, and I did not thinkI should meet with the Prejudices of Potawatamie here to nightPresident Young said if you bring Potawatamie with you you mustexpect to meet it. O Hyde said that he did not preach in Grants-ville as Brother Joseph Young reported he did Brother Joseph was not Present and he has been misinformed concerning it E. T. Benson Explained the way O Hyde did preach He compaired the reseurrectionto taking a Journey around the world we travel all day stop at a station at night lie down and sleep at night arise in the morning& continue our Journey through another day & so on. So at theEnd of this life we sleep in the grave till the morning of the resurre-ction we then arise and continue our Journey. Brother Benson also said I do not preach things which I do not know I keepin shallow water I wish to teach the people those things which theycan understand, and those things we cannot understand I do not trouble myself about, I know it is my duty to sustain the presidentof this Church if I do not respect the President of this Church and beliehis word and I set my self up against him I am under condemnation I would as lives cut off my right Hand, if he speaks tous we must believe him and obey him. I mean to do it.Erastus Snow said President Young has put words in my mouthso that I can convey what I want. we are apt to say many thingswhich we do not mean & we injure ourselves. I cannot see thingsin the same light that Orson Pratt does but when President Young hastaught doctrin it has always tasted good to me. I do not wish toknow any more than God wishes me to.Orson Pratt said I will speak upon this subject I have notspoaken but once in the Tabernacle since conference I thenspoke upon the revelations in the Doctrins & Covenants concerning the Father& son & their atributes I spoke upon those attributes of the Father & sonI spoke of the Attributes of the Saints I gave my views upon the attributes 
 27 ^1860^of God I sincerly believed what I preached, how long I have believedthis doctrin I do not know but it has been for years I have publishedit in the seer, I spoke of a plurality of Gods, in order to worshipthis God I said that I adored the atributes wharever I found themI was honest in this matter * I would not worship a god or Tabernaclethat did not possess Atrtributs if I did I should worship IdolsI have thaught this doctrin. Now the reson I worship the Fatheris because in him is combined the attributs if he had not those attributs I would not worship him any more than I would thischair. I cannot see any difference between myself and PresidentYoung. If you had told me what you worshiped him for youwould have told me somthing, but now I can see no differencebetween us. I wish to Explain Now Jesus said I am in the Father& the Father in me. Now I do not suppose that the Father is inthe son & the Son in the Father in the Tabernacle, but in the spiritand Attributes, truth light power &c. we are told that the son repr-esents the Father in Attributs &c I called upon the Brethren to come to this meeting to settel this But I must have somthing more than a declaration of President Young to convince me I must have EvidenceI am willing to take President Young as a guide in most things but not in all. President Young does not profess to have revelations inall things. I am not to loose my agency I have said many things which President Young says is Fals. I do not know how it isI count president Young Equal to Joseph Iand Joseph Equalto President Young I find things in Josephs Revelations that govern me I would as liefer believes Joseph asBrigham. When Joseph teaches one thing & Brighamseems to teach another contrary to Joseph (I say seems to)I believe them as Joseph has spoken them and as the Apostlespeaks of them I do not know God ownly tby his Atributes, andthat God who has the most Atributes I worship, I worship but oneGod, and God does not dwell in me ownly by his Atributes Ihave spoken plainly I would rather not have spoken so plainlybut I have No excuses to make President Young said I oughtto make a confession But Orson Pratt is not a man to make aconfession of that I do not Believe. I am not going to crawl toBrigham Young and act the Hypocrite and confess what I do 
 27th ^1860^not Believe I will be a free man. President Young condems my doctrinto be fals I do not believe them to be fals I believe President Youngto be sincere in sayin that my doctrin is fals. I did not Believethe doctrin fals which I published in the Seer in England. it hasbeen said we should let those things sleep. But you do not let them sleepIf I had thought while in England that President Young worshipeda God without attributes I would not have written what I did((The above remark was an unkind cut in Orson Pratt he should not have said it))But I do not believe it yet I will not act the Hypocrite it may cost me my fellowship But I will stick to it if I die to night I would say OLord God Almighty I believe what I say.Elder John Taylor spoke at some length and tried to convince Orson Prattof his Error. President Young said Orson Pratt has started out uponfalse premises to argue upon his foundation has been a fals one all thetime and I will prove it false you have been like a mad stoubernMule, and have taken a fals position in order to accuse me you haveaccused me of worshiping a stalk or stone or a dead Body withoutlife or attributes you never herd such a doctrin taught by me or anyleader of the Church it is as false as Hell and you will not hear thelast of it soon. you know it is false Do we worship those attributes Nowe worship God because he has all those Attributes and is the dispensurof them and because he is our Father & our God. Orson Pratt puts downa lie to argue upon he has had fals ground all the time to nightThare never was a time or Eternity but what a God did exist, anda God that had children upon the same principle that childrenare now begotton, and I was begotton by the God I worship who reigns in the heavens and I shall also in my turn reign as a God & so will youO Hyde said to O Pratt, My opinion is not worth as much to me as my fellowship in this ChurchPresident Young said Michael was a resurrected Being and helef[t] Eloheem and kcame to this Earth & cwith an im[mor]tal Body & continuedso till he partook of Earthly food and begat children who were mortal(keep this to yourselves) then they died. A Carrington spoke uponthe subject a short time & made some useful remarksPresident Young spoke upon the subject of O. Pratt laying dow falsprinciple to work upon That principle if carried out would place 
 27th ^1860^us in a position that when a man got a fulness of the Attributs of God they would have to worship themselves. But if we worship God we worship him because he possesses all the Attributes and dispenses them to the children of men all these Attributes are the servants of God they serve his purposes and are at his command President H C Kimball Followed President Young and said Brother Orson Pratt has withstood Joseph and he has withstood Brother Brigham many times and he has done it to night and it made my Blood chill, it is not for you to lead but to be leadd by him. You have not the power to dictate but to be dictated W. Woodruff arose and said Brother Orson PrattI wish to ask you one or two questions, you see that the spirit and doctrin which you possess ins entirely in a oposition to the First PresidencyThe Quorum of the Twelve, and all who are present this evening and it chills the Blood in our veins to hear your words & feel your spirit should not this be an Evidence to you that you are wrong what would become of the Quorum of the Twelve if we all felt as you do we should all go to Hell in a pile together. You say you are honest inthe course you are pursueing, I wish to ask you if you was honest when you said that if you had known that President Young worshiped a God without life or Attributes that you would not have written what you did (O Pratt said I will recall that) It was an insult to President You[n]g and the Holy Priesthood which he holds, evry man in this room who has a particle of the spirit of God, knows that President Young is a Prophet of God and that God sustains him and He has the Holy Spirit and his doctrins are true, and that he is qualifyed tolead the people and he has explained evry thing so plain this evening that a child can understand it, and yet it is no evidence to you, nothing can make an impression upon you, no argument can reach your understanding. But Brother Orson I have seen the day whenyou was in sorrow it was when you was cast out of your Quorumand out of the Church and that to in consequence of persueing the same course you are this evening, then you could both see feel &understand, then argument could reach you when you saw your glory and crown departing from you. I beg of you to reflect and not letyour will carry you to Far in these things, it would be better for us not to be able to cast up a single sum in adition and be humble before 
 27th ^1860^the Lord than to have ever so much knowledge & permit that knowledgeto lead us to destruction. There are but few men upon Earth upon whom God has bestowed such gifts, qualifications and reasoning powers as he has upon you, and he will hold you responsible for the use you make of them, and you should not make a wreck of yoursalvation for contending for things which you do not understand and I do feel at this advanced state of the Church, and late day and with the information which you possess that neither you nor your Brethren ought to be troubled with Fals doctrin Neither should you cause your Brethren to listen to such a scene of thingsas we have herd to night or to insult the president of this Churchas you have done, although you are unbending in your will to nightthe day is not far distant when you will be glad to bendto the president of this Chiurch and make reconciliation. Erastus Snow Followed and backed up the Testimony of thosewho have spoakenOrson Hyde Spoke upon the subject and said Brother Pratt hadnot got the spirit of God. He was followed By C. C. Rich who backed up the Testimony of the Twelve in saying that Orson Pratt was wrong. E. T. Benson spoke upon the same subjectand said if Brother Pratt had the confidence in President Young which he ought to have he would Feel diferent if he hadthe confidence in his Brethren which he should have I know He would feel differentPresident Young said I will tell you how I got along withJoseph I found out that God called Joseph to be a Prophet I did not do it, I then said I will leave the Prophet in the hands of that God who called and ordained him to be a Prophet He is not responsible to me and it is none of my business what He does it is for me to follow & obey him. I wonce was ashamed of one thing which I did while in Missouri in Zions Camp I got a revelation that God excepted our offering I had the samething revealed to me twice & that we should not go into Jackson Co. I named this to some of the Brethren a day or two before Joseph got a Revelation upon the same subject I felt ashamed that I named it first, I knew whare we were going and I now know that when we go to Jackson County we shall go from the west 
 27th ^1860^and I will now tell you all and you may right it down thatall my preaching by the Holy Ghost it is revelation. I told the Brother Joseph that he had given us revelation enough to lastus 20 years when that time is out I can give as good revelation as their is in the Doctrins & Covenants. "Elder Taylor saidin one of his sermons that if we walk in the light of the Lordwe should have revelations all the time." it is the light that is within you no man can live his religion without living in Revelation but I would never tell a revelation to the Church untillJoseph told it first. Joseph once told me to go to his own house to attend a meeting with him he said that He would not go withoutme. I went and Hiram Preached upon the Bible Book of Morm[on] & Covenants and said we must take them as our guide alone he preached vary lengthy untill he nearly wearied the people out when he closed Joseph told me to get up. I did so I took the Books and piled them all up on top of Each other. I then said that I would not give the ashes of a rye straw for all those books for my salvation without the living oracles I should follow and obey the living oracles for my salvation instead of any thing Els when I got through Hyrum got up and made a confession for not including the living Oracles.It may be thought strange by the Brethren that I will still fello-wship Elder Pratt after what He has said, but I shall do it. I amd determined to whip Brother Pratt into it and make him work in the harvest. Orson Pratt said if I gratifyed my feelings I had rather go into the canyon than to Preach I have got to go to Tooele to get wood for my family. President Young said I will give you a mission in Tooleele to preach & send word to the Bishop to get some men & draw up his wood Brother Pratt has no busines in the canyon the Lord does not want him there F D Richard Dismissed the meetingJanuary 28, 1860 ~ Saturday28th I spent the day in the office I met with the Twelve in the prayer circle 29Orson Pratt met with us he did not dress but said he wanted to be in the Society of the Twelve.

Wells who was fast recovering from his sicknesswhile speaking of the Malays President Young said that He was of theopinion that the Malays were of the seed of Abraham they went to those Islands the same as they came to this continent they areprobably of Abrams promised seed. They have a cereimony to marry for Eternity this principle shows that they obtained theirtraditions from Ancient Israel for the gentiles did not practiceit & it has been handed down among them through many Generationsuntill the present time. The Malays are a vary war like people & proud 
 March 4th ^1860^  and while in Battle rather than to be saved by one of there servants they would perish they would not owe there lives to a slave. We see a great varity of& grade of intelligence. I see right here in the midst of this people some who do not know their right hand from there left I see people freequently People who do not appear to have any underst-anding they will also increas but they will be so far behind they will never catch up, and they will never be any thing but serv-ants. Such may be saved and get a good place. President Young saidI corrected O Pratt to day. I did not say to him that God would incresincrease to all Eternity. But I said the moment that we say that God knows all things comprehends all things and has a fulness of all that He ever will obtain that moment Eternity ceases you put bounds to Eternity space & matter and you make an End and stoping place to it. The people or many say thay cannot understand thes things, this is true No man can understand the things of Eternity And Brother Pratt and all men should let the matter of the gods alone I do not understand these things Neither does any man in the flesh and we should let them alone some men profess infidelity but when they go into Eternity they willfind all they see in this life upon the Earth is ownly a similitude of what thay will find in the next world. In speaking of the subject of faith He said we will find but little faith but a good deal of belief every body has that for it is an inherant principle in all. I havelaid hands upon people when I knew they would be healed at other times I have laid hands upon people when I did not feel that way & still they were healed. I once laid hands upon a sister Lake when she said she had No faith I told her I did not care whether she had or not for I had and I knew she would be healed. I laid hands upon her & she was immiediately healed. I dont know how it is or how faith comes ownly as the gift of God I know No other way to get it. John Taylor said Joseph told him on[c]e to go & lay hands upon a person who was possessed of a Devil & cast him out and leave the house & dont speak to any person I did so & left the house without saying a word & the devil left her.  The conversation turned upon Josephs children Brother Taylor said it was a pity that Emma had such an influence over them B Young said Bless your heart the Lord watches over them& will take care of them.

We have got to be sanctified & sanctify all 
 July 13, 1865the Earth & we have got to begin by sanctifying our ownhearts first & then spread out. How many of the children of this people are Entitled to the Holy Priesthood & the Blessings of Abraham all who are born after their parents have received their Endowments & are sealed & all others will have to be adopted to their parents. All who want the Blessings of AbramIsaac & Jacob go & get your Endowments before you get married. then all your children will be heirs to the priesthood. their is no son has a right to the Priesthood & heirship unless their parents had their Endowments before they were born such must be adopted to theirParents or they have no right to the heirship. Let no youth get married untill they get their Endowments & get sealed at the Altar. If young men knew what was for their good they would go hundreds of miles to get marriedright before they would do as many have. Our boys whoare guided by a right hand will be mighty men ^of God^ in the Earth. The Lord instituted Polygamy to raise up a royalPriesthood a kingdom of Priest, it is an institution of heavenall the blessings that are sealed upon us will do us no good unlesswe live for them {Remember son Wilford} The Lord has in store for his children Every good thing the heart can desire in righteousness. The Celestial kingdom will be on this Earth to us when we are celestial with the Earth. The Earth when it fell went Millions of miles from the presence of God & when it returns back it will go millions of miles from its present position to whare it came from. Whare is the Mechanic that has knowlede Enough to lay the first cornor stone of the New Gerrusalem {God might reveal this to someone}Ancient Israel the seed of Abraham was not found worthyto keep the Melchezedeck Priesthood, what then is to be done.The Lord said I will in the Last days raise up a generation of Men, a royal Priesthood who would come forth to redeem the death of Israel as well as the Liveing. This is our work ye latter DaySaints. Then rise up ye Latter Day Saints of God & do the workof God required at your. The Lord Acknowledged Ancient Israelbecause they were the best there was, but there was not light Enough 
 July 13 1865to light one match. The breath of this people would sanctify the Campof Israel as it was Anciently. And now I will say to all the people get your Endowments & be sealed, then your children Will be legal heirsto the priesthood & Birth right if this is not the case with you yourchildren will have to be sealed to you.

Now here is the Presidency & Twelve thereis no two of them that look alike or preach alike, their minds run in different channels yet they preach by the same spirit 
 Sept 17 1865There is not a Better or handsomer set of men to be foundupon the Earth than they are. I am the most homely man among them, so they let me say about what I am a mind tobut if I get much out of the way, President Young is here to correct me as it is his place to correct all the Errors of the Church.It is a hard Matter for the Lord to Esstablish his Church& kingdom upon an Earth whare the devil has power & dom-inion & reigns over the hearts of the children of men & it would be an impossibility for the Lord to build up his kingdomupon this Earth if he could not get some element, even someof the children of men to work with him, and this has beenthe difficulty since the creation of the world, that the Devil hasruled over the hearts of the children of men to that degree that the Lord could not find men Enough upon the Earth who wouldsubmit for the Lord to rule over them, & lead them sufficient to buildup his kingdom to remain upon the Earth. Even in the days ofEnoch the Lord had to take him & his company off from the Earth because they could not live upon it. The Lord has now set his hand one more for the Last time to Esstablish his kingdomupon the Earth to remain, to overcome the Devil & his works &subdue the Earth, & the Lord has decreed that this should be accomplishedand the Lord has taken all the pains in his power to Accomplish itHe has brought forth the best spirits that Ever dwelt in Hispresence, to come forth upon the Earth to work with him in theaccomplishment of this work. Even Joseph Smith was retained in the Heavens for seven thousands years to come forth in this day to lay the foundation of this Church & kingdom to be trown down no more forever, nor to be given in to the hands of another people. The same is the case with the Presidency, Twelve& many others in this Church & kingdom & the Lord has senthis Angels to watch over them from the day they were born untill now, to presevrve them from the power of the devil who has sought there destruction from the beginning Andwe have visited the Nations of the Earth, for the last thirty yearsto gather together the seed of Ephraim, the best spirits that dwell upon the Earth into these vallies of the Mountains to 
 1865assist in esstablishing this great & last kingdom of ourGod upon the Earth to remain forever, & the Lord Almightyis inspiring his servants with the spirit of his work, &the Holy Priesthood, & is arming them with power to accom-plish his purposes upon the Earth. Joseph Smith was the promisedseed to come forth to lay the foundation of the kingdom, see whathe has Accomplished. He labored but 14 years, 2 Months, & 18 daysfrom the time He first organized the Church of Christ upon the Earth, then He sealed his Testimony with his blood and all his Father's family died as Marters & will be crowned in the presence ofGod (Except William, if he had been a good man he would have  been in the spirit world with his family Fathers family long agobut he has not been fit to live or die) Joseph the Prophet during his short labor laid the foundation of this great kingdom that Daniel saw. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] He organized the Church & Kingdom with a full & complete organization, sent the gospel in its fullness & gloryto the nations of the Earth, gathered tens of thousands of Saints built Temples & founded cities, gave Endowments to the Twelve Apostles Elders & Saints & sealed all the Keys of the kingdom of God uponThe Twelve Apostles & Brigham Young as there President.President Young is before you, look at him, he has the Appearance of a Man about 40 years of Age, He is 64. He has travelled more Miles, Attended More Meetings, Preached More sermons,delivered unto the people more of the word of the Lord, revelationprophesy, principle, sealed more blessings upon the heads of the children of Men, United more in the Marriage Covenant, Administered more of the ordinances of the House of God, Attendedto more branches of business, had more wives, Raised up morechildren, created more recreation for the youth to keep them out of the clutches of the devil, danced more cotilions, Built more Temples, Tabernacles, Meeting Houses, School Houses, dwell-ings & made more improvements & done more for the salv-ation of Man, & the redemption of the Earth than any man that Ever dwelt in flesh during the space of 30 years,He has brought more to pass & Accomplished more in 30 years than the Early patriarchs did in 500 years 
 Sept 17, 1865Why is all this, it is because the Lord is agoing to make a short work on the Earth, in the last days, & cut his work short in righteous-ness. He is inspiring his servants with the power of God & thespirit of his work, & a desire to build up his kingdom & MountZion as Men have Never before been inspired. This great & mighty work is put into your hands to perform ye saints of latter days. No greater work can be given into the handsof Men in the flesh. Then rise up ye saints of God & do thework required of you & the Lord will work with you, sustain you & redeem you & give you power to Accomplish allthat has been promised through the Mouth of all the Holy Apostles& Prophets since the world began which may God grant for Christ sake AmenG A Smith Dismissed the Meeting Afternoon Prayer By F.

President Kimball sealed 7 couple W. Woodruff 22 couple G A. Smith buried a child to day it snowed and rained through most of the dayThe following is a synopsis of Presidents Youngs remarks on the 30, at the Funeral of sister Ivins"On such occasions as this I can say that I have many reflectionwe are subject to pain, sickness & death yet we cling to life. when a 
 1863Person dies all we can do for them is to bury them decently we cannot  preach to the Dead. It is right that we should cling to life that we may live to do our Duty, to build up the kingdom of God but we should not cling to the world or to set our hearts upon the things of the world we should live Every day so that we should be satisfied with our-selves at night it will be an Evidence that the Lord is satisfied with us we should seek to do our duty day by day. Brother Joseph in his remarks said that He wished we had the faith we on[c]e had. I see the power of God manifest around me Every day. Joseph laid hands with me yesterday upon one of my wives who was vary sick & it seemed as though she could not live an hour & she was healed right up & thousands of the saints who are now alive would now have been in there graves if it had not been for the Exercise of faith in the midst of the saints. we have in our bodies the seeds of Death & our secret Enemy takes every advantage He can to destroy our lives from off the Earth. many of the children are taken away As to Sister Ivins she Appeared to be ripe she was in years. Whare has she gone she is in Paradise, in the world of spirits whare is it, It is in this world & on this Earth I do not think sister Ivins is far off she may be in this room we have not to go out of this room to find the Lord, He is in all places by his influence. I told Brother Orson Pratt when He said there was Empty space if he would show me where it was I would show him one place where the Lord was not. All men will have to pass through the ordeal of Death. Jesus Christ went through the same & all men will have to go through the same. Our bodies go to the dust where they will lie untill they are raised up clothed with Immortality we shall meet Sister Ivins in the Resurrectionshe has been kindly treated by her children & all the family and I feel to Bless them for it I have never met with Sister Ivins but what she manifested a good kind contented spirit, we all want to be prepared for that which is to come, we should Exercise faith for the devils wicked men & Nations & all Hell are triying to destroy the Latter Day Saints & the Kingdom of God. We have the seeds of death within us & the devils take the advantage of us & try to destroy us in our weakness. I would rather have the faith of the gospel than 
 1863the gold of the world. I know the feelings of the people, they might have the Loright of the Lord but they are seeking for gold & will not do as they shouldI know the feelings of the people where they are Justified before the Lord & where they are not, we have to bear with them chastize them, then comfort them &c, and do the Best we can with them I know the standing of this people before the Lord all the time I do not say much to them. I do not tell them all I know. May God Bless you amenNovember 1, 1863 ~ SundayNov 1st 1863 SundayI attended my Prayer Circle in I was mouth & Edward Hunter Prayed.

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'SJOURNALFOR 1864 
 January 1, 1864 ~ FridayJan 1st 1864 This is the commencement of a new Year I have lived to see 56 New Years And I have kept a daily Journal for the last thirty years of my life and in some measure the life of others. I have written many sermons and teachings of the Prophets Joseph Smith & Brigham Young & of other Apostles and Elders. I have watched the signes of the times for many years, and the fulfilment of Prophesy. And I am satisfied that there are great & mighty Events at our doors among which are great wars, Famines, Pestilence, Earthquakes, stormes, & tempests, the overthrow of Republics,Nations, Kingdoms, & thrones, the opening of the seals and the Pouring out of the Plagues upon Great Baybylon in fulfillment of Daniel, The Revelator John, & Joseph Smith and all Prophets who have spoken of the last days. [##Daniel 11##] [##Revelation ##] Thelast three years have been vary important in the History of the United States. The union has been dissolved and A Bloody war has ben raging for three years, and the spirit of God is being withdrawn from the Nation and the wicked are slaying the wicked and the land is being deluged in Blood and great destructin awaits the Nation and there are great Events await all Nations and the way is preparing for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and his coming will overtake the world as a thief in the night. [##1 Thessalonians 5:2##] 1864 will be an Eventful year and so will all the following years untill the Coming of the savior. The Lord is watching over the interest of Zion and sustaining his Kingdom upon the Earth and Preparing the way for the return of his Saints to Jackson County Mo to build up thewaste places of Zion Jackson County have been Entirely cleared of its inhabitants during the year 1863. Which is one of the greatest miracles manifest in our day, and those who have driven the saints out of Missouri & spoiled them are in there turn now driven out and spoiled and there is much distress throughout all the land where the saints have been persecuted. And the judgments of God will continue upon the whole Nation untill the Blood of the prophets is avenged

 January 11, 1864 ~ MondayJan 11th 1864[FIGURE] I called upon Brother Burton & then I called at the Court House and had another interview with Jason Luce who is sentencedto die tomorrow. He still feels sure that He will not die. he thinks that he has the testimony of the spirit of the Lord, that He will live & not die. He said that he was innocent of many thingsthat the people thought he was guilty off He said that he had never killed any person or had any hand in the death of any person except Rhodes & Bunting & said that he could not fell that he was guilty of murder in the death of Either of themHe had killed them in self defence He said Wm Hickman had advised him to do many things that made his flesh crallwl but he had not followed Hickmans advise in these things He told the Jailors (which I did not Hear) that Hickman once asked him to go & knock an old man in the Head for no other purpose ownly to obtain an old mare that wasnot worth more than $30. And He feels that Wm Hickman has betrayed him and done him much injury & he looksupon Hickman as a vary bad man. He said he would liketo see me tomorrow. He thought to day was the time appointedfor his Execution untill I told him it was tomorrow. I went to the council & spent the afternoon & attended to the business of the day And in the Evening I again called upon Jason Lucein company with John Sharp, T. B. Stenhouse R. Burton & many others. G. D. Watt being present acted as reportinger in taking an account of what Jason Luce would reveal unto us in his last moments. I called upon Governor Reed & asked him if he would commute Jason Luce sentence to the Penet-entiary foor m life as Hickman had held out this promiseto Luce. Soon Hickman & Wilford Luce came in for their answer & Mr Reed told them He could do nothing in thepremises that He considered that He would be commitingcrime to change the sentence of Luce unless he had better ground than any thing He had seen. So when I arived at the prision in the Evening I told Jason Luce there was no chance for him to live & I wished him to prepare to die. Hethen spent more than an hour giving us an accunt of what 
 Jan 11, 1864He had done & what he knew. He said in the case of Drown &Arnold that Hickman was responsible for their death. He killedthem with the help of one or two others. He said Wm A Hickmanrobed Carpenter's store took the goods in his waggon & carriedthem to Huntingtons & from Huntingtons to his house over Jordon & then told Furguson if he would kill Carpenter He would clear him that He should not lyie in Jail one day Furguson killed Carpenter & was Hung for it & Hickman made him believethat he would be liberated up to the last minute. Luce said that Hickman Murdered [blank] for no other purpose ownly to obtain his gold watch & money & thinks he has the watch yet. He said that Hickman was at the head of a Band of thieves they have stolen as high as 100 Head of cattle at a time fromCamp Floyd & gone ount onto the prairie & divided them & taken them to different parts of the Territory. Luce also said thatHickman had many men around him that Had to be fed & that men under him would go onto the range & drive up a Beef& kill & Eat it & sell the Hides or make them into Larretts or throw them away as the case might be without any regard to whom might be the owners. Luce said that Hickman hadbeen his ruin and the ruin of others and in all thes thingsHe had carried his point by declairing that President BrighamYoung hagd given him council to do all these things (which is a cursed lie) Luce made many other remarks which was reported by G. D. WattJanuary 12, 1864 ~ Tuesday12 [FIGURE] At Eleven oclok I called at the prision & was with the prisioner untill a few moments before his ExecutionHis Mother Brothers wife & 5 children visited him last night also this morning.

 1862 1862 Has past and left its trace upon the Historians Record. It has been a vary important year it has fulfilled the Historians predictions & the predictions of the prophets (seethe last page of this record written ithe last day of Dec 1861) There has been more blood shed, & lives lost in the United States in the battles between the North & South in 1862 thanthere was in the Revolutionary war & the war of 1812 with Great Brittian. The most Bloodydy battles were faught atthe following places Mill Springs, Pea Ridge, Fort Donellson,Pittsburgh landing, Fair Oaks, 7 days battle before Richmond, Cedar Mountain or Bulls run, Antietam, Corinth, and Fredricksbugh. In these ten battles alonethe number would not fall much short of half a Million of men who were killed & wounded and then there has been scores of Miner battles which have slain many thousands. Many also have been slain by pest-ilence there has also been great destruction of property by fire & otherwise. The spirit of Disunion seems to incr-ease among the people. There has been a great want of Breadin England and France during the past year caused in a greatmeasure by closing up the southern ports which has stoped the importation of cotton. France has opened a war with Mexico and there is a great lack of confidence through-out the Earth betwen man & man and between all the Nations of the Earth, there are many widows and orphans and much morning & Lamentation through the Land in conseq-uence of the much blood which has been shed during the past year but the End is not yet, but ownly Just commenced peace is taken from the Earth and the wicked are inspired to slay the wicked. While these things are going on the Saints are gathering home to Zion to build up the kingdom of God, then the Lord may reign over his Saints while Satan rules overhis own Dominion. There has been Near 5000 Saints gathered into these vallies during the past year. The Templefoundation has been taken up in part & relaid & many impro-vements have been made, & the Blessings of God have been upon Zion

 Jan 11th 1863^[FIGURE]^ President Young Preached in the Afternoon. He read the Vision given to Joseph Smith & Sidney Rigdon then He preached upon it He spoke of the various glories & the different characters who would occupy them He said all children who died in childhood would go to the celestial kingdom and thereir Mothers if they do not keep the celestial layw will not go whare there children are & will never see them again but the children will be given to others. He said many interesting things. I met with theTwelve at 5 oclok for prayer O Pratt Prayed E. T. Benson wasMouth. I attended Meeting at the 14 ward school House O. PrattPreached A vary singlar discourse. He spoke of building the [FIGURE] New Jerrusalem in Missouri said we must not build log Houses as the city would be translated & they would be Everlasting Habitations & would remain forever He spoke of the starry Heavens He did not think the sun or any star which mortal Eye could see were celestial Bodies but as soon as a world became celestial it could not be seen by man no morethan a spirit could be seen or a Resurrected body by mortal Man. in speaking of the creations of God He said they could not be numbered and to illustrate it take a cubit inch of fine sand & with a magnifying glass number the millions of particles of sand in the cubicinch then multiply the cubic inches in our globe then multiply the cubic inch of one Million of Millions of worlds and thiswould not be the begining of the creations of God and yet his curtains are stredched out still & from all the creations of God He had taken the Zion of God into his own bosom. He referd to different Asstronemers who had in ages past marked upon there maps the starry heavens & many of those fixed stars had since been removed, & could not be seen & he believed that when this Earth was consumed by fire & reorga-nized & became celestial that it could not be seen by theinhabitants of any planet in our solar system, or by any Except a celestial body. The Zion of God must be a vast body if it contained a Zion from all the creations which God had made. Many remarks were made by professor Prattand He carried our minds so far from Home it took me till midnight to get back

Many may not be able to tell whywe are in this capacity. I do not think that you see this thingas it is. Our organization will be kept up. We may not domuch at present in this capacity yet what we have don orshall do will have its Effect. Our constitution which we sent toWashington has been closely scanned by the members of Congressall of our moves here are feared by the nations of the EarthEsspecially the United States. This body of men will give lawsto the Nations of the Earth. We meet here in our seconed annualLegislature & I do not care whether you pass any laws this seasonor not But I do not wish you to loose one inch of ground you 
 Jan 19 1863have gained in your Organization but hold fast to it forthis is the kingdom of God and we are the friends of Godand you will find that much will grow out of this organiza-tion But I will say without the inspirations & revelations ofGod our acts are of no use. We are called the State Legislaturebut when the time comes we shall be called the kingdom of GodOur Government is going to peaces and it will be like waterthat is spilt upon the ground that cannot be gathered if wedo not take care of ourselves no one will take care of usWe are the best of any people on the Earth, and there is nopeople as well off as this people on the Earth for light & theknowledge of God. In 1857 we said to 7000 troops stopand they stoped had there been but 500 like these troops herewe should have let them come in for they would not havedone any harm it is our business to take care of ourselvesif we see the Enemy coming it is our duty to prepare forit. I can do better to never trade again in my life with awicked man. I will name one thing. I built a theatre heremyself. some wanted the Armey to come here I do not, andsince the Armey got up a Theatre for themselves we have beencrouded to the full. I will be richer in the End if the wickeddo not come nigh. I do not care whether you sit oneday or not. but I do not want you to loose any part of thisGovernment which you have organized, for the time will comewhen these men will give laws to the Nations of the EarthJoseph Smith organized this Government before in Nauvooand He said if we done our duty we should prevailover all our Enemies. we should get all things ready &when the time comes we should let the water onto the wheeland start the machine in MotionPresident Kimball made a short address said He rememberedwell what Joseph Smith said upon the organization of thiskingdom. He said if we done what was right we shouldbe sustained by the power of God and the Holy Ghost. we haveto go step by step. The words of the prophet will be fulfilled uponthe Earth and many of us will live to see the kingdom of God

Smith F. D. Richards & W. Woodruffof the Twelve, & a large congregation of the Saints President YoungPreached. The following is a synopsis of his remarksI can say to Brother Smoot & family that they have not athousandth part the reason to regret or grieve in this bereave-ment that other parties have who have froward sons. I wouldrather follow all my children to the grave than to have themfroward in their wasys & witnessing them turning from the 
 June 22nd, 1863paths which are right. When our children are called to gohence. When our children are taken from us who havenot Jeperdized their chances of Salvation, we have reasonto rejoice instead of mourning. I knew this young lad, he wasa fine boy and as far as he had grown up he manifestedthe finest traits of character. he is now locked up wharehe is safe and sure of salvation Is not this a comfort?It is to me. What would have been the lads future course? Wedo not know. I do not know what will be the future course ofmy children. Do you know? I have witnessed such scenes.Ownly once in my life has my head acked. This was whenJoseph was killed, was martered. in parting with FathersMothers, wives & children is no comparison to it. When I feelas though the top of my head was coming off then I thinksumthing is the matter I felt this was for Many daysI can call to mind, those who have Endured more thanI in some things. Here sit b sits before me to day a good Father& mother who lost a son under more painful circumstancesthan this. He was murdered & his remains scattered overthe plains. We have before us a beautiful boy cut down inthe flower of youth yet we have No cause for morning, thisI do know that when our youths have lived according to ourcouncil we have No cause to mourn. It is no trial of myfaith to see my children laid in the grave But to see themJoin with the wicked, forget their duty, & become frowardthis is a trial which in part I have Experienced all I askis for grace to bear up under such trials that I may settle downin calm serenity and feel that the Lord giveth & the Lord takethaway & blessed be the name of the Lord. I have heard that Brother Smoot regretted that his son had not received his Endowmentwe are the ownly people that that can give our children theirblessings. We can do it. Others cannot this should be a sourceof consolation to us. What is there for us to grieve about. Cryingbecause God has taken our child to Heaven. Well we might cry ifthe devil had taken our child to Hell. If this family sit up &shout Hallalujah it will be more pleasing to the Lord than to sit up to cry 
 June 22, 1863Death is in the Land & we may Expect it I have freequently said whenI die give me a decent burial that is all I ask. The grave has seemedto me the sweetest place I ever looked into in my life Brother Smoot isperhaps a better man than most of us. his trials remind him that heis still in a land of sorrow & trouble. If all who bear the name of saintsget into the celestial world it will be because they purify themselves andare faithful & overcome & feel a little more the responsibility that belongsto the kingdom of God than many now do.
