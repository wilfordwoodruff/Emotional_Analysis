 July 28 [18]60 [FIGURES]  Young had to remoadle the sckeleton of the sermon before us After the   Prophet Joseph died, the Question was asked how will the Church exist  and be governed now the Prophet is dead, will the Twelve lead if so   can they get Revelation, President Young took up this subject & showed what  the privliges were of all the Saints from the least to the greatest, all saints male  and female have the privilege of revelation, of inspiration, the spirit of God   the Holy Ghost. all saints should live in the spirit of revelation. A Priest   after the order of Aaron holds the keys of the Administering of Angels   will Angels administer to a man and visit him & not reveal any thing   to him No. then if Priests can have revelation cannot Aposttles   yes. Evry part of the Melchezedeck Priesthood from an Elder to  the Presidency of the Church have a right to receive Revelations  From the face of the Lord direct without the Administration of  an Angel. Both Priesthoods are divided into classes as helps in the   government of God. Elders Belong to the Melchezedek priesthood, as Deakons   & teachers do to the Aaronic Priesthood High Priests are for Presidents  to preside over different Branches & stakes & to administer in all the   ordinances of the Melchezedek Priesthood. The Seventies are special   witnesses or& apostles to go into all the world to preach the gospel unto all   Nations to Build up the Kingdom of God, & Esstablish churches in all  the Earth under the direction of the Twelve Apostles they should call upon   the High Priest to come & preside over the Branches after they are built up   a Quorum of ^70^ Apostles when united are Equal in authority to the Quorum  of the Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles or traveling council are to be   special witnnessese of the name of Christ in all the world they are Equal in athhority  in there decissions to the Presidency of the Church they are to preside in all  the world whare the three first Presidency are not. The three first   Presidency Preside over the whole Church & administer in all the  ordinances of the Church, which consists of a President & his   two councellors the President of the Church holds the keys of the   sealing powers & his council act in concert with him in all things  should the Presidency die The Twelve could organize another Presidency   & should the Presidency & Twelve all be slain the seventies being   Equal in power & Authority to the Twelve or first Presidency could   organize both Quorums. A Bishop has two councellors there   is no difference in the authority of his councillors the 2nd has as much     
 28 July ^1860^  authority as the first. A Bishop should have his councilers with him   on the trial of a case in order to make it Legal as it takes three to make  a Quorum. The High Priest could organize the Church in all its   parts if all other Authorities were dead for they have the Melchezedek   Priesthood out of which grow all of the Higher offices of the Church   An Apostle is the highest office in the Church & kingdom of God Joseph   Smith was a Prophet Seer & Revelator before he was baptized or   ordained, to the Aaronic Priesthood or had any Authority to adm-  inister one of the ordinances of the house of the Lord. He was afterwards  ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood then to the Melchezedek priesthood  & Apostleship which is the highest office in the Church & kingdom   of God on Earth. When a man is ordained to the Apostleship &   keys thereoff if he dies in faith He will hold those keys to all Eternity   all the Prophets APatriarchs & Apostles who ever did or ever will   hold the keys of the Apostleship if faithful unto death will hold   them forever. President Young was an Elder when he was orda[ine]d   to be one of the Twelve Apostles some asked the Question how He  could officiate as an High Priest not having previously been orda[ine]d   a High Priest Joseph said the Apostleship covered all the offices   of the High Priesthood, the same as a private member orda[ine]d a   High Priest could officiate as a Deakon Teacher Priest or Elder   President Young said "I ordained most of the two or three first  Quorums of the Seventies and Joseph gave me vary particular  instructions to ordain them all High Priests which I did when   a man is ordained an High Priest Seventy or one of the Twelve He  can officiate in all the lesser offices of the Church whether He has been   ordained to that office or not. When I met with the Saints in   Nauvoo at the first meeting after Josephs death in defending   the true organization aga[in]st Sidney Rigdon I had it in my mind  all the time that there would have to be a Presidency of three   Appointed but I knew the people could not bear it at the   time and on our return as the pioneers from the valley I  Broached the subject first to Brother Woodruff and afterwords   to the rest of the Quorum they received it & finally sustained it      I spent the afternoon in the office Journalizing     
 July 29, 1860 ~ Sunday      29th ^1860^  Sunday I spent the day at the Tabernacle N H Felt spoke in the morning   I followed him.

When President Buchannan & the U.S.   Government sent Col Johnson & the U.S. Army to Utah it was with   the Express purpose to destroy the Church & kingdom from off the Earth   to put to death this people but the Lord sustained us & put them to shame   & confusion & to his name be the honor & glory. There are other Masons  sent to this territory for the same purpose to Esstablish a lodge here   & try to get an influence with some here to lay a plan to try to murder  me & the leaders of the Church but they will not accomplish it, now Brother  L. N. Scovill thinks so much of masonery that he might Join in with  them, G. A. Smith, said He does not wish to mix hair & wool but   he would like to Go to England & obtain five charters for lodges  which would give us a grand lodge which would make us independent  of all other Grand lodges in the world, this is what Brother Scovill  would like to do and this could be done but I do not think he would  be willing to mingle with our Enemies to the ingury of this people  President Young said I have no doubt but that thing could be done  & we could take our young men into the lodge but then I would aske  what Good could it do, what good could result from it I think   no good at all the truth is we have got to look to Lord God of Israel  to sustain us & not to any institution or kingdom or people upon the  Earth Except the kingdom of God, and I ask no odds of any man   or set of men beneath the heavens Except the Lord and his saints     
 Aug. 19, 1860  G. Q. Cannon said he was asstonished to come back & see how  cheerful & youthful the people looked & Esspecially the presidency after passing  through so much trouble He said he had herd Numbers say of the world  that there was some overruling providence that had sustained this people  through the war and they could not understand it.

Brother Edington   name was presented President Young said I do not know what good he  could do on a mission unless he had more wisdom in preaching than he has  in business matters he would not do much good he is a nice man & would   do well in fitting up a room for a party or a show but he would not   be worth a groat on a mission. If Ever G Clements has a mission  I want him to Feel like Brother Mills a year ago he would have thought  it a great calamity to have been sent on a mission now he wants to  go. Brother Kimball asked how it would do to send Dr Anderson  on a mission President Young asked what for, he is a vary nice plesant  man but he is thorough Infidel in his faith he had a talk with me   upon the subject and honestly acknowledged that he had no faith in  spiritual things "I want nothing said out of the council about this.

He refered to his teaching yesterday He said there was a tender  tender Jerm in every man which if rightly cultivated would to be   a God & a son of God but it was vary tender.

He spoke of the custom of the Druses   their religion caused them to bath often and they are temperate   while many of the Christians of that country are intemperate   and filthy which causes them to be weaker than the Druses which   gives the Druses the advantage over the Christians in war &c  while speaking of the U.S. armey here President Young said   if Col Johnson had staid in this Territory a few years he would   have known more than he does now, he planted his army in the  center of the settlements so the people would protect his army from  the Indians, if he would had made his settlements in Cash   Valley he would have had an outlet.

 4 ^1860^  For this same Doctrin is taught in some of the old Jewish records  which have never been in print and I know Joseph Smith nor Brigham   Young have never had access to and the Lord has revealed this doctrin  unto them or they could not have taught it. President Young said   if all that God had revealed was in fine print it would more than   fill this room but vary little is written or printed which the Lord  has revealed when God restores the Priesthood and Apostleship  he gives the keys to unlock the fountain of knowledge power & glory  when An Apostle is called & ordained all of the keys of the kingdom   of God upon Earth are sealed upon him and God reveals heis mind   & will through that source to the children of men for the govern-  ment & salvation of the children of men, and he reveals much in   evry age when the priesthood is upon Earth which is not written   or printed      [FIGURE] At about 3 oclock My Daughter Phebe wife of Lorenzo Snow   was taken in Labor at 3 oclok was taken in LDelivered of a daughter  at 15 minutes to 11 oclok she is doing vary well herself but her  daughter was supposed to be dead when born the midwife put the  child in warm water then in cold breathed into its lungs in  it remained without breathing for 30 minutes it then began   to breathed and breathed quit freely but was vary feeble through the night      September 5, 1860 ~ Wednesday      5 Phebe is quite comfortable this morning the child is vary  feeble and it is quite difficult to keep life in it at about 12 oclok  the child appeared dead Sister Zina Young was present &   took charge of the child she breathed into his lungs & done all  she could and the child soon revived & sonon nursed I brought  up Susan from the farm to nursed the child I Blessed the  child and Named it Mary Amanda Snow.

September 9, 1860 ~ Sunday      9 I met with my Quorum in the morning I opened by Prayer Bishop  Hunter was mouth. I attended meeting at the Tabernacle G Q Cannon  preached was followed by Capt Hooper & President Young they all  spoke in the power of God. In the Afternoon President Young   delivered a powerful discourse to saint and sinner [FIGURE] He command-  ed the Elders who were going on missions in the name of the Lord  not to come home as merchants, or in carriages, nor to Bring  home any silk dresses or any thing Els to theire wives or children  nor to ownly have 2 shirts & pants to be descent and all they  bring home as wealth let it ^be^ men, women, & children, let it  be spent in Emigrating the poor many have gone to get wealth  for their families but I dont want this done any more Now go  to & gather the poor.    J. D. Ross spoke a short time the meeting  was dismissed and all the missionaries were called to meet at the  Historians office at half past 4 oclok. At 4 oclok President Young    with the Missionaries met at the Historians office. He asked the   missionaries if there was any one who could not go I do not  wish to oppress any one there are a plenty of Elderss who are  able & willing to go no one excused himself The names were  then taken or called over to know who could fit themselves out  and all were provided for. You Elders what do you think of   the commandment I give you let your carriages be filled with  old men and women and you pull a wheel barrow, and if their  is feble men & women put them in Hand Carts with springs  and draw them in. Some of the Brethren sould not fit up &  a contribution was taken up to Fit them up B Young $100, H C K $50,  W Woodruff $25, John Taylor $60, F. D. Richards $30, D Spences $12,   Fineas TYoung $160. Adjourned till 22nd Sept at the 70s Hall for a   Blessing meeting all the Twelve should be present. President Young made  some remarks upon his commandments to the Elders He said that every     
 9th ^1860^  man that had gone out on missions and turned merchants they  are not worth a groat, when they come home they are empty   in spirit and become beggarly poor. Brother P. P. Pratt began this  in England and He was beggarly poor, for years & Erastus Snow  and F. D. Richards came home merchants and they are poor  and Orson Pratt came home in carriages & with silks and   satins and he is poor. He spoke in the power of God and sharply   rebuked the Twelve & Elders for their spirit of speculation   which they indulged in and when such Elders get home they   have not the spirit of God in them. He was followed by   George F Hendry. Elders Erastus Snow O. Pratt, & H. C. Kimball   all bore testimony to what President Young had said was   true. H. C. Kimball refered to P. P. Pratt being in merchandize  and would not trust him $5 and Yearsley said that He   would not trust H. C. Kimball nor God Almighty. We shall  live while millions of such men are dead He bore testimony   in the power of God to what President Young had said.  He said that the Elders had been like blood suckers from   Here to England, and it is time for it to be stoped, and  let the women alone & not be corting them but let them  alone. many bring home women & wandt the president to   soon seal a woman to him this will soon kill him   President Young then spoke to Orson Pratt & said that   the Book debt was the worst trouble the Saints handsd to   contend with for 6 years. Orson Pratt has done more   to make that debt than any other man so many Books   are forced upon the people and they are forced to take them   or they will not be fellowshiped notw stop publisheding   & geting your portraits taken & fill the kingdom with   them & make the people pay for them, this keeps the   people poor and keeps them from Emigrating. Brother  Orson Pratt hade made some remarks saying that he had used   his own means and not any of the means of the Church He had got  it all by his publications. President Young said it all coome out of   the poor saints Just as much as tho he had begged it. J V. Long   reported President Youngs speech which pierced the bones & marrow     
 9 ^1860^  and thoughts and intents of the Hearts of the Twelve Apostle and others of  who were present He spoke the truth in the name of the Lord with great   power & sharpness and power He reproved the sins of the Twelve & others   in a manner which made them feel by the power of God the necessity   of walking uprightly before the Lord, & to be free from all sin. At the adjournment  of the meeting we repaired to the Prayer room. Erastus snow Prayed & John  Taylor was mouth. (See privat Journal.)      September 10, 1860 ~ Monday      10th I spent the day in the office the forenoon Journalizing and the afternoon  looking over the mail matter for news but found but little.      September 11, 1860 ~ Tuesday      11 I spent the day Journalizing and compiling History I came in at 3 oclk  P.M. Found President Young in the office & T. Bullock reading to him the political   papers at the close of the reading I compiled History with Jaques      September 12, 1860 ~ Wednesday      12 I spent the fore part of the day compileing History I spent the afternoon   watering my garden.      September 13, 1860 ~ Thursday      13 I spent the day compiling History I attended the Bishops meeting   [FIGURE] President Young was Present and delivered one of the most powerful   discourses I ever herd from his mouth unto the children of men there was  no reporter Present nor clerk to keep minutes. Brother Calder wrote   some minutes & I reported the following synopsis of the presidents remarks   Meeting opened by prayer by W. Woodruff Bishop Hunter called the roll   & not more than half the Bishops present a part of the councillors. Bishop  Hunter then called for teams to draw Adobies & sand. Also Enquired if   there was houses to rent, several was reported. A recommendatin  was read from one of the Brethren as school teacher.       President Young then arose and said there is a good deal I want to  say to the Bishops but I dont think I shall say much to you to night   I would liked to have seen all the Bishops here to night many are   absent. I shall speak of those things which we want now. The Bishops  are the men more than others to attend to the Business of the Church  in the Stakes of Zion. I have said a good deal at times against   the Bishops perhaps more than they thought was right. But I now will   tell you what I want. We have missionaries going abroad upon their   missions we are all acquainted with the situation & Locations of theis   country. The revelations says take neither purse nor scrip. that is go without   taking food or money, now this revelation wias given to the Twelve in  Jerruselem a city filled with the wealth of the Nations it is like     
 13, ^1860^  giving the same commandment to Elders in New York City but   it cannot be Expected that Elders will start from this city to walk  a thousand miles to settlements without food or to kill there game by   the way. But they have got to be supplyed with means to go to there   Field of Labor. I now want to take up a collection next sunday  & the sunday following for the missionaries who are not able to fit   themselves out and I want the Bishops to see to it and attend to   it. I shall take up a collection for this purpose. we are in a land of   plenty we have a superabundance of means, now shall we send   out those Elders to beg of the poor saints who are already bound down  with poverty to obtain all their supplies No we will not. I do not mean   that this people shall stay here in their wealth and sin any longer &  send out Elders to preach & beg of the poor who have not means to  come to Zion as they have done heretofore. I intend this people  Hereafter shall find means to send the Elders to their fields of   Labor and if necessary to bring them back again. Our Elders   have had to beg so much frotm the people that they have bound   the Saints with chains of oppression, this must be stoped The   Saints in Zion must take this burthen off from the poor abroad   The people Here think [they] are vary good Saints but they have  but one Eye open. The Elders of Israel here in Zion have   there minds upon thworldly matters and not upon the building   ofup of the Kingdom of God. they will go into the stand and preach   and get down and pray and promise the Lord what they   will do. they will get up and and a horse trade will make   them deny all they promised the Lord as the Elders advanc  in the Kingdom of God did I say advanc No they do not   advance you will hear Elders get up in the stand and Exhort  the people not to Quarrel with their Neighbors or abuse there  wives or children. Now if the Elders were living their religion  & walking in the path of Duty they would consider such   preaching an Insult and a disgrace to them, as they would  be living above such conduct. The Elders and people are asleep   and there Hearts are set upon getting rich and the work of  God is out of sight to them. Now I will say to you Bishops that   I dont care a groat whether you or the people do one thing or     
 13, ^1860^  not but I will warn you that if you do not go to and raise  up means to assist in sending these Elders abroad and build up the   Kingdom of God. The Lord will raise up other people to do the   work which you and this people are called to do. any man who   holds the priesthood of God that commits sin and does not   magnify that priesthood He will have to pay the penalty and He   cannot Escape it. Now if the Bishops want to do their duty let   them go to work & raise means enough to help the poor Saints that   are going away. Orson Pratt, Erastus Snow, are poor. Brother Bywater   & John L Smith & some others want some help to get away, and their   families will want help after they are gone and the Bishops must see   to them such men as Ormus Bates can take care of himself &   others can, but those who cannot must be provided for, you may   think that I am hard. But all I would ask would be for the Bishops  and this people to see the things of God & his Kingdom as I do. But  when I think of the situation of the Earth, and the price of the Earth   which is no less than the life & Blood of the Lamb of God, and when  I think what the cost will be of the neglect of this people, their   worldly mindedness and unbelif it causes me pain. what is the   cost it is this Jesus Christ the Son of God our Elder Brother is at the   door and wants to come in and take possession of the kingdom  and reign triumphant over his foes and you wont let him,  this people are shutting up every avenue so that Jesus Christ   cannot come to the Earth. Can you see what it costs, it makes   my heart ake (while in this part of his speach he walked the floor   and his voice was like the voice of God) "all I will ask of this people is  to see things as I do then they would act & not sleep. Now what  do the Bishops know about their wards or what is going on in   there wards Nothing. Let me ask a Bishop how many grog shops  have you in your wards I dont know. How many Hore Houses I   dont know. How many gambling shops &c I dont know, and so it   goes all through the Church some poor woman will call upon a Bishop   or some man upon business in the morning the Bishop says O dont trouble   me I must go to the canyon for wood I dont want to be trouble though   I am your Bishop. Bishops do not magnify there calling in thes things Now   many Bishops are there here to night out of the 20 wards in this city not many     
 13 ^1860^  How much tithing do we receive of the people in this Territory   not one bushel of wheat in a hundred which is our due, not a tithing   of what we ought, and we have had to use much which we have   received as tithing to build roade up provo Canyon and other places   now we cannot get tithing in any thing which the people can   sell for money. Now if some man would appear on these streets   and offer cash for wheat, we would not get one bushel in a thousand   Now there has been $500,000 dollars worth of Freight annually   paid for goods brought to this Territory. in 10 years there has [been]   $5000000 dollars paid for goods now how much of that had   ought to come to the tithing office $500,000 dollars Now I will say to  you Bishops if you feel to lay this thing before the people I want   you to say to the people Bring on your diemes shillings half dollars   Dollars half, Eagles, Eagles Twenty Dollar peaces Fifty dollar   peases and send these Elders to their field of Labor. I will   now tell you how much the Elders in England have spent of the   tithing money. They have spent $54,0470 $27,035, each year   now I want this stoped. From the day that P. P. Pratt commenced   Begging in England up to the present time there is not one of that  class of Elders but what have become beggars and Hell is full of  such Elders and I dont care how soon the rest go there. I   went there and Esstablished the work and all the means I got I spent   in Emigrating the poor. I have said that I would sell evry scents  worth of property I possessed in the world for two thirds of its   value and give every dime of it for Emigrating the poor saints now   let any man or company of men come and Byuy my property &   I well give it to Emigrat the poor, and I will begin without one cent   and in 10 years I will be worth more than I am now. I will stop  this begging in England if I can and I think I can do it. you   Englishmen cannot you see the poor saints starving in England   and yet our Elders will beg the last cent they have got. This  subject has pained me for years But I have never had the power  untill now to handle it I now have the power and I will use it   thank the Lord. Other remarks were made by the president. I arose   and bore testimony to what President Young had said. The following   are some of the remarks I maidde     
 April 25  vary Edifying manner among other remarks He said "I want you to   go upon your mission in the spirit of God you will do more good by  bearing testimony of the work of God through the Holy Ghoost than all  the argument you can use you may take two men one may be vary  learned in all the arts & siences of the day and be able to preach a Bible  & a half in one serman and the other man may be ignorant of these   things but be filled with the Holy Ghost let one preach by his lear[n]ing  & argument the other by the Holy Ghost & the man that preaches by the   Holy Goh^o^st will make ten saints whare the other will one. I do not wish  by these remarks to lay one straw in the way of any of the Elders obtain-  ing a knowledge of the Arts & sciences and being armed with truthful   arguments upon evry subject, the Elders should sbeek diligently to obtain   all knowledge in their power but they should obtain the Holy Ghost to   assist them in their ministry. Unless a man can fell [feel] that he administers  the ussues [issues] of life & death unto the people he does not magnify his calling  as an Elder in Israel if a man [is] called of God to preached the Gospel   and he preaches it in the demonstration of the Holy Ghost according to  his calling it will prove a savior of life unto life or of Death unto death  to those who hear.      Some of you are going to visit your relations  now when you get whare your relatives are dont set down at your   Ease & give up preaching but remember that you are on a mission and   you should improve your time      You will have all manner of Evil   spoken against you and all I ask of you and all that God or angels will  ask of you is that not one word spoken against you will be true but   that it shall all be fals and I want you for your own sake, my sake &   for the sake of Christ & the Kingdom of God that the wicked shall  have no cause to speak one word of Evil against you And if you  will go & not let down one thread of your calling but do your duty  in all things I would feel perfectly safe in warranting all of you   a safe return home some have died while on there missions this   is lamentable For it is unnecessary For if an Elder goes &   does his duty in all things there is no neccesity of his Falling by   the way. another subject I wish to speak upon & that is about your   beging upon your missions. I do not wish you to beg but trust in gGod   & not have it to say when you come home that you have robed any   one or taking any thing unjustly from any one go & preach the gospel   Faithfully & trust in God and He will give you all he has for you     
 25th April 1860  There is another vary important subject which I wish to speak of & that  is the Temptation you will have From women this has caused the   down fall of more Elders in this Church than any other thing there is   some Elders who go on there missions all there lives and keep them-  selves clean & pure all there lives others comes home and are shady   there countenance Falls they cannot look you strait in the Eye they   fallen in the snare. Joseph said in speaking to the First Twelve that   they would have to watch against this snare For they would have  more trouble From this source than any other now let evry woman   alon while you are gone, dont lay your hand upon any woman, but   keep yourselves clean some have to bring a group of women with   them they have to get a new dove into there house while they are gone   let those things alone while abroad, but what is done upon that   subject let it be done here.       While abroad you will meet with   many who will want to debate with you but dont contend with any  man but make a Bargin with such men & tell them if they have one   truth which you do not possess tell them you will exchange ten   Errors for it if you will show me I have them.      I shall meet with you tomorrow you will have a letter of Instruction   redad & I want you to observe it you will have prayers in camp there   must be no swareing nor contention you may think this or that   one does wrong but impute it to the Error of the Head & not the Heart   I have Appointed Joseph W Young to preside over the camp going   down I dont want you to Hurry him those teams have got to come   back again, you will be carried with your provisions Free But I   want you to assist the Teamsters about getting along. Ther must not  be any abuse of cattle I have never permitted this in any company   I have had controll of I will never permit a man to abuse a dumb   brute yoaked or Harnessed up that cannot get away or speak for   himself but if a man wants to abuse any thing let him striken  a strong man that will knock him down in return but dont abuse  a dumb animal. At the close of the remarks Erastus Snow dismi-  ssed the meeting I walked home with Capt Gibson took supper with   him & conversed with him for some two hours concerning his mission   Former life. He remarked that the 25 April was a vary Notable   day to him He Escaped From his prison in the Island of Java He   arived home at South Caralina & and met with a warm     
 25 1860  demonstration of his townsmen on the 25 April. He had now been set   apart & Blessed under the hands of 2 of the Twelve Apostles (W Woodruff   being mouth) to go upon a mission to preach the gospel to the United States  upon the 25 April He felt much pleased with his blessing & wished me   to write it off & forward it to him      April 26, 1860 ~ Thursday      26th I spent the Forepart of my day writing in this Journal.

I called upon President Young in the morning & laid before   him Eleanor Pratt account of the Death of Parley P Pratt   and asked his advise about its being published in England He said   He did not wish it published but wished it retained in the office   we had the back mail came in by an ox team which brought  our papers which have been lying by the way side since last fall.      The President &  Twelve met at the Historians office to attend to the   Blessing of the remainder of the missionaries presidents Young and   Wells were present all of the Quorum of the Twelve except E.

 April 30 1860  He said Brethren I want you to be so full of the Holy Ghost & the power  of God when you get to England that I shall hear that you are so full  of teaching & wise council that it will run out of Both cornors of  your mouth. He said you will find some men there that have  some wisdom & some wisdom they have not got other remarks were made      May 1, 1860 ~ Tuesday      May 1st I spent the day in the office President Young called into the   office and spoke of Capt Gibson and of French who came in  yesterday & said Capt Gibson owed him $20 he came on with   him to this place President Young said He did not believe that Capt  Gibson owed him any thing he believed Capt Gibson was an   honest man & that he was honest in spirit.

I wish to say a word about the thieveing that  is going on in this Territory I say stop this stealing that is going on here   and if you cannot stop it in any other way stop it by stoping their   breath I would say the best way to stop both white & red men From   stealing is to take them with a rwrite of Habeas Corpus by led from  the muzzle of a gun that will settle matter & stop all Expens when   an Indian steals your property you want to kill him while he  has been taught to steal all his life but you will let the white man  go who has always been taught not to steal & he knows better. This  stealing must be stoped I would rather men would not be killed I   would chuse to have them quit stealing or leave the country but I want  stealing stoped, & it must be stoped we have rode Day [and] night to save

July 25, 1860 ~ Wednesday      25 The company commenced leaving the ground Early in the morning   & continued past noon one of Presidents Youngs waggons was turned  over into the Big Cotton Wood it turned twice over with two wom[en]  & several children one woman was hurt in the sholder one  child came near drowneding we arived here about 3 oclok 30 mils      July 26, 1860 ~ Thursday      26 I went down into the field I moved Susan Cornelia down to   the farm house, it rained hard for two hours which was vary  seasonable for the crops.      July 27, 1860 ~ Friday      27 I called upon President Young in the forenoon all  the Presidency were in the office. President Young read me a letter from Bishop   Maughn stating that there had been a fracas with the Indian   the Brethren had taken a one eyed Indian prisioner for stealing   and several Indians came down to liberate him the Indian started   to run & the guard shot him dead the other Indians shot at the guard  & killed a Brother Reed & mortally wounded Samuel Cousins   through the lungs, the Indians then took to the mountains & found   two Merrils getting wood they shot Ira Elias Merrill dead & his   Brother badly wounded they took some Indians prisioners the  rest gathered their forces & came down to liberate them & they   met 100 rifles they then held a council the Indians then  agreed to go & get those who had shot the white men & bring them  in & put them to death & make pease I spent the day in the office      July 28, 1860 ~ Saturday      28 A plesant morning I spent the day in the offices the forenoon with   President Young, Wells, Carrington, & R. L. Campbell. A Carrington   read the conference minutes and a sermon of President Young delivered   at the conference in Nauvoo Oct 1844. The minutes of this sermon   was compiled or written & furnished by Wm Clayton which done   great injustice to the subject. President Young gave a vary interesting   and instructive discourse upon the organization of the Church the power  of the priesthood the authority & duties of the various Quorums from   the deacon to the presidency But Brother Clayton in reporting it gave  a small portion of the sermon in detached sentences which gave an   Entire different meaning from what was intended Hence President     
 27th ^1860^  millions of years before our God was he also had to occupy an Earth  like ourselves and we shall find it out at some period and this   is all the mystery there is about it & if we are faithful we in   our turn shall be Exalted and become Gods, and there will be no  miystery about it when we understand it      O Hyde said I am satisfied that I have used a good deal of Philosiphy  whis is not true but that is all done away with, and I did not think  I should meet with the Prejudices of Potawatamie here to night  President Young said if you bring Potawatamie with you you must  expect to meet it. O Hyde said that he did not preach in Grants-  ville as Brother Joseph Young reported he did Brother Joseph was   not Present and he has been misinformed concerning it E. T. Benson   Explained the way O Hyde did preach He compaired the reseurrection  to taking a Journey around the world we travel all day stop at a   station at night lie down and sleep at night arise in the morning  & continue our Journey through another day & so on. So at the  End of this life we sleep in the grave till the morning of the resurre-  ction we then arise and continue our Journey. Brother Benson   also said I do not preach things which I do not know I keep  in shallow water I wish to teach the people those things which they  can understand, and those things we cannot understand I do   not trouble myself about, I know it is my duty to sustain the president  of this Church if I do not respect the President of this Church and belie  his word and I set my self up against him I am under condem  nation I would as lives cut off my right Hand, if he speaks to  us we must believe him and obey him. I mean to do it.      Erastus Snow said President Young has put words in my mouth  so that I can convey what I want. we are apt to say many things  which we do not mean & we injure ourselves. I cannot see things  in the same light that Orson Pratt does but when President Young has  taught doctrin it has always tasted good to me. I do not wish to  know any more than God wishes me to.      Orson Pratt said I will speak upon this subject I have not  spoaken but once in the Tabernacle since conference I then  spoke upon the revelations in the Doctrins & Covenants concerning the Father  & son & their atributes I spoke upon those attributes of the Father & son  I spoke of the Attributes of the Saints I gave my views upon the attributes     
 27 ^1860^  of God I sincerly believed what I preached, how long I have believed  this doctrin I do not know but it has been for years I have published  it in the seer, I spoke of a plurality of Gods, in order to worship  this God I said that I adored the atributes wharever I found them  I was honest in this matter * I would not worship a god or Tabernacle  that did not possess Atrtributs if I did I should worship Idols  I have thaught this doctrin. Now the reson I worship the Father  is because in him is combined the attributs if he had not those   attributs I would not worship him any more than I would this  chair. I cannot see any difference between myself and President  Young. If you had told me what you worshiped him for you  would have told me somthing, but now I can see no difference  between us. I wish to Explain Now Jesus said I am in the Father  & the Father in me. Now I do not suppose that the Father is in  the son & the Son in the Father in the Tabernacle, but in the spirit  and Attributes, truth light power &c. we are told that the son repr-  esents the Father in Attributs &c I called upon the Brethren to come   to this meeting to settel this But I must have somthing more than   a declaration of President Young to convince me I must have Evidence  I am willing to take President Young as a guide in most things but   not in all. President Young does not profess to have revelations in  all things. I am not to loose my agency I have said many things   which President Young says is Fals. I do not know how it is  I count president Young Equal to Joseph Iand Joseph Equal  to President Young I find things in Josephs Revelations   that govern me I would as liefer believes Joseph as  Brigham. When Joseph teaches one thing & Brigham  seems to teach another contrary to Joseph (I say seems to)  I believe them as Joseph has spoken them and as the Apostle  speaks of them I do not know God ownly tby his Atributes, and  that God who has the most Atributes I worship, I worship but one  God, and God does not dwell in me ownly by his Atributes I  have spoken plainly I would rather not have spoken so plainly  but I have No excuses to make President Young said I ought  to make a confession But Orson Pratt is not a man to make a  confession of that I do not Believe. I am not going to crawl to  Brigham Young and act the Hypocrite and confess what I do 
 27th ^1860^  not Believe I will be a free man. President Young condems my doctrin  to be fals I do not believe them to be fals I believe President Young  to be sincere in sayin that my doctrin is fals. I did not Believe  the doctrin fals which I published in the Seer in England. it has  been said we should let those things sleep. But you do not let them sleep  If I had thought while in England that President Young worshiped  a God without attributes I would not have written what I did      ((The above remark was an unkind cut in Orson Pratt he should not have said it))  But I do not believe it yet I will not act the Hypocrite it may cost me   my fellowship But I will stick to it if I die to night I would say O  Lord God Almighty I believe what I say.      Elder John Taylor spoke at some length and tried to convince Orson Pratt  of his Error. President Young said Orson Pratt has started out upon  false premises to argue upon his foundation has been a fals one all the  time and I will prove it false you have been like a mad stoubern  Mule, and have taken a fals position in order to accuse me you have  accused me of worshiping a stalk or stone or a dead Body without  life or attributes you never herd such a doctrin taught by me or any  leader of the Church it is as false as Hell and you will not hear the  last of it soon. you know it is false Do we worship those attributes No  we worship God because he has all those Attributes and is the dispensur  of them and because he is our Father & our God. Orson Pratt puts down  a lie to argue upon he has had fals ground all the time to night  Thare never was a time or Eternity but what a God did exist, and  a God that had children upon the same principle that children  are now begotton, and I was begotton by the God I worship   who reigns in the heavens and I shall also in my turn reign as   a God & so will you      O Hyde said to O Pratt, My opinion is not worth as much to me   as my fellowship in this Church      President Young said Michael was a resurrected Being and he  lef[t] Eloheem and kcame to this Earth & cwith an im[mor]tal Body & continued  so till he partook of Earthly food and begat children who were mortal  (keep this to yourselves) then they died. A Carrington spoke upon  the subject a short time & made some useful remarks      President Young spoke upon the subject of O. Pratt laying dow fals  principle to work upon That principle if carried out would place     
 27th ^1860^  us in a position that when a man got a fulness of the Attributs   of God they would have to worship themselves. But if we worship   God we worship him because he possesses all the Attributes and   dispenses them to the children of men all these Attributes are the   servants of God they serve his purposes and are at his command   President H C Kimball Followed President Young and said   Brother Orson Pratt has withstood Joseph and he has withstood   Brother Brigham many times and he has done it to night   and it made my Blood chill, it is not for you to lead but to   be leadd by him. You have not the power to dictate but to be dictated   W. Woodruff arose and said Brother Orson Pratt  I wish to ask you one or two questions, you see that the spirit   and doctrin which you possess ins entirely in a oposition to the First Presidency  The Quorum of the Twelve, and all who are present this evening and   it chills the Blood in our veins to hear your words & feel your   spirit should not this be an Evidence to you that you are wrong   what would become of the Quorum of the Twelve if we all felt as you do   we should all go to Hell in a pile together. You say you are honest in  the course you are pursueing, I wish to ask you if you was honest   when you said that if you had known that President Young   worshiped a God without life or Attributes that you would not have   written what you did (O Pratt said I will recall that) It was an insult   to President You[n]g and the Holy Priesthood which he holds, evry man   in this room who has a particle of the spirit of God, knows that President   Young is a Prophet of God and that God sustains him and He has the   Holy Spirit and his doctrins are true, and that he is qualifyed to  lead the people and he has explained evry thing so plain this evening   that a child can understand it, and yet it is no evidence to you, nothing   can make an impression upon you, no argument can reach your   understanding. But Brother Orson I have seen the day when  you was in sorrow it was when you was cast out of your Quorum  and out of the Church and that to in consequence of persueing the   same course you are this evening, then you could both see feel &  understand, then argument could reach you when you saw your glory   and crown departing from you. I beg of you to reflect and not let  your will carry you to Far in these things, it would be better for us   not to be able to cast up a single sum in adition and be humble before     
 27th ^1860^  the Lord than to have ever so much knowledge & permit that knowledge  to lead us to destruction. There are but few men upon Earth upon   whom God has bestowed such gifts, qualifications and reasoning   powers as he has upon you, and he will hold you responsible for   the use you make of them, and you should not make a wreck of your  salvation for contending for things which you do not understand   and I do feel at this advanced state of the Church, and late day   and with the information which you possess that neither you   nor your Brethren ought to be troubled with Fals doctrin Neither   should you cause your Brethren to listen to such a scene of things  as we have herd to night or to insult the president of this Church  as you have done, although you are unbending in your will to night  the day is not far distant when you will be glad to bend  to the president of this Chiurch and make reconciliation.   Erastus Snow Followed and backed up the Testimony of those  who have spoaken      Orson Hyde Spoke upon the subject and said Brother Pratt had  not got the spirit of God. He was followed By C. C. Rich who   backed up the Testimony of the Twelve in saying that Orson   Pratt was wrong. E. T. Benson spoke upon the same subject  and said if Brother Pratt had the confidence in President   Young which he ought to have he would Feel diferent if he had  the confidence in his Brethren which he should have I know He   would feel different      President Young said I will tell you how I got along with  Joseph I found out that God called Joseph to be a Prophet   I did not do it, I then said I will leave the Prophet in the   hands of that God who called and ordained him to be a Prophet   He is not responsible to me and it is none of my business   what He does it is for me to follow & obey him. I wonce was ash  amed of one thing which I did while in Missouri in Zions Camp   I got a revelation that God excepted our offering I had the same  thing revealed to me twice & that we should not go into Jackson Co.   I named this to some of the Brethren a day or two before Joseph   got a Revelation upon the same subject I felt ashamed that   I named it first, I knew whare we were going and I now   know that when we go to Jackson County we shall go from the west     
 27th ^1860^  and I will now tell you all and you may right it down that  all my preaching by the Holy Ghost it is revelation. I told the   Brother Joseph that he had given us revelation enough to last  us 20 years when that time is out I can give as good revelation   as their is in the Doctrins & Covenants. "Elder Taylor said  in one of his sermons that if we walk in the light of the Lord  we should have revelations all the time." it is the light that is   within you no man can live his religion without living in   Revelation but I would never tell a revelation to the Church untill  Joseph told it first. Joseph once told me to go to his own house   to attend a meeting with him he said that He would not go without  me. I went and Hiram Preached upon the Bible Book of Morm[on]   & Covenants and said we must take them as our guide alone   he preached vary lengthy untill he nearly wearied the people out   when he closed Joseph told me to get up. I did so I took the Books   and piled them all up on top of Each other. I then said that I   would not give the ashes of a rye straw for all those books for my   salvation without the living oracles I should follow and obey   the living oracles for my salvation instead of any thing Els when   I got through Hyrum got up and made a confession for not   including the living Oracles.      It may be thought strange by the Brethren that I will still fello-  wship Elder Pratt after what He has said, but I shall do it. I   amd determined to whip Brother Pratt into it and make him   work in the harvest. Orson Pratt said if I gratifyed my   feelings I had rather go into the canyon than to Preach I   have got to go to Tooele to get wood for my family. President Young   said I will give you a mission in Tooleele to preach & send word   to the Bishop to get some men & draw up his wood Brother Pratt   has no busines in the canyon the Lord does not want him there   F D Richard Dismissed the meeting      January 28, 1860 ~ Saturday      28th I spent the day in the office I met with the Twelve in the prayer circle   29Orson Pratt met with us he did not dress but said he wanted to be in   the Society of the Twelve. He seemed much more soft in his spirit than he had been      January 29, 1860 ~ Sunday      29th Sunday I met at the Tabernacle Orson Pratt was in the stand and   [FIGURE] Quite unexpected to his Brethren he arose before his Brethren   and made a vary humble full confession Before the whole assembly for     
 29 ^1860^  his oposition to President Young and his Brethren and He said he wished  all the Church was present to hear it He quoted Joseph Smiths  revelation to prove that President Brigham Young was ^right^ and that all   was under obligation sto follow the Leader of the Church I never  herd Orson Pratt speak better or more to the satisfaction of the   People, than on this occasion. he would not partake of the  sacrament untill he had made a confession then he partook of it  I attended the evening meeting at the 14 ward I Preached & was  followed by Orson Pratt.

The trial was conducted at Jeter Clintons office   the police Station at the close of the testimony Justice Clinton   called upon me to speak I addressed them some 15 minutes in giving them   a morral lesson to the young Men who were presient and had committed   wrongs upon there Neighbors and at the close The Justice Approved   of the course of Samuel Smith in not going out to fight with  the rowdies when they threatened him.

I called upon President  Young upon the subject He said he had no objections to its being in   the tabernacle if I would see it lighted I called upon L. L. Sprague  & Capt Gibson upon the subject I then attended Professors O Pratts  lecture in the 14th ward upon Natural Philosophy at the close I made  some remarks upon the subject of learning Recommended the   Family reading Books to be upon science instead of novels.

D. Watt I  also reported it. at the close of the meeting I in company with  Presidents Young & Kimball & J Taylor & Lorenzo Snow called  upon President D. H. Wells who was fast recovering from his sickness  while speaking of the Malays President Young said that He was of the  opinion that the Malays were of the seed of Abraham they went to   those Islands the same as they came to this continent they are  probably of Abrams promised seed. They have a cereimony to   marry for Eternity this principle shows that they obtained their  traditions from Ancient Israel for the gentiles did not practice  it & it has been handed down among them through many Generations  untill the present time. The Malays are a vary war like people & proud     
 March 4th ^1860^    and while in Battle rather than to be saved by one of there servants they   would perish they would not owe there lives to a slave. We see a great   varity of& grade of intelligence. I see right here in the midst of this   people some who do not know their right hand from there left   I see people freequently People who do not appear to have any underst-  anding they will also increas but they will be so far behind they   will never catch up, and they will never be any thing but serv-  ants. Such may be saved and get a good place. President Young said  I corrected O Pratt to day. I did not say to him that God would incres  increase to all Eternity. But I said the moment that we say that God   knows all things comprehends all things and has a fulness of all that He   ever will obtain that moment Eternity ceases you put bounds to Eternity   space & matter and you make an End and stoping place to it. The people   or many say thay cannot understand thes things, this is true No man   can understand the things of Eternity And Brother Pratt and all   men should let the matter of the gods alone I do not understand these   things Neither does any man in the flesh and we should let them alone   some men profess infidelity but when they go into Eternity they will  find all they see in this life upon the Earth is ownly a similitude of   what thay will find in the next world. In speaking of the subject   of faith He said we will find but little faith but a good deal of belief   every body has that for it is an inherant principle in all. I have  laid hands upon people when I knew they would be healed at other   times I have laid hands upon people when I did not feel that   way & still they were healed. I once laid hands upon a sister   Lake when she said she had No faith I told her I did not care   whether she had or not for I had and I knew she would be   healed. I laid hands upon her & she was immiediately healed. I   dont know how it is or how faith comes ownly as the gift of God   I know No other way to get it. John Taylor said Joseph told   him on[c]e to go & lay hands upon a person who was possessed of   a Devil & cast him out and leave the house & dont speak to   any person I did so & left the house without saying a word   & the devil left her.      The conversation turned upon Josephs children   Brother Taylor said it was a pity that Emma had such an influence over   them B Young said Bless your heart the Lord watches over them  & will take care of them.

I would like that doctrin for then I would   have a house as Big as Brigham Young, No you would not untill  you Earned it. In speaking of Building up the centre stake he   said I [k]now the Lord will not keep us out of Jackson County one day  longer than we are prepared and the ownly fears I have had in the  matter is that the Lord will get tiered of waiting for us to get read[y]  and and will say I will wait no longer and if there is not five  ready to go more than five ready to go to Zion let them go &   build it up I do not think there is any prepared to go yet I do  not think that I am prepared yet to lay the corner stone of the  New Jerrusalam.

Watt  President Young Spoke to the people 58 minutes He said that the whole   curse of the Earth had got to be taken off from the Earth by the  Latter day Saints. We have got to be sanctified & sanctify all     
 July 13, 1865      the Earth & we have got to begin by sanctifying our own  hearts first & then spread out. How many of the children   of this people are Entitled to the Holy Priesthood & the Blessings   of Abraham all who are born after their parents have received   their Endowments & are sealed & all others will have to be adopted   to their parents. All who want the Blessings of Abram  Isaac & Jacob go & get your Endowments before you get   married. then all your children will be heirs to the   priesthood. their is no son has a right to the Priesthood   & heirship unless their parents had their Endowments   before they were born such must be adopted to their  Parents or they have no right to the heirship. Let no youth   get married untill they get their Endowments & get sealed   at the Altar. If young men knew what was for their   good they would go hundreds of miles to get married  right before they would do as many have. Our boys who  are guided by a right hand will be mighty men ^of God^ in the   Earth. The Lord instituted Polygamy to raise up a royal  Priesthood a kingdom of Priest, it is an institution of heaven  all the blessings that are sealed upon us will do us no good unless  we live for them {Remember son Wilford} The Lord has in store for his children   Every good thing the heart can desire in righteousness. The   Celestial kingdom will be on this Earth to us when we are   celestial with the Earth. The Earth when it fell went Millions   of miles from the presence of God & when it returns back it will   go millions of miles from its present position to whare it came   from. Whare is the Mechanic that has knowlede Enough to lay   the first cornor stone of the New Gerrusalem {God might reveal this to someone}  Ancient Israel the seed of Abraham was not found worthy  to keep the Melchezedeck Priesthood, what then is to be done.  The Lord said I will in the Last days raise up a generation of   Men, a royal Priesthood who would come forth to redeem the death   of Israel as well as the Liveing. This is our work ye latter Day  Saints. Then rise up ye Latter Day Saints of God & do the work  of God required at your. The Lord Acknowledged Ancient Israel  because they were the best there was, but there was not light Enough     
 July 13 1865      to light one match. The breath of this people would sanctify the Camp  of Israel as it was Anciently. And now I will say to all the people get   your Endowments & be sealed, then your children Will be legal heirs  to the priesthood & Birth right if this is not the case with you your  children will have to be sealed to you. Capt Hooper then spoke 5 minutes  President Young then returned thanks to the people for their kindness to   him & his company. I do not feel worthy to receive the blessings that  I Enjoy.

Use up thes  wicked Indians who are killing the inhabitants & if these indians  who profess to be friendly will not help bring them to justice, do   not let them stay with you but treat them as Enemies, &   if white man will not help make him. There is not a Blessing  on Earth or in heaven that is good but what is ordained for a  good man. A wicked man cannot have them but a short time  while the good will inherit them forever President Young spoke  upon the word of wisdom how hard it was for us to overcome but  "I will not let an appetite or passion master me.

Now here is the Presidency & Twelve there  is no two of them that look alike or preach alike, their minds   run in different channels yet they preach by the same spirit     
 Sept 17 1865  There is not a Better or handsomer set of men to be found  upon the Earth than they are. I am the most homely man   among them, so they let me say about what I am a mind to  but if I get much out of the way, President Young is here to correct   me as it is his place to correct all the Errors of the Church.  It is a hard Matter for the Lord to Esstablish his Church  & kingdom upon an Earth whare the devil has power & dom-  inion & reigns over the hearts of the children of men & it   would be an impossibility for the Lord to build up his kingdom  upon this Earth if he could not get some element, even some  of the children of men to work with him, and this has been  the difficulty since the creation of the world, that the Devil has  ruled over the hearts of the children of men to that degree that   the Lord could not find men Enough upon the Earth who would  submit for the Lord to rule over them, & lead them sufficient to build  up his kingdom to remain upon the Earth. Even in the days of  Enoch the Lord had to take him & his company off from the   Earth because they could not live upon it. The Lord has now   set his hand one more for the Last time to Esstablish his kingdom  upon the Earth to remain, to overcome the Devil & his works &  subdue the Earth, & the Lord has decreed that this should be accomplished  and the Lord has taken all the pains in his power to Accomplish it  He has brought forth the best spirits that Ever dwelt in His  presence, to come forth upon the Earth to work with him in the  accomplishment of this work. Even Joseph Smith was retained   in the Heavens for seven thousands years to come forth in   this day to lay the foundation of this Church & kingdom to   be trown down no more forever, nor to be given in to the hands of   another people. The same is the case with the Presidency, Twelve  & many others in this Church & kingdom & the Lord has sent  his Angels to watch over them from the day they were   born untill now, to presevrve them from the power of the devil   who has sought there destruction from the beginning And  we have visited the Nations of the Earth, for the last thirty years  to gather together the seed of Ephraim, the best spirits that   dwell upon the Earth into these vallies of the Mountains to     
 1865  assist in esstablishing this great & last kingdom of our  God upon the Earth to remain forever, & the Lord Almighty  is inspiring his servants with the spirit of his work, &  the Holy Priesthood, & is arming them with power to accom-  plish his purposes upon the Earth. Joseph Smith was the promised  seed to come forth to lay the foundation of the kingdom, see what  he has Accomplished. He labored but 14 years, 2 Months, & 18 days  from the time He first organized the Church of Christ upon the   Earth, then He sealed his Testimony with his blood and all his   Father's family died as Marters & will be crowned in the presence of  God (Except William, if he had been a good man he would have    been in the spirit world with his family Fathers family long ago  but he has not been fit to live or die) Joseph the Prophet during   his short labor laid the foundation of this great kingdom that   Daniel saw. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] He organized the Church & Kingdom with a full   & complete organization, sent the gospel in its fullness & glory  to the nations of the Earth, gathered tens of thousands of Saints built   Temples & founded cities, gave Endowments to the Twelve Apostles   Elders & Saints & sealed all the Keys of the kingdom of God upon  The Twelve Apostles & Brigham Young as there President.  President Young is before you, look at him, he has the Appearance   of a Man about 40 years of Age, He is 64. He has travelled more   Miles, Attended More Meetings, Preached More sermons,  delivered unto the people more of the word of the Lord, revelation  prophesy, principle, sealed more blessings upon the heads of the   children of Men, United more in the Marriage Covenant,   Administered more of the ordinances of the House of God, Attended  to more branches of business, had more wives, Raised up more  children, created more recreation for the youth to keep them   out of the clutches of the devil, danced more cotilions, Built   more Temples, Tabernacles, Meeting Houses, School Houses, dwell-  ings & made more improvements & done more for the salv-  ation of Man, & the redemption of the Earth than any   man that Ever dwelt in flesh during the space of 30 years,  He has brought more to pass & Accomplished more in   30 years than the Early patriarchs did in 500 years     
 Sept 17, 1865  Why is all this, it is because the Lord is agoing to make a short   work on the Earth, in the last days, & cut his work short in righteous-  ness. He is inspiring his servants with the power of God & the  spirit of his work, & a desire to build up his kingdom & Mount  Zion as Men have Never before been inspired. This great   & mighty work is put into your hands to perform ye saints   of latter days. No greater work can be given into the hands  of Men in the flesh. Then rise up ye saints of God & do the  work required of you & the Lord will work with you, sustain   you & redeem you & give you power to Accomplish all  that has been promised through the Mouth of all the Holy Apostles  & Prophets since the world began which may God grant for Christ sake Amen  G A Smith Dismissed the Meeting       Afternoon Prayer By F.

Most people thought that we should go to vancovers Island  we were urged to go to Calafornia. had we have gone there  we should not have gone staid but a short time we could not have   staid there. the Emigration would have overwhelmed us, but we  intend to Fill these mountains, we have been visiting these southern  settlements I see no sorrow among the people, there is one article the  Saints want to take with them whareever they go in all places and   that is contentment. When we go to the Centre Stake of Zion we  shall not have 600 Acres of Land each to run over, No we shall  have a small spot. There will not be a chicken pig cow horse or  any animal in the City. If you put in one Acre to grapes as it  should be you could take $5000 for the use of it. Again tobacco  if you must use it raise it yourselfes you can raise $1000 lbs on  an Acre at $2 per lb it would fetch $2000. You have welth in  the soil here, you have advantages here which we have not in   the North. If we go East & get more land we shall have  more people to occupy it. We shall have to raise more out of the  Earth than we do now. The Lord is blessing you and the   Earth you inherit, you do not have so many foul spirits to  contend with as we do in the North, both from the Living & the  dead."

Smith buried a child to day it   snowed and rained through most of the day      The following is a synopsis of Presidents Youngs remarks on the   30, at the Funeral of sister Ivins      "On such occasions as this I can say that I have many reflection  we are subject to pain, sickness & death yet we cling to life. when a     
 1863      Person dies all we can do for them is to bury them decently we cannot    preach to the Dead. It is right that we should cling to life that we   may live to do our Duty, to build up the kingdom of God but we should   not cling to the world or to set our hearts upon the things of the world   we should live Every day so that we should be satisfied with our-  selves at night it will be an Evidence that the Lord is satisfied   with us we should seek to do our duty day by day. Brother Joseph   in his remarks said that He wished we had the faith we on[c]e had. I   see the power of God manifest around me Every day. Joseph laid   hands with me yesterday upon one of my wives who was vary   sick & it seemed as though she could not live an hour & she was   healed right up & thousands of the saints who are now alive   would now have been in there graves if it had not been for   the Exercise of faith in the midst of the saints. we have in our   bodies the seeds of Death & our secret Enemy takes every advantage   He can to destroy our lives from off the Earth. many of the children   are taken away As to Sister Ivins she Appeared to be ripe   she was in years. Whare has she gone she is in Paradise, in the   world of spirits whare is it, It is in this world & on this Earth   I do not think sister Ivins is far off she may be in this room   we have not to go out of this room to find the Lord, He is in all   places by his influence. I told Brother Orson Pratt when He said   there was Empty space if he would show me where it was I would   show him one place where the Lord was not. All men will   have to pass through the ordeal of Death. Jesus Christ went through   the same & all men will have to go through the same. Our bodies go   to the dust where they will lie untill they are raised up clothed   with Immortality we shall meet Sister Ivins in the Resurrection  she has been kindly treated by her children & all the family   and I feel to Bless them for it I have never met with Sister Ivins   but what she manifested a good kind contented spirit, we   all want to be prepared for that which is to come, we should Exercise   faith for the devils wicked men & Nations & all Hell are triying to   destroy the Latter Day Saints & the Kingdom of God. We have the seeds   of death within us & the devils take the advantage of us & try to destroy   us in our weakness. I would rather have the faith of the gospel than     
 1863      the gold of the world. I know the feelings of the people, they might have the   Loright of the Lord but they are seeking for gold & will not do as they should  I know the feelings of the people where they are Justified before the Lord & where   they are not, we have to bear with them chastize them, then comfort   them &c, and do the Best we can with them I know the standing of this   people before the Lord all the time I do not say much to them. I do not tell   them all I know. May God Bless you amen      November 1, 1863 ~ Sunday      Nov 1st 1863 Sunday      I attended my Prayer Circle in I was mouth & Edward Hunter   Prayed.

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'S  JOURNAL  FOR   1864     
 January 1, 1864 ~ Friday      Jan 1st 1864 This is the commencement of a new Year   I have lived to see 56 New Years And I have kept a daily   Journal for the last thirty years of my life and in some   measure the life of others. I have written many sermons   and teachings of the Prophets Joseph Smith & Brigham Young &   of other Apostles and Elders. I have watched the signes of the   times for many years, and the fulfilment of Prophesy.   And I am satisfied that there are great & mighty Events at our   doors among which are great wars, Famines, Pestilence,   Earthquakes, stormes, & tempests, the overthrow of Republics,  Nations, Kingdoms, & thrones, the opening of the seals   and the Pouring out of the Plagues upon Great Baybylon   in fulfillment of Daniel, The Revelator John, & Joseph Smith   and all Prophets who have spoken of the last days. [##Daniel 11##] [##Revelation ##] The  last three years have been vary important in the History   of the United States. The union has been dissolved and   A Bloody war has ben raging for three years, and the   spirit of God is being withdrawn from the Nation and   the wicked are slaying the wicked and the land is being   deluged in Blood and great destructin awaits the Nation   and there are great Events await all Nations and the   way is preparing for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ   and his coming will overtake the world as a thief in the   night. [##1 Thessalonians 5:2##] 1864 will be an Eventful year and so will all   the following years untill the Coming of the savior. The   Lord is watching over the interest of Zion and sustaining   his Kingdom upon the Earth and Preparing the way for the   return of his Saints to Jackson County Mo to build up the  waste places of Zion Jackson County have been Entirely   cleared of its inhabitants during the year 1863. Which is   one of the greatest miracles manifest in our day, and those   who have driven the saints out of Missouri & spoiled them   are in there turn now driven out and spoiled and there is   much distress throughout all the land where the saints   have been persecuted. And the judgments of God will   continue upon the whole Nation untill the Blood of the prophets is avenged

 January 11, 1864 ~ Monday      Jan 11th 1864      [FIGURE] I called upon Brother Burton & then I called at the Court   House and had another interview with Jason Luce who is sentenced  to die tomorrow. He still feels sure that He will not die. he thinks   that he has the testimony of the spirit of the Lord, that He will   live & not die. He said that he was innocent of many things  that the people thought he was guilty off He said that he had   never killed any person or had any hand in the death of any   person except Rhodes & Bunting & said that he could not   fell that he was guilty of murder in the death of Either of them  He had killed them in self defence He said Wm Hickman   had advised him to do many things that made his flesh   crallwl but he had not followed Hickmans advise in these things   He told the Jailors (which I did not Hear) that Hickman   once asked him to go & knock an old man in the Head   for no other purpose ownly to obtain an old mare that was  not worth more than $30. And He feels that Wm Hickman   has betrayed him and done him much injury & he looks  upon Hickman as a vary bad man. He said he would like  to see me tomorrow. He thought to day was the time appointed  for his Execution untill I told him it was tomorrow. I went   to the council & spent the afternoon & attended to the business   of the day And in the Evening I again called upon Jason Luce  in company with John Sharp, T. B. Stenhouse R. Burton &   many others. G. D. Watt being present acted as reportinger in   taking an account of what Jason Luce would reveal unto us in   his last moments. I called upon Governor Reed & asked   him if he would commute Jason Luce sentence to the Penet-  entiary foor m life as Hickman had held out this promise  to Luce. Soon Hickman & Wilford Luce came in for their   answer & Mr Reed told them He could do nothing in the  premises that He considered that He would be commiting  crime to change the sentence of Luce unless he had better   ground than any thing He had seen. So when I arived   at the prision in the Evening I told Jason Luce there was   no chance for him to live & I wished him to prepare to die. He  then spent more than an hour giving us an accunt of what     
 Jan 11, 1864      He had done & what he knew. He said in the case of Drown &  Arnold that Hickman was responsible for their death. He killed  them with the help of one or two others. He said Wm A Hickman  robed Carpenter's store took the goods in his waggon & carried  them to Huntingtons & from Huntingtons to his house over Jordon   & then told Furguson if he would kill Carpenter He would   clear him that He should not lyie in Jail one day Furguson killed   Carpenter & was Hung for it & Hickman made him believe  that he would be liberated up to the last minute. Luce said that   Hickman Murdered [blank] for no other purpose   ownly to obtain his gold watch & money & thinks he has the watch   yet. He said that Hickman was at the head of a Band of thieves   they have stolen as high as 100 Head of cattle at a time from  Camp Floyd & gone ount onto the prairie & divided them & taken   them to different parts of the Territory. Luce also said that  Hickman had many men around him that Had to be fed & that   men under him would go onto the range & drive up a Beef  & kill & Eat it & sell the Hides or make them into Larretts   or throw them away as the case might be without any regard   to whom might be the owners. Luce said that Hickman had  been his ruin and the ruin of others and in all thes things  He had carried his point by declairing that President Brigham  Young hagd given him council to do all these things (which   is a cursed lie) Luce made many other remarks which was   reported by G. D. Watt      January 12, 1864 ~ Tuesday      12 [FIGURE] At Eleven oclok I called at the prision & was with   the prisioner untill a few moments before his Execution  His Mother Brothers wife & 5 children visited him last night   also this morning.

He had a vary hard time to  part with his wife children & Friends. He felt to confess all   of his and ask the forgiveness of God & all men for all   his crimes.

 1862   1862 Has past and left its trace upon the Historians   Record. It has been a vary important year it has fulfilled   the Historians predictions & the predictions of the prophets (see  the last page of this record written ithe last day of Dec 1861)   There has been more blood shed, & lives lost in the United   States in the battles between the North & South in 1862 than  there was in the Revolutionary war & the war of 1812 with   Great Brittian. The most Bloodydy battles were faught at  the following places Mill Springs, Pea Ridge, Fort Donellson,  Pittsburgh landing, Fair Oaks, 7 days battle before   Richmond, Cedar Mountain or Bulls run, Antietam,   Corinth, and Fredricksbugh. In these ten battles alone  the number would not fall much short of half a   Million of men who were killed & wounded and then   there has been scores of Miner battles which have slain   many thousands. Many also have been slain by pest-  ilence there has also been great destruction of property   by fire & otherwise. The spirit of Disunion seems to incr-  ease among the people. There has been a great want of Bread  in England and France during the past year caused in a great  measure by closing up the southern ports which has stoped   the importation of cotton. France has opened a war with   Mexico and there is a great lack of confidence through-  out the Earth betwen man & man and between all the Nations   of the Earth, there are many widows and orphans and   much morning & Lamentation through the Land in conseq-  uence of the much blood which has been shed during the past   year but the End is not yet, but ownly Just commenced peace   is taken from the Earth and the wicked are inspired to   slay the wicked. While these things are going on the Saints   are gathering home to Zion to build up the kingdom of God, then   the Lord may reign over his Saints while Satan rules over  his own Dominion. There has been Near 5000 Saints   gathered into these vallies during the past year. The Temple  foundation has been taken up in part & relaid & many impro-  vements have been made, & the Blessings of God have been upon Zion

 Jan 11th 1863  ^[FIGURE]^ President Young Preached in the Afternoon. He read the   Vision given to Joseph Smith & Sidney Rigdon then He preached   upon it He spoke of the various glories & the different characters   who would occupy them He said all children who died in childhood   would go to the celestial kingdom and thereir Mothers if they do   not keep the celestial layw will not go whare there children   are & will never see them again but the children will be given   to others. He said many interesting things. I met with the  Twelve at 5 oclok for prayer O Pratt Prayed E. T. Benson was  Mouth. I attended Meeting at the 14 ward school House O. Pratt  Preached A vary singlar discourse. He spoke of building the   [FIGURE] New Jerrusalem in Missouri said we must not build   log Houses as the city would be translated & they would   be Everlasting Habitations & would remain forever He spoke   of the starry Heavens He did not think the sun or any star   which mortal Eye could see were celestial Bodies but as soon   as a world became celestial it could not be seen by man no more  than a spirit could be seen or a Resurrected body by mortal   Man. in speaking of the creations of God He said they could not be   numbered and to illustrate it take a cubit inch of fine sand & with   a magnifying glass number the millions of particles of sand in the cubic  inch then multiply the cubic inches in our globe then multiply   the cubic inch of one Million of Millions of worlds and this  would not be the begining of the creations of God and yet his   curtains are stredched out still & from all the creations of God   He had taken the Zion of God into his own bosom. He referd   to different Asstronemers who had in ages past marked   upon there maps the starry heavens & many of those fixed   stars had since been removed, & could not be seen & he   believed that when this Earth was consumed by fire & reorga-  nized & became celestial that it could not be seen by the  inhabitants of any planet in our solar system, or by any   Except a celestial body. The Zion of God must be a vast   body if it contained a Zion from all the creations which   God had made. Many remarks were made by professor Pratt  and He carried our minds so far from Home it took me till midnight to get back     
 January 12, 1863 ~ Monday      12 Jan 1863  I spent the day at home.

A Joint committee was app-  inted to wait upon Govornor Brigham Young & informed him that  the Assembly was organized & ready for any communication he  might wish to make. Governor Young accompanied the committee  to the State House & themet the Joint assembly & delivered to them his  Message (see Printed Message) 2000 copies of the message was  ordered to be printed & it was also to be printed in the Deserett News  Govornor Young then addressed the assembly He said  I wish to say a few words. Many may not be able to tell why  we are in this capacity. I do not think that you see this thing  as it is. Our organization will be kept up. We may not do  much at present in this capacity yet what we have don or  shall do will have its Effect. Our constitution which we sent to  Washington has been closely scanned by the members of Congress  all of our moves here are feared by the nations of the Earth  Esspecially the United States. This body of men will give laws  to the Nations of the Earth. We meet here in our seconed annual  Legislature & I do not care whether you pass any laws this season  or not But I do not wish you to loose one inch of ground you     
 Jan 19 1863  have gained in your Organization but hold fast to it for  this is the kingdom of God and we are the friends of God  and you will find that much will grow out of this organiza-  tion But I will say without the inspirations & revelations of  God our acts are of no use. We are called the State Legislature  but when the time comes we shall be called the kingdom of God  Our Government is going to peaces and it will be like water  that is spilt upon the ground that cannot be gathered if we  do not take care of ourselves no one will take care of us  We are the best of any people on the Earth, and there is no  people as well off as this people on the Earth for light & the  knowledge of God. In 1857 we said to 7000 troops stop  and they stoped had there been but 500 like these troops here  we should have let them come in for they would not have  done any harm it is our business to take care of ourselves  if we see the Enemy coming it is our duty to prepare for  it. I can do better to never trade again in my life with a  wicked man. I will name one thing. I built a theatre here  myself. some wanted the Armey to come here I do not, and  since the Armey got up a Theatre for themselves we have been  crouded to the full. I will be richer in the End if the wicked  do not come nigh. I do not care whether you sit one  day or not. but I do not want you to loose any part of this  Government which you have organized, for the time will come  when these men will give laws to the Nations of the Earth  Joseph Smith organized this Government before in Nauvoo  and He said if we done our duty we should prevail  over all our Enemies. we should get all things ready &  when the time comes we should let the water onto the wheel  and start the machine in Motion      President Kimball made a short address said He remembered  well what Joseph Smith said upon the organization of this  kingdom. He said if we done what was right we should  be sustained by the power of God and the Holy Ghost. we have  to go step by step. The words of the prophet will be fulfilled upon  the Earth and many of us will live to see the kingdom of God     
 Jan 19 1863  Esstablished upon the Earth He made many interesting remarks  & bore testimony to what had been said. After Electing a public  Printer & ordering 2000 copies of the message Printed the Joint assem-  bly dissolved      January 20, 1863 ~ Tuesday      20 We Met in the State Legislature & done some business then  adjourned Sine Die there were parties in the Social Hall & 14 ward  school House      January 21, 1863 ~ Wednesday      21 I spent most of the day Journalizing I wrote Gov Youngs Address      January 22, 1863 ~ Thursday      22nd I salted down a Beef spent a part of the day in the office  attended a party at Brother John Taylors we went to the 14  ward school House and danced a short time and returned Home      January 23, 1863 ~ Friday      23 I spent the fore part of the day in the office      January 24, 1863 ~ Saturday      24 I spent most of the day in the Endowment House we gave Endowments  to 27 B.

A. Smith F. D. Richards & W. Woodruff  of the Twelve, & a large congregation of the Saints President Young  Preached. The following is a synopsis of his remarks      I can say to Brother Smoot & family that they have not a  thousandth part the reason to regret or grieve in this bereave-  ment that other parties have who have froward sons. I would  rather follow all my children to the grave than to have them  froward in their wasys & witnessing them turning from the     
 June 22nd, 1863  paths which are right. When our children are called to go  hence. When our children are taken from us who have  not Jeperdized their chances of Salvation, we have reason  to rejoice instead of mourning. I knew this young lad, he was  a fine boy and as far as he had grown up he manifested  the finest traits of character. he is now locked up whare  he is safe and sure of salvation Is not this a comfort?  It is to me. What would have been the lads future course? We  do not know. I do not know what will be the future course of  my children. Do you know? I have witnessed such scenes.  Ownly once in my life has my head acked. This was when  Joseph was killed, was martered. in parting with Fathers  Mothers, wives & children is no comparison to it. When I feel  as though the top of my head was coming off then I think  sumthing is the matter I felt this was for Many days  I can call to mind, those who have Endured more than  I in some things. Here sit b sits before me to day a good Father  & mother who lost a son under more painful circumstances  than this. He was murdered & his remains scattered over  the plains. We have before us a beautiful boy cut down in  the flower of youth yet we have No cause for morning, this  I do know that when our youths have lived according to our  council we have No cause to mourn. It is no trial of my  faith to see my children laid in the grave But to see them  Join with the wicked, forget their duty, & become froward  this is a trial which in part I have Experienced all I ask  is for grace to bear up under such trials that I may settle down  in calm serenity and feel that the Lord giveth & the Lord taketh  away & blessed be the name of the Lord. I have heard that Brother   Smoot regretted that his son had not received his Endowment  we are the ownly people that that can give our children their  blessings. We can do it. Others cannot this should be a source  of consolation to us. What is there for us to grieve about. Crying  because God has taken our child to Heaven. Well we might cry if  the devil had taken our child to Hell. If this family sit up &  shout Hallalujah it will be more pleasing to the Lord than to sit up to cry     
 June 22, 1863  Death is in the Land & we may Expect it I have freequently said when  I die give me a decent burial that is all I ask. The grave has seemed  to me the sweetest place I ever looked into in my life Brother Smoot is  perhaps a better man than most of us. his trials remind him that he  is still in a land of sorrow & trouble. If all who bear the name of saints  get into the celestial world it will be because they purify themselves and  are faithful & overcome & feel a little more the responsibility that belongs  to the kingdom of God than many now do.
