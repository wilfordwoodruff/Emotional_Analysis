During my stay in America I have allways been with Germans, hence I am not well acquainted with the English language. But I know that there are many Germans in the Mormon church, and also several families from my former neighborhood in Germany; there was once a Mormon missionary active in a neighboring town and met with quite good success. But I am sorry that I never made the gentlemans acquaintance, because I then took not the interest in the Mormon church, which I take at present. I have very good testimonials; in the old country I was for some time active as traveling preacher. Some time ago I found your address in a German Methodist paper, which gave a treatise on the moral situation in the Mormon church.

ENDENTRY then; but as that account may not  be at hand I will briefly report on the  inquiries made of me:  We have a home two and one half  miles from the centre of Ogden, in  what is called Lynne, consisting of  three acres of land, with a house of  convenient size for our family and  necessary outside conveniencies.  This home with the improvements  we have put upon it cost us, two years  ago, about 1500.00. What it could be  disposed of for, with the increase of  values in property generally, since then,  I could only make a guess at.  When we moved to Ogden about seven years ago we had only what we brought  with us in the thewagon that moved us  here, but we concluded to borrow money  and buy a home, rather than pay rent, and pay back the amount as fast as  we could. We are still owing over  $100.00 on that loan.  Five years ago next March, we  took stock of 5 shares in the Ogden  Building and Savings Association, paying  thereto 5.00 per month, which should  mature between now and next fall. giving us a credit of $500.00  Two years ago we were pursuaded  by the officers of the Standard Pubs Co.  to borrow $500.00 and take stock to  that amount in the company, and this  we have been paying interest on ^since then^ without  any dividends to offset the expense,  our circumstances being such that we  were not able to lessen the principal  of the debt.  My salary in 1888 was $65.00 per  month, in 1889 it was $70.00.  We have no income only my monthly  salary, which is as last year.
