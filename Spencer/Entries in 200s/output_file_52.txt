There is but three other houses on the whole plat one a small adobie one a log and a hole in the ground  We left Cedar City on the 16th of of Nov with bro Williams with us making a 9 nine in all in the company their loading was Flour and Oats We traveled to warm spring or Little Painter Creek about twenty miles from Cedar here we camped and al- lowed the animals to run loos over night the next morning three of them were missing. The brethren hunted for them three days without finding them and had come to the conclusion that they had returned to Cedar City and bro Jones had just sent to men back to hunt for them there when they came into camp of there own accord. Another man was soon dispacth to bring the other two ^men^ back they did not return until the next evening which made four days that we were detained at this place  We started on our Journey again on the 21st and passed through Painter Creek Valley. Here Bro R. C. Allen with some of the Indian missionaries have commenced to make a new settlement and intend to finish the Fort next season The Valley is a small one and ^the land and water^ is not sufficient to sustain but a few families The range is good and extensive. We had a heavy snow storm on us whle the first night we camped on the Santa Clara which lasted for two nights and one day. The snow was from four to eight inches deep on the divide betwen the Santa Clara and Rio Vergin which is an uncommon thing to be seen at any season of the year. At this divide we commence traveling over a desolate country which might truthfully be called the  desert. We had unusual cold weather while traveling down the Virgin and the sand being wet and sometimes frose caused the wagons to role very heavy which made it hard on the teams and the feed being poor we were oblige^d^ to let the animals run loos nights and although there was a guard through the darkness of the night they would manage to get away nearly every night and some times woul^d^ be found ten miles back on the road and always as far that way as they could get. We arrived at the Muddy on the 24nd ^of Dec^ the place that has been represented as a good place for a settlement but for the life of me I could not see nor immagine where they Land ether for plowing meadow or range could be found neither wood nor timber We saw more Indians at this place than at any other on the road they appeared to be quite friendly We started across the desert on the 3rd 1st and arrived at Los Vegas (called by some at that place Lost Baggis which is a very appropreate name for it) on the 4th  While here I learned that there were divisions, contentions and dissatisfaction among the brethren here and nearly every one were on the point of leaving some to the north and some to Sanbarnadino Callifornia but when bro Jones showed them the letters fro Prest Young which droped Prest Bringhurst from the presidency at this place and placing Bro Samuel Thompson in his place there was quite a change which I hope will be for the better. There is not farming land enough to sustain more than ten families and they would have to farm on a small scale the range is very poor snow fell about 21 inches deep here a few days before we arrived a thing never known before by the oldest inhabitants. We arrived at the Diggins on the 8th which is in a high range of mountains about 350 miles from Los Vegas in a south west course Bro Jones immediately after our arrival commenced to make the necessary preperations to commencing ^to^ melting out the Lead ENDENTRY D.
