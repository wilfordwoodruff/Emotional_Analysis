 Sugar House P. O., Salt Lake County, Utah 1893.    Hon. Wilford. Woodruffe    My Dear Sir:    I desire to formally notify you that I am an aspirant for the appointment of Indian Agent in the   Uintah Agency, Territory of Utah. In presenting my application to the Secretary of the Interior I deem it   most important to secure from the people of Utah their endorsement. With this I wish to say to you, that if you   can consistently lend your endorsement it will afford me much gratification, and if appointed to this responsible   office, it will be my endeavor to fill the same to the best of my ability.    Yours Very Truly,   W. C. A. Smoot, sen    P.S. A letter from you addressed to the Secretary of the Interior is what I would like, believing you to be   acquainted with my early life as a Pioneer of Utah. In early days I had to fight the Indians and afterwards  helped to civilize them, by assisting them to farm and learning them many other things for their benefit, thereby  becoming acquainted with their manners and customs, thus qualifying me, to some extent at least, to fill the   responsible position of Indian Agent to the satisfaction of the President and the people of the United States.

 Pleasant Grove, Jan. 29 [1]893.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother:    Replying to your communication of the 26th  inst., will say that I have no objections whatever to com-  ply with the request made therein. My circumstances and   inclination will not admit of an excuse, to evade the call,   when reflecting upon the circumstances of many of our breth-  ren who are today abroad proclaiming the gospel.    It was with a determination to fulfill all requirements   of this nature, that the Lord may see fit, that I entered the  Seventies quorum,—I trust I shall not falter at the first  request. My health, though not the most robust, I trust  will not interfere with me filling a mission satisfactory to   all concerned. Have, for more than ten years followed   the mercantile business, and through the confinement  connected therewith am rendered somewhat delicate,   though youth is in my favor. Am troubled considerable  with dispepsia, for which reason I should feel favored to be   permitted to labor in that locality where the customary  diet of the people will best agree with my constitution.

Dear Brother: I am in receipt of your letter of Jan ^28^  appointing me as a missionary to Samoa, and wish  to state that I am verry thankful to my Heavenly  Father that I have been considerd worthy to on  such an important mission. I am verry sorry to  state that I cannot accept the mission, and wish  to state to you my reasons for so doing, but should  you wish me to go after reading these I will end-  eavor to arrange my affairs and will go with  pleasure.    A few years ago my dear Mother passed away and  shortly after my dear Father followed hear, leaving  me, the youngest and only boy of the family, alm  all alone, as most of my sisters are not living  hearre. By the provisions of the last Will and Test-  ament of Father there was left to me a small  share of the old Hoamested, and also to my  sisters, with the proviso that should I desire, at  the settlement of the estate, I could buy theier portion

My Dear Brother:    Your kind letter of  Jan. 13th honoring me with a call to  Switzerland and Germany as a missionary  was duly rec'd. I feel to thank the Lord  that His servants have seen fit to call  me into the ministry and cheerfully accept  the call as one of the grandest I  have ever had. Had I had my choice  of fields I should have chosen this  same mission. I would feel that  my duty was unfinished if I were  not to spend some of my life in warning  the world. I will not expect to find it  a bed of roses, but with the help of  the Lord I hope to meet all obstacles

 pg 2    and wich I have since done, but by so doing I was  compelled to borrow some $50000, and give a mortgage  on the farm, to secure the same, as I was almost  almost peniless at the time. This occured last  fall and if I have he^a^lth and strength it will take  me all most about two or three years to clear  the farm of the encumbrance.    If should go on a mission now I would  be compelled to sell the old Hoamsted and when  I tell you that my Dear Father and Mother lived there  about thirty years and, I was borne and raised on  it and that it is as dear and near to me,  almost, as any freiend I have on Earth, I know  you would not want me to part with it.    Under these circumstances, I must decline and  trust you will approve of it and I hope and pray  the Loard will not be displeased by my actions.  My dear departed Father, Mother always taught  me to so live that when I was called to serve the  Lord by going on a mishion I could do so in  an acceptable manner to our Heavenly Father

 and I can honestly say that I have always looked  forward with pleasure, when I should be considered  worthy to be called to serve the Lord by going on  a mission and now that I have been selected  as one to go and preach the Everlasting Gospel  of Christ, and have got to decline, it grieves me more  than words can tell.    If you should release me now, I will endeavor  to so arrange my affairs so that I can be able to  go at the end of two or three years.    I trust that my reasons for declining be statis-  factory to you, and that I will be honorably released.    I remaine as ever your humble servent and  brother Daniel B. Rawson.

He is a good faithful  man, and quite willing to go on a mission if desired to do so, but he has  a wife and six children who are dependent on his labor for their support,  with the exception of an income of about $15.00 per month, derived from  the rental of a house. Sister Engberg has poor health a good deal of the  time, and Bro. Engberg has been afflicted for several years with a weakness  in his legs, which incapacitates him from travelling on foot to any extent,  he sometimes finding it difficult to walk two or three blocks. Notwith-  standing his circumstances and condition, if it is thought advisable that  he should go on this mission, he will cheerfully respond. With kindest  regards,    Very respectfully your Brother,  Robt Morris

Thinks his health  would be better in the old   country as he could get coarse   Bread, he cannot eat fine flour   bread and if his labor could   be changed from california to   the old country without interfear-  ing in the least it would suit   him. But if it cannot be changed  just as well as not he desires   to go any way he does not  wish to make any excuses but   I thought it may be wisdom   in mentioning this fact.    Bro Johnson is an   energetic and faithful man   and is fitted to do a great   amount of good in the mission-  ary labor and I can recomend   him as Such.  if you deem it   and can make the change let him  know So he can make his arang-

 Son, as to whether it is most honorable and   useful to himself and his nation, to remain   in the service of an unbelieving father, for such   earthly reward as that service may bring   him, or to go [acct] in the service of god  to proclaim truth to the world for such  recompence as may be gained in   that higher and nobler service.    If his son takes the same view of   this matter as his father does, we   could readily do without him in  the misisonary field, but if he  esteems the service of god and his   fellow man as greater and better   than the mere temporal service of   an apostate father for a short time   let him express his own choice.

Dear Brethren,    It may be considered presumtion  on my part to write to you, but I am obleiiged  to do so to carry out the wishes of my departed  husband.    We, his family, have always been much   interested in his relation of portions of his history,   especially so in listening to this history from the   time he arrived in Quincy November 1838 until   the expulsion from Nauvoo, in 1846, the sayings of   the Prophet Joseph as he heard them &c    He was a man of remarkable memory and a   staunch defender of the truth of the Gospel, and   we long desired him to write his experience, but   he seldom used the pen consequently did not do it.

 to visit your sick daughter that I  had the pleasure of conversing with   you when you inquired about  Willard's whereabouts and what he  was intending to do.  I stated to   you his intention of fullfilling  his mission to the Southern states  to which he had been called about   the time of his Fathers accident  and ^he^ had ^asked and^ received permission ^after^ to  wait ^his fathers death^ until spring. You replied  "I had forgotten it," and then  added Willard ought not to go  on that mission but ought to  take care of things at home and   let you take the younger boys  where they can be in school.  You also said that if you could  bear it in mind until you  returned home that you would  write him to that effect.  Upon reaching home I found 
 but wished to have it done giving a history and   having it written he was then in his seventy ninth  year. We desired before he left us to preserve   these things in remembrance, that they might be  a benefit to his grandchildren, and this was also   his wish, he was very anxious for their future   knowing full well what was before them.    By the wish of my husband Wandle Mace;   I have undertaken this work, and brought it near  completion according to the ability God has given me.   And he wished me when completed to place it   in the hands of the First Presidency for inspection,  that if there is anything not according to their   wishes or approval it may be expunged, before   it is published.    Dear brethren will you please tell me how to   proceed, when and how shall I place it in your  hands. I should like to be present that I may   hear and answer every enquiry you may wish to make.    Very Respectfully, in the covenant of peace. Your  Sister. Rebecca E Mace.

 will you Kindly answer me  amedatly and oblige    your Brother in the Gospil  George B Jensen    I indorse the above  Jasper Robertson Bishop    To bro Jensen a mission is a very important  and sacred matter which may not occur  but once in his life, but to us the going or  staying of one man for a season, is not so  important, as we have others to call, hence I  would cheerfully give him the time he  asks for, and when he gets ready  let him report.

 Senior President of the 3rd quorum  and when my name was stricken  from the roll as such I was left out  side of the quorums of Seventies.    The last time I met with the  3rd br Joseph Young was present he  said that in consequence of bro  Edmund living so far away from the  City it had become nessary to  appoint some one to take charge  of the quorum in my absence but  when brother Edmund was present  he would be the President of the  quorum while he livid [lived] if he contin  ued faithful.    Now dear brother  I feel grieved to be thus droped  from my quorum yet if it is  right or nessary I feel to say the  will of the Lord be done bro  Seymour will give you all par  ticulars.    Praying the Lord  to greatly bless and preserve you  I remain as ever Yours E. Ellsworth 
 willing to fulfill it  now if so desired. But  if I should not be  wanted at present please  inform me, for I had  promised John Stevens  who is now on a mission  in England that I would   take care of his farm for  two years.    With Kind regards,  Your Brother,    George J. Holyoak.    I would give him more time, and  let him understand, that he is free  to clear himself of obligations, and  prepare himself for a mission, and   when he gets ready, he can so  report.  J. F. S.
