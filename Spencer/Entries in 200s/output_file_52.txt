WoodruffeMy Dear Sir:I desire to formally notify you that I am an aspirant for the appointment of Indian Agent in the Uintah Agency, Territory of Utah. In presenting my application to the Secretary of the Interior I deem it most important to secure from the people of Utah their endorsement. With this I wish to say to you, that if you can consistently lend your endorsement it will afford me much gratification, and if appointed to this responsible office, it will be my endeavor to fill the same to the best of my ability.Yours Very Truly, W. C. A. Smoot, senP.S. A letter from you addressed to the Secretary of the Interior is what I would like, believing you to be acquainted with my early life as a Pioneer of Utah. In early days I had to fight the Indians and afterwardshelped to civilize them, by assisting them to farm and learning them many other things for their benefit, therebybecoming acquainted with their manners and customs, thus qualifying me, to some extent at least, to fill the responsible position of Indian Agent to the satisfaction of the President and the people of the United States.W.

Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother:Replying to your communication of the 26thinst., will say that I have no objections whatever to com-ply with the request made therein. My circumstances and inclination will not admit of an excuse, to evade the call, when reflecting upon the circumstances of many of our breth-ren who are today abroad proclaiming the gospel.It was with a determination to fulfill all requirements of this nature, that the Lord may see fit, that I entered theSeventies quorum,â€”I trust I shall not falter at the firstrequest. My health, though not the most robust, I trustwill not interfere with me filling a mission satisfactory to all concerned. Have, for more than ten years followed the mercantile business, and through the confinementconnected therewith am rendered somewhat delicate, though youth is in my favor. Am troubled considerablewith dispepsia, for which reason I should feel favored to be permitted to labor in that locality where the customarydiet of the people will best agree with my constitution.

This occured lastfall and if I have he^a^lth and strength it will takeme all most about two or three years to clearthe farm of the encumbrance.If should go on a mission now I wouldbe compelled to sell the old Hoamsted and whenI tell you that my Dear Father and Mother lived thereabout thirty years and, I was borne and raised onit and that it is as dear and near to me,almost, as any freiend I have on Earth, I knowyou would not want me to part with it.Under these circumstances, I must decline andtrust you will approve of it and I hope and praythe Loard will not be displeased by my actions.My dear departed Father, Mother always taughtme to so live that when I was called to serve theLord by going on a mishion I could do so inan acceptable manner to our Heavenly Father

We desired before he left us to preserve these things in remembrance, that they might bea benefit to his grandchildren, and this was also his wish, he was very anxious for their future knowing full well what was before them.By the wish of my husband Wandle Mace; I have undertaken this work, and brought it nearcompletion according to the ability God has given me. And he wished me when completed to place it in the hands of the First Presidency for inspection,that if there is anything not according to their wishes or approval it may be expunged, before it is published.Dear brethren will you please tell me how to proceed, when and how shall I place it in yourhands.
