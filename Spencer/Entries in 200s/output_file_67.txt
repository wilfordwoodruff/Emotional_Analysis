 Now we will endeavour to show forth the effects   manifested by the Holy Ghost anciently, and the bless-  ings which flowed from it. Let us turn to Cor. xii.—   The Apostle Paul tells us that no man can say that   Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now, there   are diversities of gifts, or blessings—namely, wisdom,   knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discern-  ing of spirits, diverse kind of tongues, interpretation of  tongues, dreams, visions, &c., &c.; which were all   manifested in the Body or Church of Christ; in which   were set, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors,   teachers, &c., which were given for the perfecting of  the Saints, and the work of the ministry, for the edi-  fying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in the  unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of  God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature   of the fulness of Christ.—Eph. iv.    Having presented before the public, in these pages,   the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it was anciently taught  by Christ and his apostles, which consisted of faith, re-  pentance, baptism for the remission of sins, the gift of  the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and the gifts,  graces, and blessings, which were for the work of the  ministry, and the edifying of the body of Christ; and  which were to continue until that which is perfect should   come; we also wish to say, that as God is an un-  changeable Being, we firmly believe that the same Gos-  pel and plan of salvation, Holy Ghost, gifts, and graces,   are equally necessary for the salvation of men, the edi-  fying of the body, and the work of the ministry, in this  generation, as they were eighteen hundred years ago;  as the Gospel was committed to the Gentiles for the   express purpose of preparing them for the second com-  ing of Christ—which coming is nigh at hand; this is   evident, from the signs of the times.    That the people in this city may be without excuse  in the great and coming day of the Lord; and in order   that our garments may be clear of their blood, we feel   unwilling to close our subject until we bear testimony,   by laying before them, that the Lord has set his hand   again the second time to recover the remnant of his   people, which are of the house of Israel, and with them  the fulness of the Gentiles. And hath also sent a holy  angel, who hath committed the everlasting Gospel, and   restored the priesthood, and sent forth his servants to   cry repentance, and baptism for the remission of sins,  and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and to prune his vineyard

 510  THE DESERET WEEKLY.    vail they would find their records  there, in the great library of the King-  dom of Heaven, and he would like to   have a good account, as he wanted all   of them to have.    After pointing out the important   responsibility resting upon the people   of God, and remarking that the eyes of   the Lord and all the heavenly host  were constantly upon them, President   Woodruff said that God had greatly   blessed them thus far in their mission  here below and would yet give them   the power to accomplish much more,  if they but walked uprightly before   Him, lived in unity, and carried out   the purposes and principles of the   Gospel in their daily life. Whatever   duties we were called upon to perform,  we should fulfil them cheerfully. To-  day the Latter-day Saints who dwelt   in the valleys of these mountains oc-  cupied a very important position in the   world. A great change was taking   place in public opinion toward them,   even in our own nation. They had been   so derided and misrepresented in the   past that people at one time, it would   seem, hardly dared to come into Salt   Lake City for fear that they would   have their throats cut or be otherwise  killed! The object of this people was  to labor for the welfare of their fellow-  men both here and abroad; and this   was what they had been doing all the  way through. The gospel which   they preached would save all   the sons of men under the  heaven who would embrace it and   obey all its laws. The Latter-day Saints  were not the enemies of anybody.   They believed that every man had a   right to his religion, to whatever sect   he might belong, and this people only   claimed in return the same privilege.   That was all they ever had asked.    The speaker referred briefly to the   building of temples by the Latter-day Saints,   and said they had made this  once desert land to bring forth things   in abundance for the sustenance of   man, through the power of God.   Thousands had gone before us here   and thousands would come after; but   the foundation had been laid and we   were building upon it.    In conclusion, President Woodruff   alluded to the ceremony of placing the  cap-stone on the Temple on Wednes-  day. A great deal had been said as to   people going upon the building on that   occasion, but he wished to state that   not one-tenth of that congregation   could go up there. It was de-  sired that all should remain on  terra firma except the very few whose   duty it would be to ascend the building   to perform the necessary work of the   day. He would rather not a soul   went up than that one man, woman  or child should be injured.

 Am Fork July 20 [18]95    Pres.

I would be only to pleased to   go in September if I had the  necessary means. I shall use  every endeavor to go at the earlest  possible date desired. I hope you will  not think that I am trying to neglect  my duties, by asking for farther time   for I am perfectly willing to spend  my time and all that I have for the   furtherance of the gospel. I have  consulted with the Bishop and he  reccomended that I write making the   the above request and explaination.  Hopeing that this will suffice for the  present I remain Your Brother in  the Church of Jesus Christ of Later day  Saints    John H Wootton

 with a mighty pruning, for the last time—in order to   establish permanent peace upon earth, for one thousand   years, during which time Christ will reign upon earth   with his Saints, according to the testimony of John.  The everlasting Gospel must go forth to the nations of   the earth, to seal up the righteous, and to prepare them   for the hour of judgment and dissolution that await the   inhabitants of the earth: because they have transgressed   the laws, changed the ordinances, and broken the ever-  lasting covenant.—See Is. xxiv. 5.    O ye inhabitants of this great city! we call upon you   in the name of Jesus Christ, to repent of your sins and   wickedness, and come forth with broken hearts and   contrite spirits, and be baptized in water for the remis-  sion of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the   Holy Ghost; and be prepared to escape the judgments  of God, which speedily await the world, and will come  upon this generation like a whirlwind, and overtake them  as a thief in the night—according to the testimony of  the angel of God, who hath flown through the midst of   heaven, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give   glory to Him, for the hour of his judgment is to come.—  Rev. xiv. 6.    HEBER C. KIMBALL  WILFORD WOODRUFF.    We are well aware that many persons feel disposed to condemn us,  and to calumniate our characters, by styling us false prophets, and   false teachers, without even taking the trouble to inquire into the   truth of our mission, or concerning the doctrines which we preach;   we would, therefore, call upon all those who are sincere searchers   after truth, to act according to the apostle's advice—"Prove all things  —hold fast that which is good." Solomon says, "He that judgeth a   matter before he heareth it, is not wise." And the Saviour says,   "With what judgment we judge, we shall also be judged—and with   what measure we mete, it shall be measured to us again."    Any person desiring farther information respecting our doctrines,  may obtain our publications at 40, Ironmonger Row, St. Luke's,   London. We would also inform the public, that we preach on the  Sabbath, at Mr. Barratt's Academy, 57, King Square, Goswell Road;  entrance in President Street. Hours—Half-past Two; Half-past  Six. Also on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, at Seven o'clock.

 President Wilford Woodruff said: I feel disposed to occupy a few  moments in bearing testimony to the principles presented unto us by   Elder Penrose. He has referred to the freedom of the soul, to the freedom  of the mind of the Latter-day Saints toward other people. I traveled with   Joseph Smith thousands of miles; have been associated with him and   with the Apostles of our Church almost since its organization. I have  heard Joseph Smith say in public and in private that if he were the   emperor of the world, and had control of every human being on the face   of the earth, he would give every man, woman and child the fullest liberty   to enjoy their religion, and sustain them in it, let that religion be what it  might. Those are my sentiments. We have no contention with any man   on earth because of his religion. Joseph Smith's argument upon this sub-  ject was this: There is no emperor, no monarch, no king, no president  breathing the breath of life on earth who has created his subjects. They  are the creatures of God; He created them; they are His children.    Therefore, neither emperor, president, king nor ruler has the right to   deprive any of his subjects of the right of worshiping God according to   their consciences, for they are held responsible and accountable to their   Creator for their religion, and not to man.    If I had the control of fifty tabernacles, and any preachers of the  Gospel, from any sect under heaven, who had not tabernacles or temples   of their own to go into to give their views, I would be perfectly willing   they should occupy them. If there is a sect or a man on the face of the   earth who has got a truth I do not possess, I want it. Why? Because I   am going into the spirit world, the same as you are. The men whom I   was acquainted with in early days in this Church have almost all passed   away, and I shall follow them very soon myself. This whole congregation,  with all the Christian world, have to pass, in a few years, to the other side   of the veil. Then deception will not answer nor be of any benefit to me.   Any false testimony I may give, or anything I may do subversive of the   will of God towards His creature, man, I shall be held accountable for   before the bar of Almighty God, and so will every other man. Therefore,   while we accord to every man the right to enjoy his own religion, to be-  lieve what he pleases and worship as he sees fit, we claim, as Latter-day   Saints, the same privilege. This is a fundamental doctrine of our faith.    What Brother Penrose has said here to-day is true.

 REMARKS  Made at the Salt Lake Stake Conference,   in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,   Sunday Afternoon, September 2nd,   1894 by  PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    -[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-    The angel Moroni said to the Prophet   Joseph Smith, "Whatsoever enticeth  and leadeth to good and to do  good is of God, and whatsoever doth  not is of that wicked one." That   is a true principle. I wish to make   some remarks upon this, but before   doing so I desire to refer to our meet-  ing this forenoon. There was prob-  ably not one half present this morning   of those who are here this afternoon,   and therefore many may not fully  understand what I allude to.  This is   a Stake Conference, and there was a   report made this morning of the fast   offerings received from the various  wards in the Stake and the amounts   disbursed for the support of the poor.   I think that the report showed that   during the last six months this Stake  alone received from the general tithing  office $14,000 for the support of the   poor. I believe I am sa e in saying that   fifty per cent of all the tithing collected   throughout the mountains of Israel is   returned to the various Stakes for   local expenses, among which is the   support of the poor. I think myself   that this is wrong. As Latter-day   Saints, we should observe our fast   meetings and our fast offerings. We  should at least make a donation of that   which we save by fasting, and give it to   the Bishop for the support of the poor.   It was remarked this morning that some   people said they could not fast because   it made their head ache. Well, I can  fast, and so can any other man; and if  it makes my head ache by keeping the   commandments of God, let it ache. If  we did our duty with regard to the  poor among us the tithing would not   be withheld from the Presiding Bishop-  ric for the support of the poor. In this,  brethren and sisters, I certainly think   we should improve. There is nothing   gained by our attempting to shirk any   duty that God requires of us. We   should be more diligent in attending   our fast meetings. We should fast as  the Lord requires. The Lord does not  ask anything of any man that he can-  not perform. Whenever the Lord   gives a commandment to the children   of men, He provides a way for the   fulfilment of that commandment.    Tithing is a commandment of God to   the people, and should be observed.   The report of what the Relief Society   has done is certainly a great credit to   them.  The amount of means which  they have donated for the support of   the poor in this Stake is a large amount,  considering the labors that there are   upon that Society. I hope we will all   reflect upon these things and not forget  our duty with regard to the fast offer-  ings and the fast meetings, as well as   all other meetings that we are required   to attend.    President Angus M. Cannon referred   to the officers of the Stake not being   present at this Conference. I think if   we all felt as we should, if we under-  stood the signs of the times, we would   take pleasure in attending meetings as   far as possible. The Presidency of the   Church and the Twelve Apostles have   the conferences of the whole Church   to attend, and when they are not here   they are performing other duties.    Now, with regard to the statement I   made in the beginning, "Whatsoever  enticeth and leadeth to good and to do   good is of God, and whatsoever doth   not is of that wicked one." While we   as a people accord to every denomina-  tion the right to enjoy their religion, we   claim the same privilege ourselves. I   have often referred to this, because  perhaps it has appeared sometimes as  though we were encroaching upon   others. This, however, is not the case.   Let us compare the good with the evil  today. Where is there a man, no mat-  ter what sect he belongs to, who cannot   see a great change in the world today?   I remember very well over eighty years   of my life, and I certainly have never   seen such a time in my life in the  United States as I have during the last  year. The spirit of murder, of whore-  dom, of blasphemy that is going like a   flood over the land, and the increase of   crime on every hand, is certainly alarm-  ing. Is it from God? Does it lead to   good? It does not. There is no God   in it. When we look at these things we   can see that there is a power manifest   in our land and among the nations of  the earth that is leading men to do   evil. There is one thing very promi-  nently before my mind, and that is the   unpopularity of God himself, and of   Jesus Christ, and of the Gospel of the   Son of God. In the days of the Savior   there were a good many religious sects,  and they were all at war with the Savior   and His Apostles. They fought against   everything they did, and labored for   their destruction until the Savior and   His Apostles were put to death.  Were   they led by the Spirit of God? They   were not. They were not inspired   to do right; they were seeking to do   wrong. In this dispensation the Proph-  et Joseph was an unpopular man. He   was opposed by the world, and by a  great many men who professed to be   ministers of the Gospel. They labored  against him and to overthrow his   doctrines. Now, if Joseph Smith was   right, his persecutors were not right.   Of course, every man must be his own  judge with regard to that. If Jesus  Christ and the Apostles were right,   then those men who fought against  them were not right.    We are informed by the revelation of   St. John that in the last days there   would be something like six hundred   three score and six different religions  sects and parties in the earth.  Of   course, there could be but one  of them right; for there is but one   right way. There is but one Gospel;   there never was but one and never will   be. That Gospel never deviates from   one generation to another. So with   the Holy Priesthood. The Priesthood   is the same in every generation. When-  ever God has had a people on the face  of the earth, He has had the Priest-  hood among them. In fact, no man   has the right to administer in one of   the ordinances of the Gospel of the   Son of God only by and through the   power of the Holy Priesthood. The  ancient apostles and prophets who ad-  ministered in the ordinances of the   Gospel held that Priesthood.  With-  out that authority they would have had  no right to administer in these ordin-  ances. So in this day, this principle is   the same.    Now, my friends, it does not pay any   man to preach false doctrine or ot  practice false principles, because there   is no salvation in it. It is for salvation   that we labor. For that the Lord   called Joseph Smith to organize the  Church of Jesus Christ once more for   the last time on the earth, so that a  body of people would be prepared for   the coming of the Son of Man. The  Gospel of Christ was with Joseph  Smith. The Priesthood was given to  Joseph Smith by those who held that   Priesthood in the days of Jesus. He   never pretended to administer in one   ordinance until he received the com-  mandment of God to do it. Those   of you who have embraced the Gos-  pel and have lived your religion know  for yourselves that the power of God   has followed this work from the com-  mencement until today. I know it has,   and I know it will if we do our duty.    All the ancient patriarchs and prophets  labored for salvation, for the glory   where God and Christ dwell, that  after death, in their immortal bodies,  they might occupy that position forever.    It paid them to do it, and it will pay  all men to do the same. We cannot   spend our time foolishly in safety. We  have a mission to fulfil.  Some portion   of the Holy Priesthood has been given  to almost every man in the land of

Geo Reynolds Esq:  Dear Brother:  Dec 29th 1894 I received a letter of inquiry  from you asking if it would be agreeable  to my feelings and consistent with my circumst-  ances to go on a mission to the Southern  States, by return mail I wrote you explaining  my circumstances and stating that my  Parents came from Great Britan and that if  it was agreeable I would like my mission  changed. Jan. 9th 1895 you wrote me that  the missionary committee said that I could  have a year or more if necessary to prepare  for my suggested mission, and that when  I was ready to report to President Woodruff,  ant any time after Jan. 1st 1896 I will be  ready to go on my mission either to the  Southern States or Great Britan it makes  no difference to me, tell the committee to use 
 Zion, and to many of them at a very  early age. It has been given to us   that we may administer in the ordin-  ances of the Gospel and in the things   of the kingdom of God. Then let us  try to magnify our callings and to do  our duty. We know the principles   we are practicing are true.  The Lord   has given us power to rear these   temples unto His holy name, that we   may enter in as saviors on mount  Zion and redeem our dead, that they  who have never heard the Gospel   may partake of eternal life. Jesus  himself went to preach to the spirits  in prison, that they might be judged   according to men in the flesh. So do   the apostles and elders of Israel as they   pass away. We labor this side of the   veil, and they labor the other side of   the veil. These things are true. God   has established this Church. He has  raised up prophets and apostles, and   has planted a work in these mountains   of Israel, where this congregation have   been gathered by the power of God.    We have a labor to perform, and if we   do not do it we will be under con-  demnation. I know this is the work   of God. I know the Priesthood is  here, and I know the power of God   has followed this Priesthood since the   Church was organized. Our Elders   have traveled at home and abroad.    They have been taken from the various   occupations of life and thrust into the   vineyard. They have traveled thou-  sands of miles, and that, too, without   purse and scrip, preaching without  price. I never thought of taking any   money with me on my missions. I   have traveled in a good many coun-  tries, and I always traveled without   purse and scrip, and I preached with-  out money and without price.  The   Lord always raised up friends for me   in time of need. I was fed and clothed   and had all the necessaries of life.   That is the way the ancient Apostles   preached. It was the way the Elders  of Israel have had to preach in the day   and generation in which we live.    Brethren and Sisters, I hope we will  look at the position we occupy here  and the work that lies before us, and as   far as we can go into these temples. I  thank God we have a temple upon this  block, where the Latter-day Saints in  this region can enter and redeem their   dead—their fathers and mothers   and their progenitors who have gone   into the spirit world without the Gos-  pel. They never heard the Gospel,   and no man, in time or in eternity, will  ever be saved in the celestial kingdom   of God without the Gospel of Christ.   Therefore, let us look upon these things   as they are. Let us try to live our  religion, that when we get through we   may be satisfied with life. I prayed  many an hour when a boy that the  Lord would let me live to see a prophet   or an apostle, or some man who could   teach me that Gospel which I read of   in the New Testament. I have lived to   see that day, and I thank God for it.   I have tried to do what good I could in   my weak way. I have tried to go into   these temples and redeem my father's   house. With the assistance of my   friends I have been able to do this.   When I go to the other side of the veil   and meet with them, I think I shall be  satisfied, and I think they will. They   will find that these principles are true,   and so will all denominations when they  come in the presence of God. They  will learn then, if not before, that this  is the work of God. I pray God to   bless all who are connected with the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints. May we magnify our calling   and do our duty, that when we get   through and go into the presence of   God and read our history in that great   library in heaven, where the acts of all   men are recorded, we may be satisfied.    God give us wisdom, and lead and   guide us in our duty, that we may over-  come the world, the flesh and the devil,   and inherit eternal life, for Jesus' sake.   Amen. 
 Huntington Utah  Jan 27th 1895    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City  Dear Brother    Your letter of Jan 23rd Notifying me of a  call as a missionary has been received, and accepted,  and if possible I will be ready to leave here about the  10th of March. I have not yet enough money to  take me to my distination. I am doing all I  can to get it by selling property as a sacrifice  and if I cannot have it by that time I  will promise to be ready by the 1st of April  anyhow. I came from Australasia fifteen  years ago, and have relatives living there  now. My education is very limited I can  read and write a little, but through  the kindness of a friend I am getting this  letter wrote, what amound of money will  I need to pay my fare, and other necessary  expenses. Please answer as soon as  possible    Your Brother in the Gospel  John Walker    Peter Johnson, Bp    Rather than sell his property  at a sacrifice, I should  say let him have till Apr or  longer if need be to get ready J.

President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother  I take great pleasure  in recommending Elder John M  Knight and say that he is person-  ally known to me, and that he  is in evry way worthy of the  confidences reprasd [reposed] in him as  shown in the call made on him  to fill a mission.

 The Latter-day Saints are somewhat peculiar from other religious  denominations; one of their peculiarities is this, that no man knows when   he comes into this Tabernacle who is going to speak here. This is true, as   a general thing. This is my personal experience. I have traveled one  hundred and sixty thousand miles in the last sixty years of my life. I   have been in the Church about that length of time. I have traveled   among the nations of the earth, the islands of the sea and in my own   country. I have preached the Gospel, and I have never known, whenever  I arose to speak to the people, what I was going to say. I have been de-  pendent upon the inspiration of Almighty God, as have all the Elders in   this Church. Brother Penrose has remarked concerning our manner of  preaching. Whom has the Lord called, from the creation of the world, to   do this work? He has called, in a great measure, the weak things of this   world. You may trace this in the whole history of the dealings of God   with men. When He wanted a king in Israel, He chose a boy—David, one  of the sons of Jesse. [##1 Samuel 16:1-13##] Who were the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ,  whom He chose to stand by Him and to preach the Gospel? They were  illiterate fishermen. [##Matthew 4:18-22##] Men in this day have been called from the plow, the  plane and the hammer, and the various occupations of life, and thrust into   the vineyard of the Lord. Why have they gone? Because they knew for  themselves—every man has known who has embraced this Gospel and   done his duty—that he has had to depend upon the Lord. That is the   only dependence that we have. I never in my life, except in one or two   instances in my early preaching, attempted to prepare anything to say to   the congregation, and when I did I never touched the subject at all.    I will say to our friends who are present, you see a city here, you see a  tabernacle here. How did this come about? I came here with President   Young, in 1847. We found a barren desert—as barren as the desert of   Sahara. It was in keeping with the name it bore—the Great American   Desert. How is it to-day? There is a city here, and we are building a   Temple. We go into temples to attend to ordinances for the living and  the dead, as has been told us to-day? These Elders of Israel have been  called by the power of God to go forth into the world and preach to their   fellowmen, and they have promised them in the name of Jesus Christ that   all who received this Gospel should receive the Holy Ghost. If this were  not true, and the men and women they baptized received not the Holy   Ghost, could they not have found it out before this time? Had not the   Lord Almighty backed up this testimony of His humble servants, Utah   to-day would be as barren as we found it in 1847, so far as the Latter-day   Saints are concerned. But by the power of God men have received this,  and by His power they have been gathered here.    I will say another thing. The prophecies of Isaiah would have fallen  unfulfilled, as well as the prophecies of many other Prophets, had not   these things taken place. Since the creation of man the Lord has never   brought judgment upon any generation, upon any city, town or country,   that I have ever read of, whenever they have been ripened in iniquity,   until He has fully warned them by men raised up for that purpose, and  they have rejected those men. Take those ancient cities, when they be-

 came ripened in iniquity, the Lord raised up humble, honest men to warn  kings, rulers, and those that inhabited those cities, that the judgments of   God would overtake them if they did not repent. Read the history of  Thebes, of Tyre, of Sidon, of Nineveh, of Memphis, and of Babylon the   great, built to defy all power but God Himself. All that the Prophets  prophesied unto them came to pass to the very letter. There is not a   Christian, a Jew, a "Mormon," or an infidel, or any body else, can point  to a prophecy or a revelation contained in the Bible by any man of God   sent to any of these cities but what has had its fulfillment. Babylon itself  was overthrown, and, in fact, it has been so covered by the drifting sands   of the desert that man can hardly find its foundations to-day.    I wish to say to the Church and to the gentlemen and ladies who visit   us, that we believe we are living in one of the most important genera-  tions God ever gave to man. Read the revelations of St. John. Read the   revelations of Isaiah and the other Prophets. Are they going to fall un-  fulfilled? I tell you nay! they will come to pass. I will say as one man   who has lived a considerable length of time, as men count time, that the   great change I see taking place in the world has an effect upon my mind,   because in it I see the fulfillment of these revelations of God. I lived in   Farmington, Connecticut. I received my first teachings under Dr. Porter,  and under Dr. Haws, of Hartford. They were two reverend gentlemen,   learned men, and they taught according to the light and knowledge of   their day and generation. I used to have peculiar feelings, and I would  ask these gentlemen questions. Said I, "Why is it that you don't contend   for the faith once delivered to the Saints? How is it that you don't have  those gifts and graces tbat were manifest in the days of Christ and His   Apostles?" They told me that these things were given in the dark ages of  the world, to convince the children of men that Jesus was the Christ. But  said they, we are now living in the blaze of the great Gospel light, and we   don't need them. Now, I did not believe that then; I don't believe it   now. That kind of argument I could not comprehend. I agree with   Brother Penrose that whenever the Lord has a Church upon the earth,   and that Church receives the Gospel of Christ, and they enjoy the Holy  Ghost, every gift and grace that ever did belong to the Church of God be-  longs to that Church, no matter who they are nor in what age of the world  they live. These things are true to day, and have been manifest since the  organization of this Church.    We have been called and commanded of God to preach the Gospel of  Christ, or be under condemnation. The Gospel of Christ does not injure   anybody. But there is one strange thing with regard to the inhabitants   of the earth and the Church of Christ. The Apostles, Prophets and lead-  ing men in every age of the world, if they tried to live godly in Christ  Jesus, became unpopular. Even Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who came   to redeem the world, follow him from the manger to the cross, through   suffering mingled with blood, to the throne of grace, and was he popular?   No, He was not. Were the Apostles popular? They were not. The Jews   and Gentiles not only crucified the Savior, but put to death every Apostle   and every man that bore the Priesthood in that day and time, excepting

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  497    GENERAL CONFERENCE    The conference was addressed by   President Wilford Woodruff   as follows: I want to say to my friends   this morning that I am a very happy   man. My heart is filled with gratitude   to God my Heavenly Father for the   blessings I enjoy. It is over seven   years since the Presidency of this   Church and as many of the Twelve   Apostles have occupied this stand   until today, and I feel that we   have all reason to thank God and re-  joice in His name for the blessings   and privileges that we enjoy this   glorious morning. Turning to Apostle   Snow the speaker asked: Is there any   law against a man telling what is in his   heart if he has no evil in it?    Apostle Snow replied that he knew   of none.    President Woodruff -- Brother Snow   says that he does not know of any such   law, and therefore I say God bless Presi-  dent Harrison for exercising his official   clemency in liberating President   Joseph F. Smith, and I am thankful   that Brother Smith is with us today.   I say also God bless every other man,   whether he be Jew or Gentile, Catho-  lic or Protestant, judge or juryman, who   has lent his name to this and not only   liberated President Smith but many of   our brethren who have the privilege of   sitting here with us on this occasion.   I hope there is no harm in that thought   or feeling; for that is the way I do feel   at this time. My heart is full of grati-  tude and blessing to my fellowmen for   all the good they have done. Every-  thing that leads to good and to   do good is of God; and everything   that leads to evil and to do evil   is said to be of the wicked one. I feel   that all of us have reason to rejoice be-  fore the Lord for the deliverance and   blessings which He has wrought   among us. I rejoice in the union   which exists among us as a Presidency   of this Church and the twelve apostles.   These are bodies of men who of all   men under heaven should be united in   the work of the Lord in which we are   engaged. I do not believe there ever   has been a body of men in any age of   the world who, as a general thing,   are more united and happy than   are these today; and while   we are here assembled together I hope   and trust that we may have the inspira-  tion of Almighty God with us in our   teachings, in our instructions, in our   counsels. We shall call upon our   brothers to address us, and I say in   the name of the Lord, let us all have   peace. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    spoke as follows: I realize it is somewhat late, but I want to beg the  indulgence of this assembly a few moments. I felt that as I was a mem-  ber of these Mutual Improvement Associations I wanted to attend this  meeting and hear this lecture. I did not wish to interfere with the time  of Brother Roberts. He has given us an excellent discourse, and has told  us the truth. There are a few things pertaining to this subject on which  I wish to bear my testimony to the young men of Israel.    First, I wish to say a few words regarding Priesthood. There is no mis-  take about the Priesthood of God Almighty. The God of heaven Himself  has created and redeemed this world by the power of that Priesthood;  and no being that ever dwelt on this earth ever has or ever will be able  to do or perform any work pertaining to salvation unless it is by that  eternal and everlasting Priesthood. And where that Priesthood of Al-  mighty God is manifest, the power of that Priesthood is with the people,  no matter what age or generation they have lived in. And I wish to  say that there has been no generation, no dispensation, any greater than  the one in which Joseph Smith was raised up. He laid the foundation of  this great work under God, and He established the Church upon the face  of the whole earth, in fulfilment of revelation and prophecy from Father  Adam down to our day; and the Lord has made, and will make no mis-  take in regard to calling a people or giving them the Priesthood.    As I have said, Joseph Smith organized the Church. He lived but a  short time with us—a little longer than the Savior did after He entered   the ministry. The Savior lived about three and a half years from the 
 172 THE DESERET NEWS April 12    ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF  Recited several instances of the   power of faith, recorded in the Bible,   and said also by that same power   Joseph Smith had been enabled   to accomplish all that he did in lay-  ing the foundation of the great   latter-day kingdom. By faith the   apostles had been able to travel   without purse or scrip tens of   thousands of miles to preach the   Gospel. By faith President B.   Young led this people into the   wilderness, where the savage was   accustomed to roam. By faith, in-  dustry, and the blessing of God   this barren, desert land had been   turned into a fruitful field. Without   the power of God accompanying   the efforts of the Elders, this Terri-  tory would never have been peo-  pled by those we now saw here.   Every one who received the Gos-  pel was under obligation to bear   testimony to the truth. The pro-  phecies of the Bible could not have   been fulfilled, if an angel had not   come to the earth, and brought the   Gospel to the children of men.   Why did God choose that untutor-  ed boy, Joseph Smith, to be en-  trusted with the keys of salvation?   Why did he not choose one of the   popular preachers of the day? Sim-  ply because God could not use   them, for they would sell the king-  dom for popularity, hence he chose   a poor boy, and led him by revela-  tion day by day, until he had com-  pleted the work he was raised up   to do    He then spoke of those who had   never heard the fulness of the ever-  lasting gospel, and the necessity   for temples to be erected, so that   the ordinances of the gospel might   be performed for these in the spirit   world. He addressed a few encou-  raging words to the young men,   also to the members of the relief   societies. 
 ELDER W. WOODRUFF  Spoke of the greatness of the work  in which we, as Elders in Isreal,  were engaged. Those who were  taking a part in carrying forward  the kingdom of God, were ordained  before the creation of the world to   accomplish this work. There never  was a time when the Saints were   so much united in carrying out the   purposes of God as now. We should   go to work of salvation for our dead  might go on. It took jush as much   to save a dead man, as a living one.    The judgments of God awaited   the wicked, all heaven was watch-  ing our movements. They were   not perfect without us nor we with-  out them. It was the kingdom of   God or nothing. If this kingdom   did not prosper, neither did we.  We all had a right to the gifts of   the gospel. Zion would prevail,  Zion would arise and put on her   beautiful garments. No one need  have any fears about this kingdom;  every revelation pertaining to its   building up would fulfilled to  the very letter. We had every-  thing to encourage us. We should  pay our tithing and offerings and   attend to every known duty and   God would be with us henceforth  and for ever.    ELDER W. WOODRUFF  gave an interesting account of the   labors performed in the St. George   Temple from the time of its dedica-  tion until he left.    He said he would rejoice exceed-  ingly to see the time when the Tem-  ple in this city and Logan would  be completed, so that the saints in  this section of country might have  an opportunity of attending to  their baptisms, ordinations for  themselves and their dead, with-  out the necessity of traveling so  great a distance as they now had  to do, to St. George. The work in  the Temple there would be resum-  ed on the 20th of this month. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said:  Before this Conference closes there is  a subject I wish to say a few words  upon. Brother Cannon has to-day  laid before us the truth with regard  to the ordinances of the Holy Gospel,  the revelations of Jesus Christ and  the principles pertaining to the salva-  tion of this people, which are revealed  to us in the Bible, Book of Mormon,  Doctrine and Covenants, and are given  through the living oracles. Paul  says there is but one Gospel, and  "Though we or an angel from heaven  preach any other Gospel than that  which I have preached unto you, let  him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8-9##] Whenever there  has been any baptism from the days  of Father Adam, or Moses, when he  crossed the Red Sea, down to the days  of Jesus Christ, and Joseph Smith,  it has always been the same. There  has never been any change in the  Gospel ordinances, in baptism or  repentance; no change in the princi-  ples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  There has never been any change in  the manner of receiving them; no  change in the reception of the Holy  Ghost. It is so in every age and  generation of the world. There is no  change in the holy resurrection of the  children of men from the grave.  These principles have all been reserved  for us. I wish to say that in my  acquaintance in this Church, I have  seen men, from time to time rise up  and try to be servants of God. They  try to explain things they know  nothing about, to make themselves  appear clever. There is a great deal  of this kind of thing in this age.  There was one of the leading Elders  of the Church who went before the  people and undertook to preach cer-  tain principles. Joseph heard of it  and desired him to present the doc-  trine to him in writing. He wrote it,  and when he completed it read it to  the Prophet. He asked Joseph what  he thought of it. "Why," said Joseph,  "it is a beautiful system, I have but  one fault to find with it—" What is  that, Brother Joseph?" Joseph said—  "It is not true." So I say, every little  while someone, thinking he is smart,  tries to teach something that is not in  the Doctrine and Covenants and  Church works, and which is not true.    I, myself, sat for over two hours  once in a meeting-house, in St Louis,  listening to a prominent Elder of this  Church, who had called the people to-  gether to preach to them the doctrine  of the, what was called, "baby resur-  rection." He preached to two or three  thousand people, and there was not a  word of truth in the doctrine. I  thought he ought to know better. In  the afternoon I was called upon to  speak. After meeting there were a  great many people gathered round  me and asked what I thought of the  man's sermon. I replied, it is all  nonsense. Well, that is just how I  felt. It is no benefit in this world  for men to preach such false doctrine.  And now, every little while, I hear of  some one of the Elders, who wishes  to be considered smart, trying to  teach something they know nothing  about.    The Elders have a world of truth  to preach about. There is enough  revealed to fill the whole earth as long  as you live. Preach the truth as you  understand it. Do not speculate on  things you know nothing about, for it  will benefit no one. If you listen to  false doctrine you will be led away by  false spirits. Remember and observe  this, and you will be all right. Keep  in the paths of truth, and all will be  well with you.    I pray God to bless you, my breth-  ren and sisters. We have had a good  time during this Conference. We  have had many testimonies, and they  are true. Let us lay them to heart,  and be not discouraged. Rely upon  the Lord and you will be all right.  Salvation is here; the kingdom of  God is here, the Gospel is here; the  Zion of God is here; the work of  God is upon the earth. It is being  built up and established. Let us do  our duty, trusting in God, and we will  be brought off triumphant. And when  we get through we will be satisfied  with our labors in the flesh, and the  Lord's dealings with us. I hope we  will so conduct ourselves and carry out  the principles of salvation, that we  may gain eternal life, which may God  grant, in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen. 
 John the Revelator. So in all ages they have been unpopular. So was   Joseph Smith. He laid down his life for the word of God and testimony  of Jesus Christ. He has gone into the spirit world, and he will receive his  reward there. He was a Prophet of God. He laid the foundation of a   great work. It is by that same power that we are here to-day, and the  hand of God is in all these matters. We wish to do all the good we can  what little time we spend in the flesh, and I feel in my heart to say, God  bless you, God bless my friends and those who visit us, and bless all men  that try to do what is right. As long as we do what is right we will re-  ceive the blessings of God. As has been said here to-day, every man,   except the sons of perdition, will receive some kind of salvation. There   is one glory of the sun, there is another glory of the moon, there is another   glory of the stars, and as one star differs from another star in glory, so  also will it be in the resurrection. All of us will be judged according to   the deeds done in the body. We have but a little time to live upon the  earth. If we live to be a hundred years old, it is a very short span when   compared with eternity. We are here upon a mission, and a few of us  have been called to labor in preaching the Gospel. We have done what  we could in this matter, that our garments might be clean from the blood  of all men.    I pray that the spirit of the Lord may guide and direct us, and give us  wisdom in all that we do, that when we go into the presence of God we   may be counted worthy to receive salvation and eternal life, for Jesus'   sake. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE.  -[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 694]-  AFTERNOON SESSION.  2 p.m.    Singing by the choir.    Prayer by Bishop Orson F. Whit-  ney.    The choir sang.    The Sacrament of the Lord's Sup-  per was administered, the priest-  hood of the Twentieth Ward offi-  ciating.    President Wilford Woodruff ad-  dressed the Conference. Following  is a synopsis of his remarks:  I  know not how long I may be able  to talk, but while I do I want the  attention of the congregation. The  Saints have often heard me testify  concerning the power by which this   Church has been established. I   have no power, nor have these apos-  tles, to preach the Gospel and build   up the kingdom of God, except by  the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.   Whatever testimony we bear to be   productive of good, must be by   the Spirit of God. We live in the great-  est of all dispensations, and there  are many things which the Lord    has withheld from the foundation   of the world, and which have never  before been revealed to man, which  will be revealed to the Saints of   this dispensation.    Every dispensation of the Gospel   has had its work, and at no time has  God ever set His hand to do a work   among men, without having an ele-  ment prepared to work with. This   is true of this dispensation. God  has raised up a prophet in this age,  and to him sent messengers who   had once lived in the flesh. The   Lord raised up Joseph who was sold  into Egypt, and who did the work  appointed to him. So the Lord  raised up Joseph Smith, at the time  set for him to appear and perform  His work, and to him He revealed  the same Gospel which was revealed  to Abraham and Moses and to the   prophets. It is the only Gospel   God ever revealed to man. In ful-  fillment of the revelations of St.  John, and other Scriptures, this  Gospel was revealed to Joseph   Smith. It cost him his life to pro-

 time He commenced His ministrations among the people until He was   crucified. Joseph Smith lived some fourteen years, if I mistake not, after   he organized this Church. He also was slain. But before he died he   organized the Church with Apostles, Patriarchs, Pastors, Teachers, and   the whole government of the Church of God; and that Priesthood he  organized or laid the foundations of remained with the people after his  death, as Brother Roberts has said to-night. The Twelve Apostles stood  next to the First Presidency of the Church; and I am a living witness  myself to this work. I am a living witness to the testimony that Joseph  gave to the Twelve Apostles when all of us received our endowments  under his hands. I remember the last speech that he ever gave us before  his death. It was before we started upon our mission to the East. He  stood upon his feet some three hours. The room was filled as with con-  suming fire, his face was as clear as amber, and he was clothed upon by  the power of God. He laid before us our duty. He laid before us the  fullness of this great work of God; and in his remarks to us he said: "I  have had sealed upon my head every key, every power, every principle of  life and salvation that God has ever given to any man who ever lived  upon the face of the earth. And these principles and this Priesthood and  power belong to this great and last dispensation which the God of heaven  has set His hand to establish in the earth. Now," said he, addressing  the Twelve, "I have sealed upon your heads every key, every power, and  every principle which the Lord has sealed upon my head." And con-  tinuing, he said, "I have lived so long—up to the present time—I have  been in the midst of this people and in the great work and labor of re-  demption. I have desired to live to see this Temple built. But I shall  never live to see it completed; but you will—you will." Now, we didn't  suppose but what he would live. We didn't understand what he meant.  Neither did the Twelve in the days of the Savior understand what He  meant when He said "I am going away from you; if I go not the Com-  forter will not come unto you." And so we did not understand Joseph  when he said he would not live to see that Temple completed, but we  would. Probably it was not given for us to understand at that time.    After addressing us in this manner he said: "I tell you, the burden of  this kingdom now rests upon your shoulders; you have got to bear it off  in all the world, and if you don't do it you will be damned." That was  pretty strong language, but it was full of meaning, it was full of signifi-  cance. Joseph was trained in the Priesthood perfectly well before he came  to this planet. He understood the Priesthood perfectly well before he  came here. He understood its work and its lineage. He also understood  perfectly well that he was going away from this earth; but we did not  know it until after he was put to death. I was in Boston with President  Young the very hour he and his brother Hyrum were killed—the very  moment they were slain. And in that moment there was a power of dark-  ness surrounded us, a feeling of heaviness that I never felt before. I have  never seen President Young feel so badly in my life before as he did that  hour.    After that hour we departed for our mission, not knowing anything of

 Forty-First Semi-Annual Con-  ference of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-  Day Saints.    The Forty-first Semi-Annual Confer-  ence convened in the New Tabernacle,  Salt Lake City, at 10 a.m., on this the   Sixth day of October, 1871.    The names of the authorities and  leading elders on the stand being much  the same as published in the minutes of  the Special Conference held yesterday,  it is deemed unnecessary to include  them in these.    FRIDAY, Oct. 6th, 10 a.m.    "Ye wond'ring nations, now give ear."  was sung by the choir.    The opening prayer was offered up  by Elder Orson Pratt.    The choir sang:  "See! all creation joins  To praise th' eternal God."    ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF ad-  dressed the Conference. All of his ex-  perience confirmed him in the faith  that we were entirely dependent on the   Almighty for all things. The servants   of God bore record that the work we   were engaged in was true. They did   not gain this knowledge through hear-  ing others testify to its truthfulness.   Each individual must receive it for  himself or herself, by the inspiration of   the Holy Spirit. This has been the  principle upon which the people of  God in all days had relied. Upon this  principle he could testify that Joseph   Smith was a prophet of the living God,   raised up as an instrument to usher in   the great last dispensation. He had   been intimately acquainted with the   prophet, whom he knew to have been   animated with a fervent desire to bless   and benefit his fellowmen. Joseph   Smith was taught by holy messengers.   These were his teachers, and they in-  formed him that the time had come   for the establishment of the kingdom   of God on the earth, which would   gather people out of every system and   sect in the world. He labored faith-  fully in laying the foundation of the   great work of the Lord until he sealed  his testimony with his blood. Although   he was slain, the principles he sacri-  ficed his life to establish still lived and   flourished.    President Brigham Young was before  the world. He had been acquainted   with him since 1833, and could bear   record, with uplifted hand before heav-  en, that he never had heard him give   any counsel to any person other than   was consonant with principles of peace   and righteousness. His course had   been one of uprightness and justice.   Many then in meeting knew that he   had been a true man in every respect  When the dark days existed among the   Saints at Kirtland, when it was almost  as much as a man's life was worth to   confess that Joseph Smith was a proph-  et of God, Brigham Young upheld and   sustained the prophet. He came   with him to these valleys, when they   presented a barren and uninviting   appearance, and now look at the   great work that had been accom-  plished here, through his untiring en-  ergy and wisdom in the hands of God,   and in connection with his brethren.    He continued speaking for some time  longer, expressing his desires concern[ing]-  the salvation of the human race, allud-  ed to his travels and labors for that pur-  pose, and showed the extent and disin-  terestedness of the labors of the Elders   of the Church in carrying the gospel   to the nations. He explained the relig-  ious rights to which all men were en-  titled, stating that God the Father and   Jesus Christ the Redeemer allowed the   human race perfect liberty in this res-  pect, and no man or class of men had   the least right to curtail it. The con-  stitution of the country guaranteed it   to all. He also discoursed on the patri-  archal order of marriage, explained the  eternal nature of that ordinance, and   the only way by which the social or   family relations formed here could be   binding in the world to come. He was   willing, and so were the great bulk of  the Latter-day Saints, to obey every   good and constitutional law enacted by   the government of our country. With   laws, however, which were designed   to infringe upon his or their rights, as   freemen, he could not say quite so  much.    The building of Temples was men-  tioned by the speaker. The saints   should be energetic in performing that   work, that those sacred and holy ordi-  nances necessary for the salvation of the   dead might be attended to. 
 Heber, City, May 4, 1895.    Wilford Woodruff.    Dear President.    In ascer to your inquiery   how I feal in regard to my   call to suthern states mission.   I can say I feal it my duty   as a Latter day Saint, to   respond to my call made   of me by those placed over me.   I feal pleased that the Lord   thinks I am worthy to go,   and promulgate the Gospel to   those that sit in darkness.   I am not very well poasted in   the scriptures.    But I am willen to go and   tell what I do know,   Bleaving the Lord will   instruct me in many more   princeples pertaining to the   Gospel. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STAR    claim those teachings. It cost  Jesus and the apostles their lives  also. Jesus was a Jew, through the   loins of Judah, yet he incurred the  hatred of the Jewish nation. Is it   not strange that a righteous man  cannot stand up among the people  and not incur their hatred?    There was a war in heaven. Luci-  fer and one-third of the hosts of   heaven rebelled and were cast out.   That warfare has never ceased, but   has been manifested in every dis-  pensation of the Gospel committed   to man. Did Jesus undertake to   please the Jews? No. He was faith-  ful to the mission He had received   from His Father, without regard to   whether the Jews were pleased with  Him or not. The Lord revealed to  Moses and all the prophets of every   age that a Savior would be born to   redeem mankind. In the meridian  of time He appeared, and organized  His Church. The apostles whom  He chose faithfully labored to spread   the work which He introduced. But  it cost a great sacrifice to belong to   the Church of Christ in those days.   The persecution of the Saints was  so great, that at length the last  man bearing the priesthood dis-  appeared from the earth, and the   Church went into the wilderness.  This opposition to the Church will   continue until He comes to reign  whose right it is to reign, and cast   Satan into the place prepared for  him, where he can no more deceive   the nations. There are different   degrees of glory to which men will   attain. The number of men who  will reach the highest is few, for  there are not many who are willing  to make in the flesh the sacrifice  necessary to entitle them to it.    We cannot please the wicked.   In order to do so, every Latter-day  Saint would have to deny every   principle God has revealed to us.  I have been with this Church more   than fifty years. I can testify that  whatever the world may say, Joseph   Smith was one of the greatest proph-  ets that God ever raised up, save  Jesus only.    The Savior said on the cross, of  those who were the cause of His   death, "Father, forgive them, they  know not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##]They  did not know what they did. They   did not comprehend what they   would have to pass through in con-  sequence of having shed the blood   of the Son of God any more than   did the mob who slew Joseph Smith.  The yoke remains on the neck of  the Jewish nation to-day. Our   business is to honor God and serve  Him. Our aim is eternal life. It   will pay any man that ever breathed  to keep the commandments of God   and to be virtuous and upright. I say  to the Saints, "Fear not, little   children; it is your Father's good   will and pleasure to give you the kingdom."    Brother Cannon this morning   delivered one of the most solemn  discourses ever uttered by any man.   What he said was true. I am pained   to see the increase of crime in all   its various and most hideous shapes  in my own and other nations. These  things are noticed by heaven. If  you want to know what is going to  come to pass, read the Revelations   of St. John. They will be fulfilled.  After two-thirds of the inhabitants  are destroyed, the other third will   continue in wickedness and unbelief.  There is no power on earth can  govern the Almighty. No nation   committing sin can escape the judg-  ment of God.    If you are curtailed in any of   your privileges you may know that   God will hold responsible those   who caused the curtailment. Joseph  Smith said if he had power he   would sustain every man and wo-  man on earth in their religious   liberty. I know that this is the Gospel  of Christ, the Zion spoken of by the  prophets, and God will sustain it to  the end of time.  I have never seen  any reason, since I became identi-  fied with the work of God, to desert  it. I bear my testimony to the   Latter-day Saints concerning these  things. I pray that you all may be  faithful. If you are, you will be  satisfied when you get behind the  vail. There are many to-day who  would lay down their lives for the  work of God, if it were necessary.    All classes of men will have to go  into the spirit world, and will finally

 CACHE COUNTY, "the granary of Utah." In that golden chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah, there is no brighter link than Cash  No other county within the Territory can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won-  derful and picturesque suroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied  scenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15  miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand inhabitants, Logan, the county  seat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache County is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be desired, short, mild  winters and the balance of the year such as cannot be excelled. Cache County has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The Agricultural   College, capable of accommodating 1000 students, is a creditable institution and worthy patronage. All lines of business are represented here, such   in the west, "the best show and plow factories, nurseries, etc., all doing a safe and profitable trade. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy   this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en-  joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further.

 this terrible tragedy until we received an account of their death some time  afterwards. We were then informed that the Prophets of God were slain.  We returned to Nauvoo. It has been repeated to you here to-night what   was done at that conference in Nauvoo. I do not know whether there is   any one present here to-night but myself who was there at the conference  —there are but few living who were present on that occasion. Brigham   stepped forth as a leader of Israel, as has been said here to-night by   Brother Roberts, and Sidney Rigdon also tried to get the Presidency; but   when his name was put to a vote before the conference of the Latter-day   Saints, and they were asked if they wanted him as their leader, as their   president, as their guardian to lead them, to guide them and direct them   to the celestial kingdom, Brigham said: "All who do, raise your right   hand," and I did not see a hand raised in his favor in that congregation.    He (Brigham) then asked if they wanted the Twelve Apostles to step   forth and magnify their calling and build up the Church and establish the   kingdom of God in all the earth—"All who do, raise your right hand,"   and almost every soul in that congregation voted; and when Brigham   Young arose and commenced speaking, as has been said, if my eyes had   not been so I could see, if I had not seen him with my own eyes, there is   no one that could have convinced me that it was not Joseph Smith speak-  ing. It was as the voice and face of Jeseph Smith; and any one can tes-  tify to this who was acquainted with these two men.    Several men have claimed authority to lead the Church, but the Prophet  Joseph never conferred any such authority upon any man. The keys of   the Presidency after his death were held by the Twelve Apostles, and by   them only, until the Council of the First Presidency was reorganized.    I name these things to show that the Lord has put His mark of approval  upon the acts of the Apostles who followed the Prophet Joseph Smith in   the establishment of this great work upon the earth; and the Priesthood   shall continue here and the work increase until Jesus Christ shall come in   the clouds of heaven.    I wish here to ask a question.  How has every man who has gone on his  own authority and left the Church and undertaken to build up the Church,  succeeded? How has he prospered, how has he done? Why, just as they  did who tried to establish "Strangism," and "Rigdonism," and every  other "ism" that has ever arisen. They have gone overboard. The  power and influence of God have not been with them; the Priesthood has  not been with them; the Lord has not called them to do that work; they  tried, and the result has been a failure—a complete failure every time.    On the other hand, how has He prospered and blessed those who have  gone forth to the nations of the earth and declared the Gospel of Christ  to the millions upon millions of their fellow men? Why, He has prospered  and blessed them richly, and opened their way to success. Who are they  who have gone forth to the nations of the earth and who have visited the  islands of the sea, and have accomplished this great work of gathering,  built cities and reclaimed the desert? Not those who tried to lead differ-  ent factions from the Church, not those who were ambitious to lead the  people of God; but it has been the Elders of Israel, those who have re-

 ceived the Priesthood from the hands of Joseph Smith and his followers,  or through the authority which God gave them. Who are they who came  here to these valleys of the mountains which had been pointed out by the  finger of God? Who are they who have built these temples and erected  edifices to the great Jehovah? Why, it is the same class of men that was  true to Joseph, those who have been true to God and the covenants they  have made. Has God made any mistake? Read the revelations of the  Almighty; they speak for themselves. The Lord has appointed this  people to come to this land; this is a great work; we are living in a great  dispensation—the dispensation of the last days. The Lord has not de-  ceived any one in this matter; He will deceive no man in regard to this  work. This people have traveled from place to place ever since the organ-  ization of this Church, until to-day they are settled here in the valleys of  these mountains and have prospered and increased marvelously; and they  will continue to grow and increase in strength and power until Christ  comes upon the earth.    A man cannot leave this Church without the power of God leaves him.  It has been the power of the Priesthood that made men great; and no  man can handle it only according to the order of God. If they do they  will fall, as has been stated in the revelations of God read by Brother  Roberts this evening. I want to say to the young men of Israel, go and  do what is right; you need have no fears regarding the authority of this  work. The Lord has called the weak things of this earth. He has called  them from the plow, from the plane and workshop and the hammer—He  has taken the illiterate men of the world and sent them forth to preach  the Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth. Even the Lord Jesus Christ  was born in a stable and cradled in a manger. He came forth and fulfilled  the prophecies. His whole life was one of poverty and affliction. He was  scorned and hated by the world of mankind. His Apostles were selected  from among the poor and the humble of the earth. So it is with the men  who have led the Church in these days. They have been called from  various vocations. They have been men who were humble, and God has  been with them. God has established His work, and He has sent ministers  to the different nations of the earth.    I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints, all that we have to do is to be  faithful, to keep His commandments, to be humble, to seek Him in mighty  prayer, and all will be well with us.    There has been a great deal of work done in this dispensation. The  Lord called this people here to the valleys of the mountains in fulfilment  of prophecy. Old father Jacob, in blessing Joseph and Ephraim, told  them what would take place to them and their posterity to the latest  generation; that their blessings should extend to the utmost bounds of  the everlasting hills. We are here as descendants of Joseph and Ephraim,  and Abraham, who were patriarchs and holy men of God. They had the  Priesthood, and it has been continued and handed down from generation  to generation as long as God has had a people upon the earth. He has  revealed it in this dispensation through the Prophet Joseph, and it is here  to stay, and will remain until Christ comes.

 Elder W. Woodruff. Truly has it been said,   that we are growing in knowledge and wisdom,  and feel the hand of God guiding us; yet this people   have one fault, and that is, to run to a Gentile store   and spend the last dollar they've got, in preference   to going to a brother in the church; it is an error in   Israel, and should be stopped. How long will you   sustain men, who do not support this kingdom, in   preference to supporting yourselves? The men   who draw the very life's blood of the community in   Nauvoo, were the first to draw the steel upon us   and drive us from our homes, and I fear not to say,   that if the saints were to leave these valleys, and the   Gentiles were to take possession of our houses, and   our farms, they could not live here, and a famine   would be in these valleys, in their midst. 
 Joseph Johnson  Dec. 31 [18]95 
 W. WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS,    TO THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.    I deem it to be a duty which I owe to God and his church, to express my feelings   and bear my testimony unto you, concerning certain things that are presented to  you for your consideration; especially, the claims of elder Sidney Rigdon to the  exclusive right to lead and govern the church of Latter-day Saints. I have care-  fully examined the trial which elder Rigdon has had before the authorities of the   church in Nauvoo, as given in the Times and Seasons, Vol. v. No. 17, and I am   satisfied that a righteous decision has been given in his case. I do not make these   remarks without my reasons, and I will hereby give those reasons.    I will commence by asking where has elder Rigdon been since he made his   flaming speech in Far West, which had a tendency to bring persecution upon the   whole church, especially the head of it? Has he stood by the side of the prophet   and patriarch as a true friend, to assist in carrying them through their trials, tribu-  lations, and persecutions? Has he walked up into his place as a man of God, and   stood beside the prophet as his counsellor? Has he in any way, been a pillar or  support to the church, from that day until this? Has he sustained the cause, and   used an influence to spread the work abroad since the persecution in Far West?   Has he in any way sustained the priesthood with dignity and honour, for the last   five years of his life? Or, has the prophet, in any point of view, leaned upon him  as a counsellor, a staff, or support, for the last five years? Or has the prophet  Joseph found elder Rigdon in his councils, when he organized the quorum of the   Twelve a few months before his death, to prepare them for the endowment? And  when they received their endowment, and actually received the keys of the kingdom   of God, and oracles of God, keys of revelation, and the pattern of heavenly things;   and thus addressing the Twelve, exclaimed, "upon your shoulders the kingdom   rests, and you must round up your shoulders and bear it, for I have had to do it   until now. But now the responsibility rests upon you. It mattereth not what   becomes of me." I say, has this been the case with elder Rigdon, in any wise.  No, no, verily no; but the reverse, until he had become like a millstone upon the   back of Joseph Smith, the prophet, seer, and revelator. And I hereby bear my   testimony, that I heard the said Joseph Smith declare, that elder Rigdon had be-  come like a millstone upon his back—a dead weight—and he had carried him long   enough, and must throw him off; and in my hearing requested one of the quorum   of the Twelve to bring him up before the Church, that he might be dealt with  according to the law of the Church, that he might be cut off as a dead branch, and   no longer encumber the tree, as there was sufficient testimony against him. But   through the pleadings of brother Hyrum Smith and others, he has been spared.   Elder Brigham Young has been his friend—spoke in his favour, in consequence of   his age and former standing, hoping that he might reform, get the spirit of the   work, and magnify his calling. Upon this principle he has been sustained long,   until the branch became twice dead, and necessary to be severed from the tree.   Elder Rigdon, for the last five years of his life, has mostly been shut up in the   post-office; confined himself mostly to his own temporal affairs, manifesting but   little interest in the affairs of the church; and when any alarm or report was in   circulation unfavourable to the cause, if we could judge at all from the course he

 REMARKS  By Elder Wilford Woodruff, Bowery, April 8  1857.    (REPORTED BY G. D. WATT.)    I will say to my brethren and sisters that I   count it a blessing and a privilege to occupy a   few moments this morning in bearing my testimo-  ny and expressing my feelings to you; and I hope   what little I may say may be dictated by the Ho-  ly Spirit, for I have lived long enough in this   world to know that I can neither edify myself   nor the children of men without the Holy Spirit.    I have a few thoughts upon my mind which I   wish to present. Since I have attended this con-  ference I have listened attentively to the teach-  ings, counsels, reproof, corrections, testimonies  and subjects which have been given to us by the   servants of God.    It brings to mind the days before I heard 'Mor-  monism.' I have spent hours and days and   nights, among the rocks and in the forest, praying   to Almighty God to enlighten my mind and lead   me in the paths of rectitude and duty and that he  would let me live to behold a people he could   own, who did receive the revelations of Jesus   Christ, the gospel, the principles and covenants   which the ancients received and enjoyed.    The lord revealed to me that I should have this   privilege, and I have lived to see the kingdom of   God set up; it is before me today, in this taber-  nacle, and all the blessings of the priesthood, and   all the covenants and all the power necessary to  lead a people into salvation is here to-day.    I want to say in answer to my feelings, that as   I realize the kingdom of God is here, I realize  also that we have a leader to it. We live in a   great and important day and generation, we live  in the midst of the almighty work of God, in a   time when he has stretched out his hand to accom-  plish that great and mighty work in fulfilment of   the word of God written in the volume of reve-  lation which points to our day.    Any man who has a particle of the Spirit of   God can see that there was great things to trans-  pire in our day. We are in our alphabet: there  are but a few of the works of Almighty God   that have yet been declared in our ears in com-  parison to that which is to come. No man is   qualified to stand at the head of the house of   Israel to carry out the great purposes of our God  unless he is inspired by the Almighty all the time.   We have such men at our head; Joseph Smith   was of that class; From his childhood, or from  the time the angel rent the vail of eternity and   showed him the record of Ephraim until the day  of his death, he was led by the hand of God. No   man had any business to say unto him, why dost   thou so? He was a shaft in the hand of the Al-  mighty.    It is not less so now with President Young,   who stands at the head of this people, for he does   point out the way in which this people should   walk. Who is going to take hold of the Ark and   steady it for him? No man; President Young  has the right to make use of my name or yours   before the people by way of correction; it is not   our business to call him to an account for it; he   has a right to correct, reprove and guide us, and   he has had to do so all the day long, and he has been a  father to this people continually. I have been   acquainted with him and traveled with him for   many years; and I will say I have felt many a   time to thank God that he has given to us fath-  ers as leaders and teachers who have been filled   with mercy and compassion, and with the words of   eternal life.    I have wondered many a time in my life how I   have passed along so smoothly as I have. I have  felt that I have been worthy of correction in a   good many things; yet I desire to pursue a course   whereby I may become justified. I have my   weaknesses, errors and follies, and can see them  by the light of the Holy Spirit.    There is nothing I have ever done in my life   that was wrong but what I have been sorry for.   I know President Young is endowed with the   power of God and so do you know it, and I   know he can discover weaknesses in many of us  and he corrects us for our good. The reproofs of   a friend are far better than the kisses of an enemy.    With regard to correcting the Twelve or any  body else, I am glad when we are corrected   to see the brethren kiss the rod. We have to learn  to build up this kingdom before we are prepared   as polished shafts in the hands of the Lord to   stand up and magnify our calling as Apostles of   Jesus Christ. There is nothing that President   Young brings forth for this people to carry out   but we are all interested in, whether we under-  stand it or not.    Should I, or any man in the kingdom of God  feel for a moment to object to President Young's  handling or controlling gold or wealth for his own   benefit or the rolling of the kingdom? No, we   should not. I wish he had his millions, for he has   clearly manifested before our eyes from the be-  ginning until now his talents and gifts as a finan-  cier; and we all know he has been profitable to  the Church and kingdom of God, to Zion and   this whole people. It matters not to me whether  it is in build a Temple, establishing a Carrying   Company or anything else that is presented for  the accomplishment of the purposes of the Lord   and the building up of his kingdom and the gath-  ering of Israel, we are equally interested in it   and should go to with our might and carry out   the work assigned us.    Many things will be made manifest unto us  and our labors will have to extend through many   channels, ways and means before the way is pre-  pared for the coming of the Son of Man.    I feel thankful to God that his hand is over us.   He has guided, controlled and delivered us from   the hands of our enemies.    We may thank the Lord that we have a man   among us who has got the Holy Ghost enough to   reprove sin whether among his wives or his best  friends or worst enemies. What would become   of this people were it not so? We would go to   hell. No man can govern his steps, control his  life, and correct his errors, if there is not somebody  inspired by the power of God to lead in this   matter.    There is a just cause many times for reproof   and correction, and it is a good sign to me when   we are reproved; It shows there are redeeming   qualities in this people. When President Young   wants anything of us, I care not what, let us re-  spond to his request. We have to build up this   kingdom by union and faithfully following those  men set to lead us, or else we will be scattered;  The blessings of God will be taken from us, if we  take any other course.    The Presidency in their remarks here have re-  ferred to the hatred of the wicked against us.—  Jesus says, ‘I have chosen you out of the world  therefore the world hate you. If you were of   the world, the world would love its own, but be-  cause I have chosen you out of the world, there-  fore the world hate you.'    Look at the world; they are divided on every   point; there is hardly two men or women united in   matters of government or religion. Send an Elder   of this Church to proclaim to them the Gospel of   Jesus Christ and you will see the devils in hell   united with the priests and people of christen-  dom to oppose him. They know they are wick-  ed and weltering in their own corruptions and  abominations. But here comes a man to pro-  claim to them the word of God—why do they   oppose him? Because he has the testimony of   Jesus Christ, and is sent of God. Do the world   believe we have a false religion, that we are de-  ceivers, and have not the true faith? No, they  are afraid that what we preach is too true; they   are afraid of our union in the Valleys of the   mountains; it has more terror in it to the kings of   the earth than any other subject that has been re-  vealed to man in this generation. They are afraid   God is with this people; that he controls them.    The same feeling exists among the nations now   as anciently, when the Jews said He (Jesus) will  take away our place and nation if he is let alone.   This should be a testimony to all the world when   they see the spirit of division increasing upon  almost every subject. They cannot unite upon  any subject only in opposing the Latter Day   Saints.    I feel to say to my brethren and sisters, let us   make up our minds to do right, and let our union   increase, and truly follow the men God has set to   lead us. There is where our salvation lies.    Some of us have been in a measure reproved  and corrected; well, what of it? no doubt we de-  served all we have got and more; we should not   boast over each other because one man is reproved   to-day; you may receive the rod of chastisement  to-morrow.    Let us prepare ourselves so that in whatsoever   we are corrected we may be passive in the hands   of the servants of God and thank the Lord; for   whom the Lord loves he chastens and scourges  every son and daughter he receives.    When I get through, if I can only find myself   associated with the Twelve Apostles of the Lat-  ter Day Saints and with this people, I will be   satisfied. If I can steer my way through this   life, and have a place with you, it is all I will   ask.    I pray the Lord to bless you and me, and more   particularly the Presidency of this church, and   clothe them with the power of God and with sal-  vation, that their hearts may be filled with joy,   light and truth. And may this people rise up and   humble themselves before the Lord and take the   counsel that is given to them that we may be well   educated in the things of God, and be obedient  children in treasuring up their teachings and in   carrying them out, that we may be saved in the   kingdom of God; which is my prayer in the name   of Jesus: Amen. 
 116  THE DESERET NEWS. April 14.    ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF next  spoke: Joseph Smith laid the founda-  tion of a great work that was to be ac-  complished by those who should fol-  low, after. The day has come when the  saints will have to take hold of tempor-  al matters in a proper manner. It has  been said that the introduction of the  true order of temporal things will prove  an antidote to grasping dishonesty.  This is true. We have been enriching  many who would willingly have sold  every member of the Church and  Kingdom of God for a dollar each, and  thought they had made a good   bargain. This should cease. We are  living in a momentous period, a time  when God will bring about His great   purposes. Joseph Smith was commis-  sioned by the Almighty to inaugurate  His great work. His mantle has fallen  upon President Young to carry that  work forward. In the vision of my   mind I can see a mighty people; I can  see the Jews setting their faces East-  ward for the Holy land. May the Lord  so bless us that we may understand our  position. I pray that I may see the  Order of Enoch introduced. I pray  that God may bless President Young,  that he may live to see the accomplish-  ment of that for which he has labored so  many years. 
 DISCOURSE  BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED AT THE  Forty-sixth Semi-annual Conference  of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, in the New  Tabernacle, on the Morning of  Friday, Oct. 8th, 1875.    REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.    "OH Death, where is thy sting? Oh  grave, where is thy victory? The   sting of death is sin, and the gift of  God is eternal life, through our  Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." [##1 Corinthians 15:55-57##]  This doctrine of the resurrection of  the dead is most glorious. It is   comforting, at least to my spirit,  to think, that, in the morning of  the resurrection, my spirit will  have the privilege of dwelling in  the very same body that it occupied  here. As Elders of Israel we have   traveled a great many thousand  miles in weariness and fatigue, la-  boring to preach the gospel of Je-  sus Christ to the children of men.  I would be very glad to have the   same body in the resurrection with  which I waded swamps, swam riv-  ers and traveled and labored to   build up the kingdom of God here  on the earth. I like this, I rejoice   in the privilege we enjoy at this  Conference, of meeting with so   many Latter-Day Saints. I feel  that we have had a good deal of  the Spirit of the Lord with us, and  I hope that it may continue until   we get through, with the Confer-  ence.    President Young referred, yester-  day, in his remarks, to the experi-  ence of some of us in past days. I  have reflected a good deal upon   these things as well as on the fu-  ture. I have long been associated   with the kingdom of God, and I  wish to refer for a moment to what  was said yesterday on that subject.  The mission then mentioned was  one of much interest to the Twelve,   if not to the Church. The whole   of that mission to England, from  the beginning to the end, placed  the Apostles in such a position that  they had to walk by faith from first  to last. The Lord gave a revelation,  with date, day, month and year,   when they were to go up to lay the  corner-stone in Caldwell county,  Far West, Missouri. When that  revelation was given all was peace  and quietude, comparatively, in   that land. But when the time   came for the Twelve Apostles to  fulfill that revelation, the Saints had  all been driven out by the extermi-  nating order of Governor Boggs,  and it was as much as a man's life  was worth, especially one of the  Twelve, to be found in that State;  and when the day came on which  we were commanded by the Lord  in that revelation to go up and lay  the corner-stone of that Temple,  and there take the parting hand   with the Saints, to cross the waters  to preach the gospel in England,   the inhabitants of Missouri had   sworn that if all the other revela-  tions of "old Joe Smith" were ful-  filled, that should not be, because  it had a day and date to it.    President Young asked the  Twelve who were with him—  "What shall we do with regard to  the fulfillment of this revelation?"  He wanted to know their feelings.   Father Smith, the Patriarch, said  the Lord would take the will for   the deed; others said the Lord could  not expect the Twelve Apostles to   go up and sacrifice their lives to   fulfil that revelation; but the Spirit   of the Lord rested upon the Twelve,  and they said—"The Lord God has   spoken, and we will fulfill that reve-  lation and commandment;["] and that  was the feeling of President Young   and of those who were with him!   We went through that State, and  we laid that corner-stone. George  A. Smith and myself were ordained  to the Apostleship on that corner-  stone upon that day. We returned  in safety and not a dog to move his  tongue, and no man shed our blood.    As soon as we got home we pre-  pared ourselves to go on our mis-  sion to England, and, as President  Young has said, the devil undertook  to kill us. I have myself been in   Tennessee and Kentucky for two   or three years, where, in the Fall,   there was not well persons enough  to take care of the sick during the   ague mouths, and yet I never had  the ague in my life until called to  go upon that mission to England.   There was not one solitary soul in  the Quorum of the Twelve but   what the devil undertook to de-  stroy; and, as was said yesterday,   when Brother Taylor and my-  self, the two first of the quorum  ready for the trip, were on hand to  start, I was shaking with the ague,   and I had it every other day, and   on my well day, when I did not   have it, my wife had it. I got up  and laid my hands upon her and  blessed her, and blessed my child,  having only one at the time, and I  started across the river, and that   man who sits behind me to-day,   the President of the church and  kingdom of God upon the earth,  paddled me across the Missouri   river in a canoe, and that is the   way I landed in Nauvoo. I lay   down on a side of sole leather by  the old postoffice, and I did not   know where to go, and I was not  able to stand on my feet, and I lay  down there. By and by the Pro-  phet came along and said he—  "Brother Woodruff, you are going  on your mission?" "Yes," I said,  "but I feel more like a subject for  the dissecting room than for a mis-  sion." He reproved me for what I  said and told me to get up and go.  Brother Taylor, the only member  of the Quorum of the Twelve who   was well, and I traveled together,   and on the way he fell to the ground  as though he had been knocked on   the head with an axe. Old Father   Coulton was carrying us, and Bro-  ther Taylor fell twice in that way,  taken with the bilious fever, and   no man in that quorum could   boast that he went on that mission  without feeling the hand of the  destroyer, for it was laid upon us  all. I had the shaking ague, and   lay on my back in a wagon, and  was rolled over stumps and stones,  until it seemed as if my life would  be shaken out of me. I left Bro-  ther Taylor behind, by his advice,  for said he, "We are both sick, and  if you stay you can't do anything  here;" so old Father Coulton car-  ried me along in his wagon un  til I got to Buffalo, N. Y. From  there I traveled alone to Farming-  ton, Connecticut, my native place,   and I stayed there fifteen days at   my father's house, coughing and  shaking every day. My father  never expected that I should leave  my bed, and my step-mother did   not think that I should ever get   better. A message came from an  uncle of mine, who had just died,   and his last words were—"I want   you to send for Friend Wilford, I  want him to come and preach my   funeral sermon." My father said—  "You can't go and preach that ser-  mon, for you can't sit up in your   bed." Said I—"Never mind, get   up your horse and wagon;" and he  did so and I got into it, and rode  over that morning in a chilly wind,  and the hour that my ague was   coming on I got before a big blaz-  ing fire and preached the funeral  sermon of my friend, and the   ague left me from that day, and I   went back and went on my way re-  joicing.    In process of time Brother Taylor came   along and he and I crossed the ocean to-  gether, and arrived in England, and here  I want to make a little statement of my  experience in those days concerning cir-  cumstances that took place with me.  When Brother Brigham left home he told  you that all his family had was one barrel  of rotten flour. Two hundred cents   would have bought every pound of pro  vision I left with my family when I left  home, But we left our wives, for we had  the commandment of God upon us, and  we were either going to obey it, or die try-  ing. That was the spirit of the elders of  Israel; and I blessed my wife and child  and left them in the hands of God, and to  the tender mercies of our noble bishops,  and those who were acquainted with them   know how it was in those days. However,   I went on my way, and I want to speak   of one little circumstance. I had with me  an old cloak which I got in Tennessee   when traveling with Brother Smoot over  forty years ago. It. had once been a dan-  dy cloak, and had on keg buttons, and   when new had a good deal of trimming   and fancy work about it; but it was then  pretty well threadbare and worn out. I wore  it in Kirtland and I carried it to England  with me; and when I was called by reve-  lation to go to John Benbow's and preach  the gospel I wore that cloak. I went there  and found over six hundred people,   called United Brethren, and among them  were eighty-three preachers, and they, as  a people, were prepared for the word of   the Lord, and I wanted to catch them in   the gospel net. Before embracing the  doctrine of the United Brethren, Sister  Benbow had been what is called a "lady"  in England, and she had worn her silks  and satins; but after obeying the doctrine  of this religious body she cut up and  burned and destroyed her silks and satins  and wore the plainest calicoes she could   get, because she thought that was relig-  ion. When I went there to preach she   looked at me with this old cloak with the   keg buttons on, and the Spirit of the  Lord bore testimony to me that religion,  so far as she was concerned, had a good  deal of tradition about it, and that her   faith could be tried by the coat a man   wore; and as Paul said, if eating meat of-  fended his brethren, he would never eat   any more, so I felt a good deal, and one  morning I went out and cut off the but-  tons from my old cloak, and never had a   button on it afterwards. [##1 Corinthians 8:13##] By doing this  and some other things, which some perhaps  would call foolish, I, through the blessing   of God and with the assistance of Brother   Young, George A. Smith and Willard Rich-  ards, caught the whole flock and baptized  every, soul except one solitary person into   the church and kingdom of God. Many of   them are here in this room to-day, and some  of them have passed away. I mention this  just to show our position. We travelled   without purse and scrip, and we preached  without money and without price. Why?  Because the God of heaven had called up-  on us to go forth and warn the world.    Now I want to say again, I have looked   around within the last few years and I  have thought, Where, Oh where, are the  sons of the Prophets, Apostles, and fath-  ers in Zion, preparing in these last days  to rise up and bear off this kingdom when  we are on the other side of the vail?   Sometimes, in thinking on this subject, I   have felt that they were very few and far  between who had the spirit of their fath-  ers and were prepared to bear off this   kingdom. But I thank God that I find it   is now something like it was in the days  of Elijah. When the Prophet said, refer-  ring to the followers of Baal—"They have  killed thy prophets, and pulled down thine  altars, and I alone am left," the Lord   said—"Oh no, I have seven thousand men  in Israel who have not yet bowed the knee  to Baal." [##1 Kings 19:14-18##] Well, I begin to feel, since I   have heard the testimonies of our young  brethren at this Conference, that some of  the sons of the servants of God are becom-  ing filled with the fire and spirit of the   prophets. We want a good many of  them to rise up and bear off this king-  dom.    Now I want to say a word or two on an-  other subject. I have heard some of our  brethren remark—"If the Twelve apos-  tles have the word of the Lord, we would  like to receive it." I want to say a few   words with regard to the word of the  Lord. I think that many of this people   are mistaken with regard to the word of  the Lord. They sometimes wonder why  President Young does not give them the  word of the Lord. I have been acquaint-  ed with President Young more than forty  years. It is over forty years since I trav-  elled a thousand miles with him, Joseph  Smith, Orson Hyde, Orson Pratt, Charles  C. Rich, and many others perhaps in this  congregation, and I never saw a day from  that day until the present, but what Pres-  ident Brigham Young, even before the  Twelve Apostles were organized, always   had the word of the Lord for the people;   and instead of thinking there is no word  of the Lord, my faith is that there is not   an Elder in Israel who has any business to  preach, unless he has the word of the Lord  to the people. The Twelve Apostles should  have the word of the Lord to the people;  the High Priesthood should have the word  of the Lord to the people; these four   thousand Seventies, the messengers of Is-  rael to the nations of the earth, should   have the word of the Lord to the people;  and every Elder of Israel, when he speaks,  should have the word of the Lord, and   the whole Church and kingdom of God,   men and women, should have, for him-  self and herself, the testimony of Je-  sus Christ, which is the spirit of prophecy.   This should be in the possession of every   man and woman in the church, for their   own government and guidance, and this   has always been the teaching to us of   President Brigham Young. And this is   backed up by the revelations which the  Lord has given in these last days, as you  will find if you read the twenty-second   section of the Book of Doctrine and Cov-  enants. That revelation was given over  forty years ago, to Elders Orson Hyde,   Luke Johnson, Lyman Johnson and Wil-  liam E. McLellin; and on that occasion   the Lord said—"Go forth and preach the  gospel to the people. And when you go  forth you are called to teach the people  and not to be taught. And you must   teach as you are moved upon by the Holy   Ghost, by the power of God, by the Spirit  of the Lord; and when you speak as you   are moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord  your words are scripture, they are the   word of the Lord, they are the mind of   the Lord, they are the will of the Lord  and the power of God unto salvation un-  to every one that hears." [##Doctrine and Covenants 68:1-4##]    Yes, we have plenty of testimony with  regard to these things, and I will say to  my brethren that whatever the word of   the Lord may be to them I know what   the word of the Lord is to me. The word  of the Lord to me is, that it is time for   Zion to rise and let her light shine; and  the testimony of the Spirit of God to me  is that this whole kingdom, this great   kingdom of priests, this forty thousand   men in these mountains of Israel, who  have borne the priesthood, have thorough-  ly fulfilled one part of the parable of the  ten virgins. What is that? Why, that   while the Bridegroom has tarried we have  all slumbered and slept; as a church and  kingdom we have slumbered and slept,  and the word of the Lord to me is that we  have slept long enough; and we have the  privilege now of rising and trimming our  lamps and putting oil in our vessels. This  is the word of the Lord to me.    The word of the Lord to me again, is   that it is time for this whole people, these  forty thousand elders of Israel who dwell   in these valleys of the mountains, and I   believe that it is the word of the Lord to   them, that we listen to the voice of the   Lord through the lawgiver, and unite our-  selves in temporal things, and that we la-  bor to build up the kingdom of God, and   cease to labor to build up ourselves alone,  against the interests of the kingdom of   God. This is the word of the Lord to me  and I think it is to you.    It is the word of the Lord through the   mouth of his servant Brigham, and has  been a long time the word of the Lord to  me, that as Twelve Apostles, as Seventy   Apostles, as High Priests, and as Elders of  Israel, it is time that we should rise up   and bear the burden that rests upon the   shoulders of Brigham Young, who is far ad-  vanced in life, and has had the weight   and burden of this Church and kingdom  upon his shoulders. It is our duty to rise   up and bear off this burden, and lift it  from our President, and also to cry aloud  unto the people to unite themselves to-  gether. It is our duty to cease shaking  in our shoes for fear the Lord Almighty  should give some of his words to govern  and control us in our temporal affairs.  Who, to use a comparison, expects to have  a forty-acre lot alone in the kingdom of   God, or in heaven, when we get there?  None need expect it, for in that kingdom,  in heaven or upon earth, we shall find uni-  ty, and the Lord requires at our hands   that we unite together, according to the   principles of his celestial law.    This is what I consider to be the word   of the Lord to us. It is our duty to unite  ourselves together, and to sustain the in-  stitutions which have been established in  these mountains by the revelations of God  unto us.    There is another word of the Lord un-  to me, and which has been like fire shut   up in my bones for the last three months;  that is, to call upon all the inhabitants of  these mountains, as far as I have an op-  portunity, to go and lay up their grain,   that they may have bread. For the last  three months I have not felt as if I could  answer my own feelings, unless, at every   meeting I have attended, I called upon  the farmers to lay up their grain. "Oh  yes," say some, "Heber Kimball cried,  'Famine, famine' for years, and it has not   come yet." Well, bless your soaul, there  is more room for it to come. "Who am I,  saith the Lord, that I promise and do not  fulfill?" The day will come when if this  people do not lay up their bread they will  be sorry for it. The Lord has felt after us  in days past and gone by the visitations  of crickets and grasshoppers time after   time, and had it not been for his mercy we  should have had famine upon our heads  long before this. It is the duty of the   farmers in these mountains not to sell  their bread, or to throw it away for a song,  but to lay it up, or you will find that the   day is not a great way off when you will  need it. That is the voice of the Lord to  me, and it is the way I have felt for a good  while, and I believe it is the same to my   brethren.    We are living in a very important time,  and the Lord has raised up this people to  accomplish his purposes; and as some of  these revelations convey the idea, they  were chosen from before the foundation  of the world. The Lord says,—"I have   called you by my everlasting priesthood,  and your lives have been hid with Christ  in God," and you have not known it. You   have been called here and God has put in-  to your hands his cause and kingdom, and   the salvation of both Jew and Gentile.   This people hold in their hands the salva-  tion of the twelve tribes of Israel. It was   neot to the oldest son, but to Ephraim, the  son of Joseph, that these promises were   made. [##Genesis 48:13-20##] Joseph was the youngest but one  of the twelve patriarchs, and through his  son Ephraim God has raised you up and  has put this power into your hands, and  you hold the keys for the salvation of Is-  rael. And the ten tribes of Israel in the   north country will come in remembrance  before God in due time, and they will   smite the rocks and the mountains of ice  will flow down before them, and the ever-  lasting hills will tremble at their presence.  A highway will be cast up through the   midst of the great deep for them to come  to Zion, and they will bow down in the   midst thereof, and receive the priesthood  at the hands of the inhabitants of Zion.    Then what manner of men ought we to   be, we, who have been ordained and call-  ed, and had such responsibilities placed   upon us by the God of heaven? Our lives   have been hid with Christ in God, and we  are heirs of the eternal priesthood, through   the lineage of our fathers. Thus saith the   Lord through the mouth of the Prophet   Joseph Smith, who sealed his testimony  with his blood, and his testimony from  that hour has been in force upon all the   world. Know ye, Latter-day Saints, that   the Lord will not disappoint you or this  generation with regard to the fulfillment   of his promises. No matter whether they  have been uttered by his own voice out of  the heavens, by the ministration of angels,   or by the voice of his servants in the flesh,  it is the same; and though the earth pass   away not one jot or tittle of his word will  fall unfulfilled; There is no prophecy of   Scripture of any private interpretation,  but holy men of old spoke as they were   moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and their  words will be fulfilled to the very letter,   and it certainly is time that we prepare   ourselves for that which is to come. Great  things await this generation—both Zion   and Babylon. All these revelations con  cerning the fall of Babylon will have their   fulfillment. Forty-five years ago, in speak-  ing to the church, the Lord said—"You   are clean, but not all, and I am not well  pleased with anv[y] who are not clean, be-  cause all flesh is corrupted before my face,   and darkness prevails among all the na-  tions of the earth." [##Doctrine and Covenants 38:10-11##] This causes silence   to reign and all eternity is pained. The  angels of God are waiting to fulfill the   great commandment given forty-five years   ago, to go forth and reap down the earth  because of the wickedness of men.   How do you think eternity feels to-day?   Why there is more wickedness, a thou-  sand times over, in the United States now,  than when that revelation was given. The  whole earth is ripe in iniquity; and these  inspired men, these elders of Israel, have  been commanded of the Almighty to go   forth and warn the world, that their gar-  ments may be clear of the blood of all  men.    I tell you that God will not disappoint   Zion or Babylon, the heavens or the earth,  in regard to the judgments which he has   promised in these last days, but every one  of them will have its fulfillment upon the  heads of the children of men; and when   they are fully ripened in iniquity the na-  tions of the earth will be swept away as  with the besom of destruction.    What did the Lord say to that meek and  humble man, the brother of Jared, thou-  sands of years ago with regard to the  land of America—a chosen land promised  by old Father Jacob to his sons? He said   that no nation should ever occupy it un-  less the people thereof kept his command-  ments; and if they failed to do that they   should be cut off when they were ripened  in iniquity. The Lord has already swept  away two mighty nations from this conti-  nent, because they have not fulfilled his   word, spoken through that humble man.  The Lord chooses the weak things of the   world, things which are naught to bring to  naught things which are, and he will as   surely perform his work in this age of the  world as he has done in any other. We   need not fear man nor the wrath of man,   but fear God, who holds in his hands the  destinies of all men.    Before I close my remarks, I want to   say a few words to our sisters and daugh-  ters in Zion, for I feel that there are some  words of the Lord to them. This is a  time that the daughters of Zion should  hearken to the words of the Prophet of   God, who has been set to lead us. I feel  that it is time, forty years after they were  organized, that the Female Relief Societies  should labor with all their might to carry   out the object of their organization by   the Prophet Joseph Smith. You may ask,  "What was the object of that organiza-  tion?" I will say that in organizing these  societies there were several objects in view,   some of which I will refer to before I get  through. President Young has been call-  ing upon you, as one branch of the land   of Zion, to take hold and help to build it  up. He desires that the sisters here in the   land of Zion should govern and control  the fashions of Zion. Instead of heaping   to yourselves and imitating the fashions  that have adorned Babylon, you should   have independence enough to form your   own; and those which are not comely and  comfortable should be laid aside. I, my-  self, do not think it has been pleasing in  the sight of God, to see the manner in   which the mothers and daughters in Zion,  for years past, have been ready to adorn  themselves with every fashion that Baby-  lon has contrived and invented. I need  not mention all these things, but I will   mention two or three. For instance, how   is it with regard to the head dress of the  ladies? The Lord has given to women   generally a fine head of hair, which, we  are told in the Scriptures, is the glory of  the woman; and she should let the hair  given unto her adorn her head without  adding any foreign substance, as is now  done, in order to imitate and follow after  the fashions of the world. Again, just as   quick as the daughters of Babylon ex-  tend their crinolines until they cannot   move in a space less than six or eight feet  wide, in a coach, assembly room, or any-  where else, why the daughters of Zion   must follow the same uncomely fashion.  But a fashion the reverse of this is now   adopted, and at the present time the daugh-  ters of Babylon wear their elastics so tight   that they have not room left for   locomotion when walking in the streets;  and, of course the daughters of Zion must  practice the same. And now, see one of   them, dressed in the height of fashion,   crossing the street, and a runaway team  comes thundering along. What a posi-  tion she is in! Why the only way she can  save her life is to lie down and roll across   the street like a saw log.    All these fashions are uncomely and  should be laid aside. The daughters of   Zion should do better than to trail silks  and satins in the mud when walking in   the street. The Female Relief Societies  should lay hold of and regulate these   things, and introduce fashions that are   comely and comfortable; it is their duty  to do it. Again, you can do a good   deal in regard to maintaining the indepen-  dence of Zion, by going to and carrying   out the counsel of President Young in   raising your own silk for dresses, bonnets   and trimmings, so that your adorning  may be the workmanship of your own  hands.    I felt as though I wanted to say so much  with regard to our sisters in Zion. Presi-  dent Young says, and I know it is the   truth, that this is the best people on the  face of the earth. But however good we  may be we should aim continually to im-  prove and become better. We have obeyed  a different law and Gospel to what other  people have obeyed, and we have a differ-  ent kingdom in view, and our aim should  be correspondingly higher before the Lord  our God, and we should [g]overn and con-  trol ourselves accordingly, and I pray God   my heavenly Father that his Spirit may   rest upon us and enable us to do so.    Another word of the Lord to me is that,  it is the duty of these young men here in  the land of Zion to take the daughters of   Zion to wife, and prepare tabernacles for  the spirits of men, which are the children   of our Father in heaven. They are wait-  ing for tabernacles, they are ordained to  come here, and they ought to be born in   the land of Zion instead of Babylon. This  is the duty of the young men in Zion; and  when the daughters of Zion are asked by  the young men to join with them in mar-  riage, instead of asking—"Has this man  a fine brick house, a span of fine horses  and a fine carriage?" they should ask—"Is  he a man of God? Has he the Spirit of   God with him? Is he a Latter-day Saint?   Does he pray? Has he got the Spirit upon  him to qualify him to build up the king-  dom?" If he has that, never mind the   carriage and brick house, take hold and  unite yourselves together according to the  law of God. I rejoice to see the popula-  tion increasing in the land of Zion. Why  is it that ninety-nine women out of every  hundred over the whole land of Zion, who  are of proper age and married, are bring-  ing forth posterity until our children   swarm in our streets almost like bees? Be-  cause the God of he[a]ven is raising up a   royal priesthood, and a generation to bear  off this kingdom in the day when his judg-  ments will come upon the earth. 
 Oct. 16  THE DESERET NEWS  579    ELDER W. WOODRUFF    Said we, as a people, were fulfilling   our destiny, and carrying out those  principles and prophecies that the  ancient prophets foresaw. We had,  therefore, a great responsibility  resting upon us to erect temples,  wherein we might redeem the liv-  ing and the dead.    He gave some good instructions  to the Presidents of Stakes, Bishops  and other officials, and urged upon  them the necessity of each one of  them using all his influence to sus-  tain every co-operative institution,  as a preparatory step towards the   establishment of the United Order,  which would have to be entered in-  to by us as a people. We would  have to be united in all our tempo-  ral labors to promote the principle  of union for the benefit of the   whole people. We were here to  build up Zion, to establish right-  eousness, and prepare ourselves and  our children for the coming of the  Son of Man in the clouds of  heaven. The gospel which we had  received was everlasting in its na-  ture, there was no change, it was  always the same in every dispensa-  tion. Faith, repentance and bap-  tism were eternal principles. He   said that we should remember that   everything which leads to good is  of God, and whatever leads to evil   is from the evil one.    He closed his instructive remarks  by praying for the blessing of God   upon the Saints, that they might  be enabled to carry out the counsel  that had been given them. 
 I want to say to the young men and maidens of the Latter-day Saints,  have no fears from what you hear through the outside world or from those  who are professing to build up the kingdom of God, but who have not got  the Priesthood as established by the Almighty through Joseph Smith. If  you will do your duty all will be right. I am thankful for the privilege of  living so long. I have seen the progress of this work almost from the  commencement. I thank God for what I see to-day. I see great improve-  ment, but there is still great room for improvement among us now.    I wish to say to our young men, here is an evil power, a growing power  of darkness around and amongst us. The power of darkness desires to  lead the young men of Israel astray. They think if they can do this, if  they can get them to do evil and wickedly, they can weaken this Church.  But our young men are raised up to follow in the footsteps of their fathers,  and not to be easily led astray.    I pray God my Heavenly Father to bless the Latter-day Saints, that we  may all have faith in God and in the revelations and promises He has  given, and in all the truths we have received, and if we do so, all will be  well with us. We have come here upon a mission. Our mission is a great  and responsible one; it is mighty. In fact, we have been called to leave  our homes, our fathers, our mothers, our wives, our children, all that is  dear to us, and to go abroad to preach the Gospel to the inhabitants of  the earth. We have been called to do this, and as Brother Joseph Smith  said, if we do not round up our shoulders and help to bear off this king-  dom, we shall be damned. No man can receive the Priesthood from the  hands of the Almighty and abuse it but what it will be answered upon  his head.    Therefore, let us all, old and young, improve the time, live our religion,  have faith in God and His works. The Lord brought us here, His power  has been upon us; by His power and His blessings we have built temples  and beautified homes; and there has never been a people that I know of  that have ever had the power to rear as many temples in so short a time  as we have done in the mountains of Israel. Let us remember this and  be faithful, remembering our fasting and prayers, call upon the Lord in  secret prayer, and ask Him to bless and direct us.    The Lord is with us, His hand is over us, and He is guiding this work  and will continue to do so until Zion shall arise and be built up and shall  stand in beauty and power, and become the glory of the whole earth, while  the judgments of God shall extend throughout the nations.    May God bless you as Mutual Improvement Associations, may He bless  every organization and association that has been established as helps and  governments to this great latter day work; and may we be blessed in all  our endeavors to do right, which may God grant, for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 500 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    President Woodruff followed. He   dwelt for some time upon the re-  sponsibility of the brethren in carrying   the Gospel to all peoples. In the bestow-  al of the Priesthood upon men, the  Lord had said many were called  but few should be chosen, the  reason for many not being among those  of final selection being that they set  their hearts too much upon the things  of this world to the neglect of their  higher duties. He explained the  importance and power that could be  exercised in prayer, and exhorted those  present to take a wise and progressive  course in matters pertaining to the tem-  poral welfare of the people.    President Wilford Woodruff.    After a few prefatory observations,  said he never wished to address any  body of people upon the Gospel of  Christ unless he could do so by the   Spirit and inspiration of Almighty  God; and that was his feeling this   morning.    Those who were at Conference Yes-  terday listened to some very strong  testimonies presented by the Apostles.   There was one discourse in particular  to which he desired now to refer; that  of Brother Abraham H. Cannon, who   alluded to the views of certain per-  sons as to the great mistakes which   had been made in this world, some of  them by people calling themselves  Prophets, Apostles, and Saints of God.   One of these alleged mistakes was in   God permitting Adam and Eve to   partake of the forbidden fruit; another  was the mistake made in the Savior   being born in a stable and cradled in a   manger, instead of his coming   as a conqueror, as the leader  of the inhabitants of the   earth; another was that the Apostles   and Prophets ceased to have revela-  tions when Joseph Smith died. It was   to these principles that he wished to   refer.    When the Prophet Joseph was   called of God to lay the foundation of   this Church and kingdom he was a   mere boy. His first prayer to the God   of heaven was offered when he was   only fourteen or fifteen years of age.   He had read and studied the scriptures  previously and was anxious to know   what religious sect to join. An answer 
 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  MILLENIAL STAR    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  said: We are highly blessed of God in being permitted to meet together  on this the sixty-first anniversary of the organization of the Church of 
 pursued, it had a tendency to increase trouble and disturbance, instead of decreasing   it. It is true, that elder Rigdon attended some of the councils that president   Smith held with the Twelve and others, before his death, while giving them instruc-  tions; but I heard president Smith say, that he came in without his wish or invi-  tation, as he had no confidence in him. Elder Rigden and his friends would now   claim, before the church and the world, that he holds the keys of the kingdom of  God of the last dispensation, above the Twelve, the church, &c. I am ready to   admit before the whole church and the world, that he does hold one key be-  yond the Twelve; one that they do not hold—one that God never held, nor Jesus   Christ, nor any true prophet, patriarch, or apostle; Joseph and Hyrum Smith were  utter strangers to it. And if we can judge from his own mouth, according  to the testimony given on his trial, we would suppose that Lucifer, who made  war in heaven, was its author; and that it had been handed down unto  the present day, and with it elder Rigdon has unlocked his heart, and pour-  trayed before our eyes what was in it. What is it? Hear it, all ye Latter-day   Saints! Listen, O Earth, and judge the fruits of this Key. He threatens to  turn traitor, publish against the church in public journals, intimating that he would  bring a mob upon the church, stir up the world against the saints, and bring dis-  tress upon them, &c. Times and Seasons, vol. v. p. 650—653. This ought to be   a sufficient reason for any true hearted Latter-day Saint to turn away from him  with disgust, and treat all such men and principles according to their desert,  which is, to let them entirely alone; for a more despicable principle never ex-  isted in heaven, earth, or hell, than to prove a traitor to our God, our cause, and   our friends, and bring distress upon the innocent, and that too by turning against   the very cause that a man has spent a portion of his life to build up, and declared,   while in the faith, that it was true and righteous; for in all such cases there is   entirely a misrepresentation of truth and facts, in order to accomplish the intended  evil, while a true statement of facts would advance the cause. This same prin-  ciple was manifest in the case of Lucifer, Judas, Arnold, and many apostates in   this church, who, when they could not get their own ends answered, would   threaten to bring mobs upon the church, and in some instances have done so. I   would ask has Joseph or Hyrum Smith ever held such a key as this, or manifested   such a spirit as this? No, never; they have despised it in their hearts. President   Smith seemed to be sensible that such fruit was growing in the breast of elder   Rigdon; and if he had accomplished what duty appeared to present to his mind   upon that subject, that branch would have been severed from the tree before his   death; but through mercy it was spared until it has produced fruit which is evil in   its tendency, and dangerous to the welfare of the Church and Kingdom of God.    I would again ask, has elder Brigham Young ever manifested any knowledge of   the key above spoken of, or any spirit or disposition to turn against the church in  any time of trial or persecution from its commencement? Has he ever deserted   Joseph, Hyrum, his brethren, or the cause, in one instance, since the foundation of   this church? No, never, in one instance. He has always been ready to go and  come at the bidding of the Lord. He has not said so; but he has always said  come. He has set the example and led the way, until he has traversed sea and   land, at home and abroad, native and foreign countries, until he has borne off the   keys of the kingdom of God in connexion with the Twelve, with honour and dig-  nity, since they were committed to his charge. He has followed President Smith's   footsteps closely for the last twelve years of his life, and especially the last five   years; while elder Rigdon has, at the same time, been confined to the Post-office,   apparently manifesting no interest in the welfare of the church and building up of   the cause. The spirit of wisdom and counsel has manifested itself in the course  and deliberations of elder Young. He has not only had much experience with   president Smith, but he has proved himself true and faithful in all things commit-  ted to his charge, until he was called to hold the keys of the kingdom of God in all   the world, in connexion with the Twelve, was the first to receive his endowment,   from the hands of the prophet and patriarch, who have leaned upon him in con-  nexion with the Twelve, for years, to bear off this kingdom in all the world. And   they have done it with honour, labouring both day and night, making every sacrifice 
 REMARKS  Made by President Wilford Woodruff,   at the St. George Stake Conference,   held at St. George, June 12th and   13th, 1892.    REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER    I arise with a heart full of gratitude   and thanksgiving to my Heavenly  Father for preserving my life until I  again have the privilege of visiting St.  George and beholding the faces of my   brethren and sisters with whom I   stand connected in the new and ever-  lasting covenant—a covenant which  will last not only in this world, but in   the world to come.    I think you are all acquainted with  my motto with regard to public speak-  ing. No man, in this generation or in   any other, can preach the Gospel or   edify the Saints of God unless he is led  by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost;   and what little I may speak to you   this afternoon, I need and desire that   Spirit. I hope I may have the faith   and prayers of the Saints of God unto  this end.    I have some things upon my mind   that I would like to speak of this after-  noon, if I can get the spirit of them.   I will say that some of the most inter-  esting history of my life has been the   time that I have spent here in St.  George, and in the Temple of God   which is built here. There is no eye  that has seen, nor ear that has heard,  nor has it entered into the heart of  man to conceive, the future reward   that will be given these people who   dwell here and who have labored in   the Temple of God. For myself, I can   say that I feel under deep obligation  to the people who dwell here—an obli-  gation that I feel will last with me   throughout all eternity. In my early   days there were two things for   which I desired to live. One was  the redemption of the dead—my  father's house, my mother's house,  and the progenitors who are in the  spirit world, and who never heard the  Gospel.  I have been preserved in the   flesh, as one of their descendants, to  hold the keys of their salvation and   redemption, the same as you have for   your progenitors, whom you are called  to redeem and labor for here in the   flesh. This has been a work that I   have greatly desired to do for years   that are past and gone, and through   the blessing of the Lord and the as-  sistance of my brethren and sisters   who dwell in St. George, I have lived   to see it accomplished to a great ex-  tent, which I look upon as one of the   greatest blessings God ever bestowed  upon me.  So I look upon it with re-  gard to all of us.    The Lord has had certain purposes in   gathering us together, and the redemp-  tion of our dead is one of them. And   when I reflect upon the work which   the Latter-day Saints have been called   to perform in these latterdays, I re-  joice before the Lord that I have lived  in this day and generation, and that   I have been numbered among the Lat-  ter-day Saints who have been called to   perform these great and mighty works   which are necessary to be performed  before the coming of the Son of Man.  The building of these Temples in these  mountains of Israel is among the mar-  velous events of the day in which we   live. Of course, we built Temples be-  fore we came to these valleys; one   in Kirtland, and one in Nauvoo.   I was not at the dedication of the   Temple in Kirtland; but I was present  at the dedication of the Temple in  Nauvoo.  The history of these Tem-  ples you have before you. You know   the Prophets were slain, and the Lord  required the building of that Temple  at the hands of the Saints before they   were driven into the wilderness.    There was a certain revelation given   that inspired in a great measure the  Elders of the Church of God to per-  form that work. They labored with  all the power they possessed, and they  accomplished that work. They went  into that Temple and received ordin  ances and endowments before they   left to go into the wilderness. These   Temples that we have build here stand   as a monument before God, angels   and men, to the faith and works of the   Latter-day Saints.    Brother George Q. Cannon has re-  ferred to your labors in settling here.    You were called to come here by the  servants of God. You left your homes  to come here and you have done what   was required of you in this mat-  ter. You have had power to   finish the Temple, and you have had  power to go in and redeem your dead.   A great many of you have done this,   and I hope all of you will continue as   long as you have any dead to redeem.  Never cease that work while you have  the power to enter into the Temple. I  have greatly rejoiced in my work in   this Temple, and in the blessings that   I have received at the hands of the  Latter-day Saints here. Gold and sil-  ver are no comparison to these things.   I have had some thousands redeemed   here. I have had baptisms, ordina-  tions, washings and anointings, en-  dowments and sealings for them, the  same as if they were standing in the   flesh themselves. I shall go and meet  them on the other side of the veil. You   will go and meet your relatives. You  will hold the keys of their salvation to   the endless ages of eternity, if you at-  tend to this labor for them.    There is no principle on earth that I  rejoice more in than in the power that   we hold as Latter-day Saints to build  these Temples, to go into them, and to   redeem our dead. It will require im-  mortal bodies, immortal spirits, im-  mortal revelations to enable men to   comprehend the full extent of this   work; they cannot comprehend it in   mortality.    Now, I desire to live to see the Salt   Lake Temple finished. I want to be  with my brethren the Apostles, the   High Priests, the Seventies, the  Elders and all the authorities of the  Church when that Temple is dedicated   to God. We have been as long build-  ing that Temple as Moses was leading   the children of Israel through the   wilderness to the land of promise, and   I would like to see it finished.    I view our position as Latter-day   Saints, and all that is transpiring here,  as well as our history before we came  here, as in fulfillment of the revela-  tions of God.  A great many of our  friends felt bad when we had to leave  our lovely Nauvoo to go into the   wilderness. It was a great trial to  them. But had that not taken place,   the Bible and the Book of Mormon and  many of the revelations in the Doc-  trine and Covenants would have fallen  to the ground unfulfilled.  This is the  place pointed out by the finger of God  for the people to stand in holy places   while the judgments of God go forth in   the earth. It is marvelous in my eyes  that I have lived to see the Temples   that have been built in these moun-  tains of Israel and the mighty work  that has been performed in them, con-  sidering the condition in which we   came here. A little handful of men,  in poverty and affliction, came into  this barren desert. I brought   President Young in my carriage   into the valley of Salt Lake.   He was sick, and he asked me to  turn my carriage so that he could get  sight of the valley. I did so. He cast 
 522 THE DESERET WEEKLEY.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF,    in the course of a four minutes' ad-  dress, bore his testimony to the remarks  of President Cannon on the important   subject of temple building. He pointed  to the fact that as the Apostles and dis-  ciples of God in former days were ever   ready to lay down their lives for the   Gospel's sake, so since the day of the  martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph this  people had always been willing to  make similar sacrifices in His   holy name. There were but few  in the world, he said, prepared to obey   the fulness of the Gospel, and that was  why the Latter-day Saints had been  chosen and brought to these valleys  from all nations of the earth. It was  because the true Gospel had been   offered to them and they had received   it. We had been called to go upon   missions, to warn the wicked of the  judgments which were near at hand.  The priesthood belonged to the celes-  tial law, both for time and eternity.    The Lord had made great promises  to all His faithful Saints, from the be-  ginning of this work, and if we re-  mained steadfast to the end these  would all be fulfilled; and no power on   earth or in hell could take from us the  blessings which were in store for the   righteous. We had everything to en-  courage us in the good work which we   had espoused; but the Lord required  much at our hands, and if we united   together and carried out faithfully   that which He asked of us, we should  reap our reward in due season. 
 306 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STAR.    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I feel that we ought to be thankful  before the Lord, that our hearts should be filled with gratitude and  thanksgiving for this privilege which we now enjoy. It is true many of  our friends have been called from our midst during the past year, to the  other side of the veil. The Lord has been merciful to us, as a people, in  preserving us through our history, in all the vicissitudes of life through  which we have been called to pass since the establishment of this Church  and kingdom. I feel that we should lift our hearts in prayer to God our  Heavenly Father for His mercies, and that He will guide and direct us by  the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that our minds may be enlightened, and  our understanding opened to comprehend His mind and will concerning  His people.    I rejoice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in the revelations that come  from heaven to both Jew and Gentile, with the various dispensations of  God to man. Generation after generation has passed away since the  early Patriarchs stood in the flesh on the earth. The Lord has expressed,  through the mouths of inspired men, from generation to generation, His  mind, His will, His work. Those revelations which were delivered thou-  sands of years ago have been fulfilled to-day in our midst and among the  nations of the earth. God has set His hand to establish His work, to  warn the world once more, for the last time, before the coming of the Son  of man, and He has called Elders into the vineyard of the Lord, to labor  while the day lasts; for "the night cometh, when no man can work." We  have the fruits of this labor before us to-day, in this Tabernacle, in the  valleys of these mountains. I trust, while we are together, that our  prayers may be lifted up to the Lord, that our hearts may be united; that  while our brethren, the Apostles and Elders, stand before us and give  unto us their testimony of the word of God, we may have a full share of  His blessing.    I do not think I ought to occupy much more of your time this morning;  but I feel thankful that I am still with you, and able to meet on this  occasion with so many of the Latter-day Saints who have entered into cov-  enant with the Lord, and upon whose shoulders He has laid the holy  Priesthood, to administer, to warn the world, to devote their time and  attention to the ordinances of the House of God, both for the living and  the dead. I feel myself that of all people under heaven that have ever  lived, the Latter-day Saints have the greatest cause to rejoice that they  live in the day and generation when the Lord has set His hand to gather  together His people, to establish both Jerusalem and Zion, and to fulfil  His promises made to Father Abraham and the ancient Patriarchs and  Prophets.    The Jews have been a hiss and a bye-word among the Gentiles since the  death of the Savior, eighteen hundred years ago. Their redemption is at  the door to-day; it has been proclaimed by inspired men to their own  tribe. It is left on record that the Jews will return home, that Jerusalem  will be rebuilt; their temple will be established, and all those great and  mighty promises given by inspiration and revelation will come to pass.    I pray God our heavenly Father to bestow His blessing upon us, that it 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  was the first speaker. The following   is a brief synopsis of his discourse:    He commenced by stating, that he   desired the faith and prayers of the   Saints, because nobody could occupy   the position he now had profitably to  the hearers, without being guided by  the Holy Spirit. There were a few  thoughts on his mind which he would  endeavor to lay before the Conference.   In the first place he would bear his  witness to the truth of the Gospel of  Jesus Christ as revealed in these latter  days, and he did so fully aware of the  fact that he was responsible before the  Almighty as to the testimony he gave.  The Saints were witnesses before the  world and accountable for what they  said, but the world would be responsi-  ble if it rejected the testimony. The  speaker knew that this work was of  God and had been established through  His power. During almost sixty years  he had been connected with the  Church and held the holy Priesthood  and during that time he had traveled  much abroad and at home la-  boring for the spread of the Gospel.  He had seen numerous manifestations  of the power of the Almighty. The  gifts formerly possessed by the Saints  he had seen exercised in this Church.  The Holy Spirit was given to those  who complied with the requirements  of the Gospel. Hence the speaker  knew that Joseph was a Prophet of  God and that this Church was the  work of God.    Concerning revelation, President   Woodruff said the Saints were not  without that divine gift. There were  many men and women in these valleys  who were filled with inspiration, and  the Apostles, when they spoke to the  people by the Holy Spirit, were revela-  tors. The kingdom of God could not   exist without revelations. We might,   however, feel that we wanted more   revelations than we had, to better un-  derstand our position and to accom-  plish the work we were called   to perform. From the time  of Adam to the present hour  no one could be found who ever  preached and administered in the  ordinances of the Gospel without hav-  ing the holy Priesthood. All that  Moses and his successors did, and even  the work done by our Savior, was done  by the power of the Priesthood. This  the speaker illustrated by reference to  the life and death of our Savior.    Christ came in the meridian of time  to the Jewish nation, but that people  did not receive Him. He lived long   enough to teach the gospel and organ-  ize His church. But after this work  was done, He gave Himself up to  death and was crucified by His en-  emies, for whom He prayed, "Father,  forgive them, for they know not what  they do." He had previously chosen  twelve Apostles to be His witnesses.  These were taken not from the prom-  inent men of the nation but from the  lowly and humble, who were willing  to be taught by Him and to do His   will. Something similar had taken place  in our age. The Lord had estab-  lished a dispensation. This was not  for one nation only, but for both   Gentiles and Jews.    The dispensation in which the first  Apostles lived was not permanent. After  the time of the Apostles the Priest-  hood was taken away, the Church was  led into the wilderness, where she re-  mained until the time of the restora-  tion. But the last dispensation was   different from the previous ones. It  was established never to be over-  thrown, in fulfillment of prophecies  given in previous dispensations. In  the sacred Scriptures the history of our  work is already written. There never  was a more important or a greater  dispensation.    Joseph Smith was an illiterate young  man, but he was called upon to perform  this great work, and he had revelations  given to him that were greater than  any we read of given to other prophets.   The speaker had traveled with him for  thousands of miles, and had been an  eye witness to the mighty works he had  performed, and he could therefore not  doubt his divine mission. He had seen  him, by the power of God, heal the sick  and do other marvelous works, and the  Spirit of God rested upon him until his  martyrdom. The Church had there-  fore been organized by the power of   God, with all the gifts and graces that   belonged thereto. A great foundation   had been laid. The Saints were here,  gathered by the power of God. Our  history was known to the world,   and it was comforting to know   that the work that we have to do had   already been foreshadowed thousands   of years ago by holy prophets. Even   the place in which we now dwell was  the one where God wants us to be.   This is the place where the city and  temple of God should be built. What   God has foretold has come true.    Concerning the duties of the Saints,  the speaker said it now was incumbent  upon us to go forth and warn the in-  habitants of the earth of the judgments  to come. For this we were reserved in   the spirit world and had now come   forth upon the earth in these days.   There was a great responsibility rest-  ing upon us in regard to this. The   Prophets Joseph and Hyrum laid the   foundation of this work and received   the crown of martyrs. But on us the   responsibility rested to continue the   work and warn the world.    Speaking of the revelation relating   to the redemption of the dead, President  Woodruff said this was a most comforting   doctrine. Through it we were taught   how the principles of salvation could   be extended beyond the veil and reach  our progenitors. He wished that all   the Saints might have their understand-  ings opened to this great truth. It was  a matter to be thankful for that we had  already been able to build three   temples in this Territory, and we should  be diligent in completing the one now  being erected in this city. Our dead   did not look to the sectarian world but   to us for the performance of the   ordinances connected with their salva-  tion. A vast host of enemies were  arrayed against this work, but the   Lord would sustain us and hold His   hand over us until the work was done  and all His plans and purposes accom-  plished.    The speaker then took up the subject   of home industries, and said that he   would endorse the remarks made on   this subject during the Conference.   The Saints were here to build up   Zion.    With regard to the future, President   Woodruff said, the rising generation  would stand up and carry this work   onward by the power of God. The   right element was there. Our sons, as  a general rule, would not forsake their   God nor their fathers and mothers.   Some of them might go astray, but   there would be found among them   those who could by the power of God   carry out this work. In his early life   the speaker had often read about   Prophets and Apostles and other holy   men and he had wished to live to see   one, and when he heard the Gospel he   felt that his desire had been granted.   He would therefore admonish the   young to give themselves up to the   work of God.    He felt to bless the Saints with all   his heart. He would bless his brethren  of the Apostles and say there was   unity among them. He rejoiced in   contemplating the work of God in   these last days. It was such a work   as was never heard of before.    The speaker closed his remarks by   stating that he was glad that he was   alive yet. He knew he was sustained   by the prayers of tens of thousands of   righteous men and women. He   wished that the Saints might be faith-  ful and true and kind to each other  and that God's blessings might rest   abundantly upon them. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  Said: I have a request I wish to make  to this assembly of latter-day Saints,  as all may not be here this afternoon,  who are here now. There are many  of you from a distance as well as many  who dwell here in the city. You are  expecting to go into the temple to at-  tend its dedication. I have a desire in   my heart that every one of you, the  night before you go into the Temple,  before retiring to rest, will  go by yourselves, in secret   prayer. Offer up your prayers to the   Lord, and pray that your sins may not   only be forgiven, but that you may all   have the spirit of God and the testi-  mony of the Lord Jesus Christ; that  the Spirit of God may be with those   who who assemble in that Temple.    The inhabitants of the earth do not  realize the effect and benefit of prayer.  The Lord hears and answers the pray-  ers of men, women and children.  Prayer has more power, a great deal,  to bring down the blessings of God,  than almost any other thing.    I have the desire for the Saints to   do this, for I wish to see those who go   into the Temple go in with pure   hearts, and that the Spirit of God may    be with them, that they may enjoy   themselves, that they may all feel  the influence of that power while at   the dedication of the Temple.    I pray God to give you all an an-  swer to your prayers, and to give you  the Holy spirit to assist you while at   the dedication and services of the dedi-  cation. Amen. 
 his eyes over the valley and looked for  some little time. When he got   through he said, "Brother Woodruff,   drive on. Here is our home.  This is   the place God has pointed out for us to   plant our feet. I have seen this place   before." He began to recover right  from that time. Well, we camped   there, and we visited around some.   President Young said, "Now, breth-  ren, go where you please; go north, go  south; go to any part of the country,  and when you come back you will say   this is the place." Men came from  California, among them Brannan, who  urged us strongly to go to California,  saying that it was such a fine country,   and we were there in a barren desert.  But President Young said, "This is  our home. Here we shall build the  Temple of God and the city of our   God." I think this has been plainly   fulfilled. The inspiration of the Lord  was with President Young all through  his life, and the result of it is manifest.   I traveled with him in the first settle-  ing of this country. Where is there a   man that has the spirit of inspiration   but can see the hand of God  in these things? We have had   our day of affliction, of perse-  cution and poverty. All earth  and hell, if I may be allowed to use  such an expression, were combined   against the Prophet Joseph Smith,   from the time this Church was organ-  ized until he was slain in the flesh,   and the same spirit continued through  the life of Brother Brigham Young.    But we came to these valleys of the   mountains, and from the day that we   planted our tents in Salt Lake City   there has been a degree of prosperity  resting upon this people, and it has in-  creased year by year until to[d]ay. The  Lord has been with us. Blessings   have been poured out upon the Latter-  day Saints, and we have had plenty of   food and raiment. But I hope that   none of us will get proud and lifted up   in our hearts so that we shall forget  the hand that has given unto us these   things.    This is a dispensation in which the   Lord has set His hand to establish His  Church, to build up His Zion, to warn   the world, to prepare the nations for  the judgments of God, and to prepare  His people to be united together as the   bride, the Lamb's wife. My faith  centres in the promises of God.  There is no power on the face of this   earth that can break this Church. Why?   Because God holds it in His hands.    He is the Author of it, and He has  promised, through the mouths of scores   and scores of prophets, that it shall  stand. It is in fulfilment of these   promises that you are blessed here with   a Temple and have power to enter  therin to attend to the ordinances of   the House of the Lord. And when you   reflect upon these matters, and see how   far these things have been fulfilled,   can you not have faith to believe that   the Lord will carry it out to the end?   I certainly have. I know it is the work   of God. And the Lord has chosen this   people, out of the whole human family,   to stand in the flesh, keep the com-  mandments of God, and go forth to   warn the world by the proclamation of  the Gospel of Jesus Christ that they   may know and understand the judg-  ments of God which await them. The  Latter-day Saints have been working  at this for sixty years, and we have not  got through with it yet. Behold what  is taking place in the earth today! It   really seems as if the day had almost   dawned upon us when there is no other  place of safety for the human family  than the land of Zion. Three elements—  fire, water and wind—seem to have   been chosen to go forth on a mission to   visit the nations. Cities are burned up,   and floods and whirlwinds aweep away  towns and villages and the inhabitants   are destroyed. Are not these things  all proclaimed by the revelations of   Gou [God]? They are, and they will come to  pass.    Brethren and sisters, this is the mis-  sion given to us in the last days. And   that man is a very foolish man who   will divide upon any principle against  the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I have  had more sorrow over one apostate in   this Church than I have in attending  the funerals of all the patriarchs and  prophets and Latter-day Saints that I   ever followed to the grave; because when  I see men and women die who have   been faithful I know they have gained   a victory.  That is the way I feel to-  day. We must work together for the   welfare of Zion.    I am glad to see you and to spend a  few days again in St. George. I want   to do what good I can. I expect we  shall all meet the other side of the  veil with those who have gone before,  and have joy and rejoicing in the Gos  pel of Christ. We should be faithful   to the Lord, and we should not forget  our prayers. Our sons and daughters   should be instructed in these things,   and we should labor for their welfare.   What joy and consolation it gives a   father or a mother to have good boys  and girls, who keep the word of wis-  dom, attend to Sabbath schools, re-  member their prayers, and follow in  the footsteps of their fathers; while it   gives us sorrow when we have sons and   daughters that turn away from this.    But I have hope and faith that the  sons of Zion will rise up and magnify  their callings. I do not believe that   they will disappoint our Heavenly  Father.    Seeing a portion of our gallery oc-  cupied by a quite a number of our La-  manite brethren and sisters, I feel dis-  posed to make a few remarks.    The first time I ever saw Joseph  Smith was in April, 1834. I met him  in the streets of Kirtland. He invited  me to his house. I stopped with him  while preparing to go up to Zion in  Zion's camp. On Sunday he called a  Priesthood meeting. They all gather-  ed in a little cabin. There I first  heard Joseph Smith speak pub-  licly, also Hyrum Smith, Oliver  Cowdery, Brigham Young, Heber C.  Kimball, Parley and Orson Pratt, and  William E. McLellin. The Prophet  called upon the Elders to bear testi-  mony of the Gospel of Christ, and  they arose one after another and bore  a short testimony. Then Brother  Joseph arose and said: "Brethren, I  am very much edified and interested  in listening to your testimony. But I  want to tell you that you know no  more concerning the result of this  work and what lies before you as  the Elders of Israel and before this  people, than a parcel of little children."  I expect they were all a little startled  by it. He told them this work  would fill the whole earth, and  that all nations would have to  hear the proclamation of the  Gospel. He further said: "This work  will fill the Rocky Mountains with  tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints,  and there will be joined with them the  Lamanites who dwell in those moun-  tains, who will receive the Gospel of  Christ at the mouth of Elders of  Israel, and they will be united with  the Church and Kingdom of God, and  bring forth much good." I little  thought, when I listened to those  words, that I should ever live to see  the fulfilment of these words of the  Prophet. I little thought that I should  ever visit the Rocky Mountains, or ever  see the Lamanites of whom he then  was speaking. These men before me  today bring to my mind sayings of the  Prophet. His mind expanded on that  occasion and he had a good deal to  say with regard to the progress of this  work, what the Elders of Israel would  have to pass through, and the work that  God would require at their hands in  the redemption of the Lamanites and  the honest and meek throughout the  world, and in the building up of the  Zion of God on the earth. But I have  lived to see these days. I have lived  to see the Lamanites in these moun-  tains. I have visited a great many  of them—tbe [the] Zunis, Lagunas, Moquis,  Navajoes, Apaches, and a great  many of these Indian tribes. I have  preached the Gospel to them, in con-  nection with my brethren, through in-  terpreters. I have spent many inter-  esting days with these Lamanites in  the mountains of Israel. I spent three  days in the wilderness in Arizona with  Petone, the great war chief of the na-  tion. I preached the Gospel to him.   He called his tribe together, stood upon  his feet some two hours or more, and  told his tribe all that we had said to  him. This tribe was looked upon as a  very dangerous one in the midst of the  nation, and this Petone had engaged in  a great deal of warfare.    I rejoice that I have lived to see this  day; that I have lived to see the  Rocky Mountains; that I have been  gathered with the Latter-day Saints  here. A great deal has been doue [done] by  this people, but much more will have  to be done. We tell sometimes about  dreams. I had a dream one night  about our Temple in Salt Lake. I  thought the Temple was dedicated and  organized, and we as the Elders of Israel  were laboring there for the redemption of  our dead, and suddenly there was a door  opened in the west, and an Indian  chief came into the Temple, leading a  vast host of his tribe, and took posses-  sion of the Temple, and I thought they  performed more work in one hour than  we could do in a day. This made a  strong impression oo [on] my mind. I am  satisfied that although we have done  a little for the Lamanites, we have got  to do a great deal more. I believe I  sealed the first Lamanitish man and  woman together that ever were sealed  in this dispensation. It was in the  Endowment House, and quite a num-  ber of brethren and sisters were pre-  sent. The man's name was Laman.  I believe the day will come when these  Lamanites, with the dark skin that  rests upon them, will enter into these  Temples of the Lord in these moun-  tains and do a great deal of work.  They will come to an understanding of  the redemption of the dead. They

Discourse delivered at the Utah Stake  Conference, Provo, Sunday After-  noon, January 14, 1894, by   PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    -[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.] -    I am pleased to meet with so many of   the Saints of God.  I have listened to   the remarks that have been made at   this conference upon the Priesthood,   and have been very much interested  and edified.  I do not know of any sub-  ject in the Church of more importance  to the inhabitants of the earth and to  ourselves than the Holy Priesthood.  In  listening to Brother F. M. Lyman's re-  marks concerning the Lesser Priesthood  I had many thoughts and reflections.    Some of them I feel to express to the   Latter-day Saints.  There is one prin-  ciple connected with the Priesthood  that I want all Israel to understand, and  that is this:  it makes no difference what  portion of the Priesthood a man holds,  if he holds any at all, he has rights.    Whether he be a Deacon or whether he  be an Apostle, the Priesthood held by  him has rights, on earth and in the  heavens.  In this connection let me   read a paragraph or two from the Book   of Doctrine and Covenants:    Behold, there are many called, but few are  chosen.  And why are they not chosen?    Because their hearts are set so much  upon  the things of this world, and aspire to the  honors of men, that they do not learn this one  lesson--    That the rights of the Priesthood are insepar-  ably connected with the powers of heaven, and   that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled  nor handled only upon the principles of right-  eousness.    That is the principle that we should  understand.  Sixty years ago, the 30th  of last December, I heard the first ser-  mon I ever heard in this Church. The   next day I was baptized.  There were  very few branches of the Church in the  country at that time.  I was ordained a   Teacher.  My mission immediately com-  menced.  I traveled the next spring a   thousand miles with the Prophet Joseph  in Zion's Camp.  I went through that  whole mission as a Teacher. Arrived  in Missouri, several of us stopped at   Lyman Wight's, where we held a  Teachers' meeting.  I remained in that  office until at the conference I was or-  dained a Priest.  I never was ordained  a Deacon.  I was sorry I was not; for I  had a great desire to fill that office.  However, I was not blessed with it.   After I was ordained a Priest I was sent   by the father of Brother Partridge here  on a mission to the southern country.    That was in the fall of 1834.  I had a   companion with me, and we started out  without purse and scrip.  I traveled  alone a good many miles and preached  the Gospel, and I baptized a number  that I could not confirm in the Church,   because I was only a Priest. The first  time I ever met with Brother A. O.   Smoot, was upon that mission.  I trav-  eled some time preaching the Gospel   before I was ordained an Elder.  I was   ordained an Elder under the hands of   Warren Parrish.  Afterwards, by order   of the Prophet Joseph, I was ordained a  Seventy by David Patten, who was mar-  tyred in Missouri for the word of God  and testimony of Jesus Christ.  In 1837   -- the same year that Brother Kimball  went to England and opened the mis-  sion there--I got permission from the  Presidency in Kirtland to go to Fox Is-  lands, being impressed by the Spirit to   go there.  While I was there I was   called by revelation, with several others,  to fill the places of those who were  fallen of the Twelve Apostles.  I have  been some fifty-four years a member of   the Twelve Apostles.  I have traveled   with that and other quorums now for  sixty years; and I want to say to this   assembly that I was just as much sus-  tained by the power of God while hold-  ing the office of a Teacher, and especi-  ally while officiating in the vineyard as  a Priest, as I ever was as an Apostle.    There is no difference in this so long as  we do our duty.    When a man holding any portion of  that Priesthood goes before God, the   heavens are bound to hear him, if he  magnifies his Priesthood; and certainly  it is our duty to go before the Lord and  ask Him for what we want, and when  we do that in faith, God hears and an-  swers us.  God has heard the prayers   of the men who have borne the Priest-  hood from the day that Joseph Smith   received the plates from the hands of  Moroni, and He has fulfilled the prophe-  cies contained in the Bible and the   Book of Mormon.  The Church has   never fallen, notwithstanding her afflic-  tions, her persecutions, her drivings,   and her martyrdoms; but God has sus-  tained it.  When the Lord bestows gifts  upon the children of men in connection  with the Priesthood, those who receive   those gifts are responsible for the use   they make of them.  We are respons-  ible for the use we make of the Holy  Priesthood which has been placed upon  us. Whatever is necessary for us to   receive and enjoy, it is our duty to ask   the Lord for.  We should go before  Him in secret places and make our   wants known, that our prayers may be  heard and answered upon our heads.   Herein lies our strength.  Our trust is  in God, and not in man.  He has com-  mitted this work into the hands of His  Son, Jesus Christ, the Savior of the  world, and this mission has been upon  Him from the days of father Adam.    He was appointed as the great sacrifice  from before the foundation of the world.   He came in the meridian of time and  died for the redemption of man.  We  are engaged in the last dispensation.    We are called upon to build up this   Church and this Zion. And we can   only do it by the power of the Holy   Priesthood.  No man has authority from  God to administer to the children of   men the ordinances of life and salvation  only by the power of the Holy Priest-  hood.  The power of that Priesthood is  with the Latter-day Saints.  When our  brethren go out to the world--I do not   care whether they are Priests, or Elders,   or Seventies, or Apostles -- and they offer   to the Gentiles the Gospel of Christ,   the power of God is with them, as long   as they magnify their calling.  That   power bears record to every honest   man and woman concerning the truth   of the message which these men bear.   By that power men and women have   been pricked in their hearts and the   Spirit of God has borne testimony to   them.  You have found this to be true;  so have I.  Without this power of the   Priesthood, these effects cannot be  manifested to men in the flesh.  I hope  that all Israel will understand this prin-  ciple.  You have not got to wait till   you are an Elder, or a High Priest, or  an Apostle, before God can hear your  prayers.  I know the Lord preserved   my life when I held the office of a Priest.  In one instance a man who sought my  life, without any action on my part fell   dead at my feet, as though he was   struck with a thunderbolt from heaven,   and I attended his funeral the next day.  I had many blessings as a Priest, and   had the spirit and power of God in that  office.    Every man in every office ought to   magnify his Priesthood.  The Deacon  ought to do so.  I was very much  pleased once in seeing a number of   Deacons magnify their calling, down  here at Nephi.  They went through the   city and chopped every piece of wood  which every widow in that town had.    Brother Geo. Teasdale, the President of   the Stake, had three or four cords of   cedar wood in his lot, and he went home  one night and found that it had dis-  appeared.  He wondered what was the  matter; but when he came to look   around he found it all chopped up in his  wood-house.  They magnified their call-  ing splendidly there.    Today we are, in some respects, in   peculiar circumstances.  We should  trust in the Lord and do what is right.   I know the Priesthood is given for the  salvation of men and for the adminis-  tration of ordinances both for the living

Made at the Salt Lake Stake Conference  in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,   Sunday, June 7th, 1896, by  PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    -[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER ]-    I suppose it is expected that while I   live and am able to meet with the Saints  I shall do a little talking and take my   turn with the rest.  I feel disposed to   speak a few moments on this occasion,   if I can get the spirit of it.    I listened to two very interesting dis-  courses here this forenoon by two of the   Apostles.  I was very much edified with   both of them, because they were true.   When the Lord called Joseph Smith as   a prophet, seer and revelator to organ-  ize this church, he organized it for all   time and for all purposes necessary to  prepare the inhabitants of the earth for  the coming of the Son of Man. I think   sometimes that even the Saints of God   almost forget their position, their calling,   their responsibility, and what God re-  quires at their hands. Brother Abraham   H. Cannon referred this morning to the   Mutual Improvement Associations and   conveyed the idea that there was but a   small percentage of our young men in   this Stake of Zion who attended these   associations. Now, I want to say a few  words upon that subject. I want to   have our young men open their ears,  their eyes, their hearts, their spirits, and   look about themselves and understand   where they are and what their position  is. The God of heaven has set His   hand to build up Zion; has set His hand   to purify the earth, and to establish a   people on the earth to be prepared for   the coming of the Son of Man. The   Latter-day Saints who dwell in these   mountains have this responsibility rest-  ing upon them; and no man who has   had the privileges of this Gospel, and   who has parents in the Church of God,   can throw off this responsibility. It is   the desire of the authorities of the   Church and of the parents of these young   men and maidens who dwell here, that   they should rise up and magnify their   calling and fulfill their position in the   earth. There is no other people under   heaven that enjoy the privileges that   the Latter-day Saints have, and that   our sons and daughters have in our or-  ganizations in the midst of Israel. I am   anxious that all Latter-day Saints, from   the Presidency of the Church down to   the last member, should understand   clearly in their minds that the God of   heaven is not trifling with this people, is   not trifling with this generation, nor   with the inhabitants of the earth. All   that He has said, all that He has in-  spired His prophets to prophesy, from   father Adam down to our day, concern-  ing this generation and the inhabitants   of the earth, will have its fulfillment in   the earth. No power can stay the hand   of God in this thing. Blessed is that   man who has got a son that is ready   and willing to go forth to the nations of   the earth and warn the world, to pre-  pare them for the judgments which   await the world, and to save the souls of  men. There is nothing more pleasing   to me than to see our sons willing to go   upon missions, either at home or abroad;   to see them laying the foundation in   their youth and early manhood to be-  come useful in the kingdom of God and   useful in the world at large. Our   Heavenly Father requires this mission   and this warning at the hands of these   Apostles, and the Presidents of the   Church, and the Elders of Israel, and   the Latter-day Saints. We are all held   responsible for the course we pursue in   these things. I have a great anxiety   myself that none of our sons will forsake   the kingdom of God and turn to those   things that are not profitable, sacrificing   the Gospel and the privileges that lie be-  fore us for the sake of the pleasures of   this world. Our sons should not do that.   Our daughters should encourage their   brothers to magnify their calling and to   do their duty in their day and time. Our   Sabbath schools and our Mutual Im-  provement associations should be at-  tended by all the young men in Israel.   The Sabbath schools have a very good   attendance. I think there are nearly   one hundred thousand enrolled in the   Sabbath schools in these mountains of   Israel. I hope that we may pursue that   course ourselves wherein we may be   justified before the Lord.    The hand of God has been manifest   in this Church from its organization un-  til today. Sixty-six years have past   and gone since the Prophet Joseph or  ganized the Church, and hundreds and   thousands have been inspired by the   spirit and power of God to embrace the   Gospel. This spirit was upon me in my   boyhood. The first sermon I heard an   Elder in Israel preach I believed, and   went forth and was baptized. And from   that day to this, I will say before God,  angels and men, in all that I have passed   through in this Church, there never has   been one moment that I have had any   doubt in my mind with regard to the   work of God. I have been in the midst   of leading men, some of whom have   apostatized and turned away; but I have   never seen anything that ever tempted   me to turn to the right or left from obey-  ing the commandments of God or be-  lieving in the revelations of God.    We as Latter-day Saints believe the   Bible; but are we looking for the fulfill-  ment of the Bible? Read the revela-  tions of St. John, and read what is com-  ing to pass in the last days before the   coming of the Son of Man. These  things are beginning to manifest them-  selves in the earth, and they will con-  tinue until the scene is wound up and   prophecy is fulfilled. I will take the   liberty of saying today that what you   have seen going abroad of late in our   own nation and among the inhabitants   of the earth, there is a meaning to it.   Does anybody understand it? Does any-  body comprehend why all of a sudden,   so to speak, these judgments are mani-  fest, laying waste our cities and towns?   This is only the beginning of these   judgments that are going to awake the   world; and they will continue until the   rivers and the seas turn to blood and to   gall, and many of the inhabitants of the   earth will die because of these things.   They have all been portrayed, and they   will be fulfilled.    My brethren and sisters, this work is   upon us. There is no getting away   from it if we expect to gain salvation   and exaltation. It was laid upon Joseph   Smith and those who have followed him   in the Priesthood. We as Elders of   Israel have gone abroad to the nations   in our day and time, and we know for   ourselves, and not for another, that the   gifts and graces follow the Elders of   Israel in our day as they have in the days   of Christ and the Apostles. You all   know this. I do not suppose that there   is a man among us who is not acquaint-  ed with these things. Those gifts and   graces have always followed the Priest-  hood and the administration of the   Elders. The sick have been healed,   devils have been cast out, the blind have   been made to see, the deaf have heard,   the Gospel of Christ has been manifest   in all its power from the beginning of   the Church. If this were not the work   of God, these things would not have   been manifested as they have been. I   am not telling you anything that is new   to you. These things belong to the   Gospel of Christ. They were with the   Apostles of Christ in His day. There is   one thing I have sometimes marveled at  —that Jesus Christ, the Son of the Liv-  ing God, the Savior of the world, with   the great and mighty work which rested   upon His shoulders, only dwelt in the   flesh three years and a half after he   entered into the ministry. Joseph Smith,   who was called to lay the foundation of   this work, spent fourteen years in the   flesh after the Church was organized.   John the revelator, when speaking of   the events that were to take place in the   last days, says:    And I saw another angel fly in the midst of   heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach   unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every   nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,    Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and   give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment   is come.

LIII    DISCOURSE  Delivered at the Weber Stake Confer-  ence, Ogden, Monday, Octo-  ber 19th, 1896, by   PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    -[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-    I am pleased to meet with so many of  our friends this morning, and I feel  desirious to talk to you upon a principle  that I very seldom dwell upon before  the congregations of the Saints. I   have had my mind somewhat exercised   of late on various things, perhaps for   purposes known to the Lord better than  myself, though they are principles we  are all more or less acquainted with.    One of the Apostles said to me years  ago, "Brother Woodruff, I have prayed   for a long time for the Lord to send me   the administration of an angel. I have   had a great desire for this, but I have   never had my prayers answered." I   said to him that if he were to pray a  thousand years to the God of Israel for   that gift, it would not be granted, unless   the Lord had a motive in sending an   angel to him. I told him that the Lord   never did nor never will send an angel   to anybody merely to gratify the desire  of the individual to see an angel[.] If  the Lord sends an angel to anyone, He  sends him to perform a work that can-  not be performed only by the adminis-  tration of an angel. I said to him that   those were my views. The Lord had   sent angels to men from the creation of   the world, at different times, but always  with a message or with something to   perform that could not be performed  without. I rehearsed to him different  times when angels appeared to men. Of  course, I referred to the angel visiting   Joseph Smith. The Revelator John   said that in the last days an angel would   fly in the midst of heaven, having the  everlasting Gospel to preach to them  that dwell on the earth. The reason it   required an angel to do this work was,   the Gospel was not on the earth. The   Gospel and the Priesthood had been  taken from among men. Hence God  had to restore it again.    Now, I have always said, and I want  to say it to you, that the Holy Ghost is  what every Saint of God needs. It is   far more important that a man should  have that gift than he should have the   ministration of an angel, unless it is  necessary for an angel to teach him   something that he has not been taught.    I am going to refer to some of my   own experiences with regard to the   ministration of angels and the opera-  tions of the Holy Ghost. I have never   prayed for the visitation of an angel,  but I have had the ministrations of  angels several times in my life.    One visitation I received in Kentucky,  at the house of A. O. Smoot's mother,  while on my first mission. I went   through Jackson county into Arkansas  Territory, and from Little Rock waded  the Mississippi swamp 180 miles to get  across into Tennessee. I arrived in   Henry county, Tennessee, on the west,  at the same time that David Patten and   Warren Parrish landed in that region   on the north. We met and labored  together for awhile and built up some  churches there. I then held the office of   a Priest. I traveled thousands of miles  and preached the Gospel as a Priest,   and, as I have said to congregations   before, the Lord sustained me and   made manifest His power in the defense  of my life as much while I held that   office as He has done while I have held  the office of an Apostle. The Lord sus-  tains any man that holds a portion of the  Priesthood, whether he is a Priest, an   Elder, a Seventy, or an Apostle, if he  magnifies his calling and does his duty.    I will give you an instance of the   Lord's protecting care over me while I   was a Priest. I had this experience   while in Arkansas with my companion,  who was an Elder. There was a man  in that country who with his wife and  five sons had been in Jackson county.  His wife died there. The old gentleman  was in the faith apparently when he left  there. He was driven out, the same as   the rest of the Saints were, and some o[f]  his sons were whipped with hickory   gads in the persecution there. I knew he  was in this Arkansas country, and I felt  anxious to go and see him, as he was   the only Latter-day Saint that we knew   anything about in that region. The  night before I got there I had a peculiar   dream. I dreamed that an angel ap-  peared to us and pointed out a certain   path that we must follow, and that the  b[l]essings of God would attend us in   following that path. As we went along  this path we came to a log cabin with a   wall on each side ten or fifteen feet high.  This road led right through that build-  ing. When I went to the door and   opened it, it was full of large serpents.   My companion said he was not going  into that room for anybody or anything.  "Well," says I, "I am, or I'll die trying.  The Lord told us to follow that path,   and I am going to walk in it, unless I  am stopped by some power that I know  not of" I stepped into the door.  These serpents all arose up ready to  jump on me, and there was a very large  one in the middle of the floor that made  a pass at me. It appeared to me as   though I would be destroyed, but when  the serpent reached near to me it   dropped dead; in fact, they all dropped   dead, and they turned black and burst   open, after which they took fire and   burned up, and both of us went through  safely. The morning after, we arrived  at this man's house. His name was  Akeman. It was Sunday morning, and  we went into the house. Mr. Akeman   and his daughter were at breakfast.  His sons were settled in cabins around  him. We sat down, but there  seemed to be a peculiar spirit in  the place. I finally stepped up to   the mantlepiece, on which I saw a Book   of Mormon. I picked it up, and said,   "Brother Akeman, you've got a very  good book here." He said, "It's a book   that came from hell." I then began to   understand a little of what lay before  us. He had apostatized. He cursed  everything and everybody—Joseph  Smith, Lyman Wight, the Apostles and  a good many others whom he named.  He was very angry. I inquired about  his sons. He said they were settled   around him there. Well, we took up   our valises and left. I looked up one  of his sons—the youngest, I believe,  and the only one that was in the faith,   and he was like a drowning man; but   by praying with him we got the Spirit   of the Lord in him, and we had a pretty  good time with him. We told him of  our experience at his father's, and I said  we were desirous to have some meet-  ings there if we could. He said he did  not know; his father had apostatized  and was at war against everything that  was Mormon. He told us, however,   where an old gentleman lived close by   to whom he had loaned the Book of   Mormon. He was an aged man and his   wife was an aged woman. Their name  was Hubbard. We went to see them and  they were very glad to receive us. In   the morning my companion said he was  going to leave the place. Of course, he  was an Elder, and I was only a Priest,   and we generally suppose that the lesser  should obey the greater; but I said to   him, calling him by name, "You are not   going to leave here, nor I either; we   shall both of us stay here till I see the  fulfillment of my dream. It is here, and  I am going to stay and see it, and you   will, too." It is not natural for me to   take a stand of that kind, but I felt led  to do it upon that occasion. We stopped  there three weeks, and cleared land for   father Hubbard, while he fed and housed   us. Three times while we were there  I was warned of the Lord to go and   warn this Mr. Akeman. The last warn-  ing I received from the Lord was on   Saturday night of the third week. I   went up to his house which was about  three quarters of a mile distant, and   when I got there his daughter stood in   the doorway. I walked in and saluted   him. He was walking the room, but  did not say anything to me. I told him   the Lord had sent me to pay him a visit. 
 will have wisdom given unto   them. They will have light   and truth given unto them,   and the spirit of their forefathers will   be manifest unto them. I am   thankful that I am able to see   these Lamanites here. The Prophet  of God saw what would come to pass,  and he told the truth. As Elders of  Israel we have fulfilled, in a measure,   many of the Prophet's sayings in rela-  tion to these things. We have traveled  to the nations of the earth, as he said   we should do, and this Gospel has   gone to a great many nations. More   doors will be opened in the due time of   the Lord. When these judgments of   God are manifest in the earth, the  honest in heart and meek of the earth   will have their eyes opened and they   will be very glad to flee to Zion. I look   back to the days when we first went   to New England to preach the Gospel,   and when there were Saints in almost   every city there. And when we went   to England in 1840 we baptized over   seven thousand in one year. So it has   been more or less through the world.   There have been people prepared to   receive this Gospel and to work for the   Lord. And we are only in the begin-  ning of this work, as it were. The day   will come when many will seek a place   of safety, that they may stand in holy   places while the judgments of the Lord   pass. Our young men will rise up in   those days. They will remember their   prayers before the Lord. Their minds   will be opened to see the work that lies   before them. A great deal has yet to   be done, although the Lord will make  short His work in the earth, lest no  flesh be saved. I am thankful that   there is as much done as there is;  thankful that we have had the privi-  lege of opening our mouths among the   nations of the earth and the islands of   the sea, and preaching the Gospel.   What greater work can any man be   engaged in than the saving of the  souls of men? No matter how poor  we may be, it is a glorious work and a   blessing to any man. When I look  upon the Apostles and the Elders and   bring to my mind the labors they have  performed, the miles they have trav-  eled, the souls of men they have   brought into the Gospel, I feel that it is  a work worthy of all acceptation of   angels or men.    I pray the Lord that we may have   power to convert these Lamanites to  the Gospel of Christ. It is true it has   been a hard work up to the present to   get their minds open to comprehend   these things, though many of them   have been baptized; yet a great work   is to be done among them. Our   brethren should remember this, and   treat them kindly. Let us do what we  can to make them happy and comfort-  able while we are with them. It is  our duty to do what we can for their  benefit, and to give them the Gospel.   God bless you and guide you in the   ways of life. Amen.

Dear Breathern: Allow  me at this time to call to your  minds a fact that might never  enter there otherwise. In the early  days of Utah the Church was  in very straight circumstances  and mutch had to be done by  its members. Those who were  selfish or not able to live any  other way had a living from  the Tithing oOffice; But there are  some who worked hard for  years and got no remuneration,  who had their heart so in the  work that they even sold their  homes to get bread for 
 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STAR. 307    may continue to rest upon His Saints who have entered into covenant  with Him; that we may recognize our responsibility and magnify our  calling day by day, so that when we pass to the other side of the veil we  may be justified in His sight. This is my prayer and desire for Jesus  Christ's sake, Amen.

 2  THE DESERET WEEKLY.    Yes, the hour of God's judgment is   come. The Lord raised up Joseph  Smith through the loins of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob, and Joseph and Eph-  raim, and He gave unto him this work;  He put into his hands the Book of Mor-  mon, which was hid up in the Hill   Cumorah by ancient Moroni. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] All the  powers of earth and hell apparently   sought to destroy him while he held that,  so that it should not be translated; but  God delivered him, and he lived to trans-  late the work into the English language,   and since then it has been translated in-  to a great many languages and publish-  ed to the world. The Lord also gave   unto him this Book of Doctrine and   Covenants, containing the grandest re-  velations that God ever gave to man.   He lived to reveal that to the Church of  God and to the world as well as to tran-  slate the Book of Mormon. He accom-  plished this great work in a short time,  and then laid down his life for the word  of God and testimony of Jesus Christ.   He has gone home with the rest of the  martyrs, awaiting the coming of the Son  of Man and beholding the judgments of  God laying waste the inhabitants of the  earth, in fulfillment of revelation and  prophecy.    Brethren and sisters, my feelings are  that we ought to improve our time, and  do what we can, no matter what the   world says of us or what is reported   about us. We have our duties to per-  form, and we have got to build up the  kingdom of God. This is our duty   while we dwell in the flesh, and when  we get through we will lie down and   sleep in death, and go into the spirit  world and, if we are righteous, mingle  with those faithful ones who have gone  before us and prepare for the coming of  the Son of Man. My prayer to God is   that we may have power to magnify our  calling, as Apostles of the Lord Jesus  Christ and Elders of Israel, and to do   our duty. We have but one life here.   Some of us may live longer than others;   but it matters not whether this life be   long or short, we will be held respon-  sible for what we do while we dwell in  the flesh. I pray God to inspire the   hearts of our sons and daughters, that   they may comprehend the importance   and the worth of the salvation of the   souls of men, and of attending these   Sabbath schools and these improvement  meetings, and that we all may make a   right use of these gifts and graces while  they are in our hands. I feel to ask God  for His blessings to rest upon us as the   Presidency of the Church, the Twelve   Apostles, and all the quorums of the   Priesthood. I feel to ask God to bless  our sisters who are laboring in the Pri-  mary Associations, the Improvement As-  sociations, and the Relief Societies, and   in all the capacities in which they are  called to labor, as well as the brethren,  in the building up of the kingdom of   God. Amen 
 642 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    Then he made some exclamation that  was rather profane. I sat down and   commenced warning him. I told him  that he had apostatized from the Gos-  pel of Christ; he had had the Priest-  hood and he was pursuing a course that  would send him to destruction, and the   judgments of God would overtake  him. Well, he raged like a demon.   That is about all I said to him. I cer-  tainly did not stay long, but I delivered  my message. When I left the house he  followed me, and when he came to   where I was he fell dead at my feet as   though he had been struck with a thun-  derbolt from heaven. He was a very   large man and he turned as black as an  African, and his skin seemed almost to  burst open. The next day I attended   his funeral. But he had raised a mob  and had sent word for them to come  and drive us out of the country or hang   us, and they had sent warnings to us to   leave. The consequence was, there   were some fifteen or twenty deaths dur-  ing my stay there. Men were taken  with what was called pleurisy. Doctors   came in and opened a vein, and they   died in five minutes. One of these  men sent for me, and I went and saw  him. Two men were holding him. He  said to me, "I wish you would cut open  my side; I have a pain here and it is   skin deep; yo[u] can cut it out and save   my life." I looked at him, but did not   say anything to him. I said to myself,  "If your eyes were open, you would see   the angel of death standing by your   side." He died while I was there.   After this my partner left me, and I   went alone to Memphis, Tennessee, and  met with Brothers Patten and Parrish.    After laboring in that part for a length  of time, I received a letter from Joseph  Smith and Oliver Cowdery, in which   they requested me to stay in that coun-  try and take charge of the churches   that we had built up there. The Proph-  et promised me many things, and said I   should lose no blessings by tarrying in   that country and doing as he wished me,  and letting the other brethren go and   get their endowments. I was then at  the house of Brother Abraham O.  Smoot's mother. I received this about   sundown. I went into a little room   where there was a sofa, to pray alone.  I felt full of joy and rejoicings at the   promises God had made to me through  the Prophet. While I was upon my  knees praying, my room was filled with   light. I looked and a messenger stood  by my side. I arose, and this personage   told me he had come to instruct me.   He presented before me a panorama.  He told me he wanted me to see with  my eyes and understand with my mind  what was coming to pass in the earth  before the coming of the Son of Man.   He commenced with what the revela-  tions say about the sun being turned to   darkness, the moon to blood, and the   stars falling from heaven. Those things   were all presented to me one after   another, as they will be, I suppose,  when they are manifest before the com-  ing of the Son of Man. Then he   showed me the resurrection of the  dead—what is termed the first and sec-  ond resurrection. In the first resur-  rection I saw no graves nor anyone   raised from the grave. I saw legions of   celestial beings, men and women who   had received the Gospel all clothed in  white robes. In the form they were   presented to me, they had already been  raised from the grave. After this he   showed me what is termed the second   resurrection. Vast fields of graves   were before me, and the Spirit of God  rested upon the earth like a shower of   gentle rain, and when that fell upon the  graves they were opened, and an im-  mense host of human beings came  forth. They were just as diversified in  their dress as we are here, or as they   were laid down. This person-  age taught me with regard to these   things. Among other things he showed   me, there were seven lions like burning   brass placed in the heavens. I asked  the messenger what they were for. He  said they were representative of the  different dispensations of the Gospel of   Christ to men, and they would all be   seen in the heavens among the signs   that would be shown. After this passed  by me, he disappeared. Now, if I had  been a painter I could have drawn   everything that I saw. It made an im-  pression upon me that has never left me   from that day to this. The next day   we had a meeting in the academy.   Brother Smoot and some others went  with me; but I was a lost man. I   hardly knew where I was, so enveloped   was I in that which I had seen.    I refer to this as one of the visitations   that was given me in my boyhood, so to   speak, in the Gospel. I was a Priest at   the time. Of course, there was a   motive in this personage visiting me and  teaching me these principles. He  knew a great deal better than I did  what lay before me in life. It was  doubtless sent to me for the purpose of  strengthening me and giving me en-  couragement in my labors.    The other instance I want to refer to is   what I spoke about at the recent Gen-  eral Conference. I need not dwell par-  ticularly upon this now; but I had a   motive in laying it before the people on  that occasion. The history of Brother   Kimball's operations with those evil   spirits in England is before the Church.   And while on this point I want to cor-  rect a mistake that I made in referring  to this matter at our General Confer-  ence. I got the names of Brother Kim-  ball and Brother Hyde confused in my  mind, and made it appear that Brother   Kimball rebuked those evil spirits from   Brother Hyde, when in fact it was   Brother Kimball who was afflicted with  those spirits and Brother Hyde admin-  istered to him. As this is a matter of  history, I wish to state it correctly, and  therefore make this explanation.   When Brother Kimball, Brother George  A. Smith and myself went to London,   we encountered these evil spirits. They  sought to destroy us. The very first  house that was opened to us was filled  with devils. They had gathered there  for our destruction, so that we should  not plant the Gospel in that great city  Brother Kimball went to Manchester on  some business, and left Brother George   A. Smith and myself there. One   night we sat up till 11 o'clock, talking   Mormonism, and then we went to bed.   We had only just laid down when these  spirits rested upon us, and we were in   a very fair way of losing our lives. It  was as if a strong man had me by the   throat, trying to choke me to death. In  the midst of this a spirit told me to pray.   I did so, and while praying, the door   opened, the room was filled with light,   and three messengers came in. Who   they were I know not. They came and  laid their hands upon us, and rebuked  those powers, and thereby saved our  lives. Not only so, but by the power   they held they rebuked the whole  army of devils that were in that great   city, and bound them so that they have  never troubled any Elder from that day   to this.    Now, those messengers were sent to  us because it was necessary. We would   have lost our lives if somebody had not  delivered us. We needed help, and we   could not get it anywhere else.    This is all I want to say with regard to   the administration of angels to myself.  This Apostle that I refer to told me he  had prayed and prayed for the adminis-  tration of angels. Well, if it had been   necessary to save his life, as it was in  my case, he would have had the admin-  istration of angels. But he had access  to the gift of the Holy Ghost, as all of   us have. And that, brethren and sisters,  is what I want to talk to you about.    One morning, while we were at   Winter Quarters, Brother Brigham  Young said to me and the brethren that   he had had a visitation the night previ-  ous from Joseph Smith. I asked him   what he said to him. He replied that   Joseph had told him to tell the people  to labor to obtain the Spirit of God; that  they needed that to sustain them and to   give them power to go through their   work in the earth.    Now I will give you a little of my ex-  perience in this line. Joseph Smith  visited me a great deal after his death,  and taught me many important princ-  iples. The last time he visited me was  while I was in a storm at sea. I was   going on my last mission to preside in  England. My companions were Brother  Leonard W. Hardy, Brother Milton   Holmes, Brother Dan Jones, and another  brother, and my wife and two other wo-  men. We had been traveling three  days and nights in a heavy gale, and  were being driven backwards. Finally   I asked my companions to come into   the cabin with me, and I told them to  pray that the Lord would change the  wind. I had no fears of being lost; but   I did not like the idea of being driven  back to New York, as I wanted to go  on my journey. We all offered the same   prayer, both men and women; and when  we got through we stepped on to the  deck and in less than a minute it was as  though a man had taken a sword and  cut that gale through, and you might  have thrown a muslin handkerchief out   and it would not have moved it. The   night following this Joseph and Hyrum  visited me, and the Prophet laid before  me a great many things. Among other  things, he told me to get the Spirit of  God; that all of us needed it. He also   told me what the Twelve Apostles   would be called to go through on the  earth before the coming of the Son of  Man, and what the reward of their  labors would be; but all that was taken   from me, for some reason. Neverthe-  less I know it was most glorious, al-  though much would be required at our  hands.    Joseph Smith continued visiting my-  self and others up to a certain time, and   then it stopped. The last time I saw   him was in heaven. In the night vision   I saw him at the door of the temple in  heaven. He came and spoke to me.   He said he could not stop to talk with   me because he was in a hurry. The   next man I met was Father Smith; he  could not talk with me because he was  in a hurry. I met half a dozen brethren   who had held high positions on earth,

Saviors upon Mount Zion   have been raised up, while the kingdom  is the Lord's, as the Prophet Obadiah  said they would be. This people are  doing this work now.  The Lord is with   you, and your progenitors in the spirit  world rejoice.  Let us be faithful, there-  fore, while we are here.  God has ap-  pointed us to bear this Priesthood.  Out   of the fourteen hundred millions of   people on the earth the Lord has chosen  this handful of men to bear this; to or-  dain, to organize, to warn the world, to  preach the Gospel to them.  I hope my  brethren that bear this Priesthood will   remember the value of it.  I want to   read a few more paragraphs from this   same revelation, and then I will close:    For there is a time appointed for every man,  according as his works shall be.    God shall give unto you (the Saints) knowl-  edge by his Holy Spirit, yea by the unspeak-  able gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been  revealed since the world was until now;    Which our forefathers have waited with   anxious expectation to be revealed in the last  times, which their minds were pointed to, by  the angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of   their glory:    A time to come in the which nothing shall be  withheld, whether there be one God or many   Gods, they shall be manifest;    All thrones and dominions, principalities and  powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all   who have endured valiantly for the gospel of  Jesus Christ.    And also if there be bounds set to the heavens,  or to the seas; or to the dry land, or to the sun,  moon, or stars;    All the times of their revolutions; all the   appointed days, months, and years, and all the  days of their days, months, and years, and all  their glories, laws, and set times, shall be re-  vealed, in the days of the dispensation of the  fulness of times,    According to that which was ordained in the   midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all   other Gods, before this world was, that should  be reserved unto the finishing and the end   thereof, when every man shall enter into his  eternal presence, and into his immortal rest.    There are things in that revelation that   are marvelous and wonderful.  All  thrones and dominions, principalities   and powers, shall be revealed to the   Saints of God in the own set time of the  Lord.  Today we are in this little world,   surrounded with a great many planets   that are at present unknown to us. We  scarcely know what is on this world.   We know less about Mars, or Venus, or  Jupiter, or these worlds that are neigh-  bors to us.  But here we are given to   understand that all these worlds will be  revealed.  A man's mind must become  immortal, and must stretch as wide as  eternity and be filled with the glory of  God, to ever comprehend these great   blessings which are promised unto His  people.  Therefore, let us be true and  faithful.  Do not let us lose our hold on   the Priesthood, nor upon the kingdom  of God.  Let us go in secret prayer be-  fore the Lord and call upon His holy   name.  There is where our strength lies.   I pray that God's blessings may rest up-  on all of us.  We shall all find our re-  cord in the great library of heaven; and  I hope we may so live that when we   come to meet that record we will be  satisfied with it.  I pray God to bless  President Smoot, his counselors, and   those who bear the Priesthood here, as  well as our brethren and sisters, unto   the end that we may inherit eternal life,   for Jesus' sake.  Amen.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  643    and none of them could stop to talk   with me because they were in a hurry.  I was much astonished. By and by I  saw the Prophet again, and I got the   privilege to ask him a question. "Now,"  said I, "I want to know why you are in  a hurry. I have been in a hurry all   through my life; but I expected my  hurry would be over when I got into the  kingdom of heaven, if I ever did."   Joseph said: "I will tell you, Brother   Woodruff. Every dispensation that has   had the Priesthood on the earth and   has gone into the celestial kingdom, has  had a certain amount of work to do to  prepare to go to the earth with the  Savior when He goes to reign on the   earth. Each dispensation has had  ample time to do this work. We have  not. We are the last dispensation, and   so much work has to be done, and we   need to be in a hurry in order to ac-  complish it." Of course, that was   satisfactory to me, but it was new doc-  trine to me.    Brigham Young also visited me after   his death. On one occasion he and  Brother Heber C. Kimball came in a   splendid chariot, with fine white horses,   and accompanied me to a conference  that I was going to attend. When I got   there I asked Brother Brigham if he  would take charge of the conference.  "No," said he, "I have done my work  here. I have come to see what you are  doing and what you are teaching the  people." And he told me what Joseph  Smith had taught him in Winter Quar-  ters, to teach the people to get the Spirit  of God. He said, "I want you to teach  the people to get the Spirit of God.   You cannot build up the Kingdom of   God without that."    That is what I want to say to the  brethren and sisters here today. Every   man and woman in this Church should   labor to get that Spirit. We are sur-  rounded by these evil spirits that are at  war against God and against everything   looking to the building up of the king-  dom of God; and we need this Holy   Spirit to enable us to overcome these  influences. I have had the Holy Ghost  in my travels. Every man has that has   gone out into the vineyard and labored   faithfully for the cause of God. I have  referred to the administration of angels  to myself. What did these angels do?   One of them taught me some things re-  lating to the signs that should precede  the coming of the Son of Man. Others   came and saved my life. What then?  They turned and left me. But how is it  with the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost   does not leave me if I do my duty. It   does not leave any man who does his   duty. We have known this all the way  through. Joseph Smith told Brother  John Taylor on one occasion to labor to  get the Spirit of God, and to follow its  dictation, and it would become a prin-  ciple of revelation within him. God has  blessed me with that, and everything I   have done since I have been in this   Church has been done upon that prin-  ciple. The Spirit of God has told me   what to do, and I have had to follow   that.    In the time of the apostasy in Kirt-  land, Joseph Smith hardly knew when   he met a man, unless the Spirit of God   revealed it to him, whether he was friend   or foe. Most of the leading men were   fighting him. Right in the midst of that   darkness the Spirit of God said to me,  "You choose a partner and go straight  to Fox Islands." Well, I knew no more   what was on Fox Islands than what was   on Kolob. But the Lord told me to go,  and I went. I chose Jonathan H. Hale,   and he went with me. We cast out some  devils there, preached the Gospel and   performed some miracles. I crossed  lake Ontario and went into Connecticut,  where my father lived. I had not seen   one of my relatives from the time I em-  braced the Gospel. I preached the Gos-  pel there, and baptized my father, my  stepmother, and sister, and uncles and  aunts, and organized a branch there.   Every member of that branch was a   relative of mine, excepting one, and he  was a Methodist class leader who board-  ed at my father's house. This was all   promised to me by old father Smith   when he blessed me. I got to Fox Is-  lands, and did a good work there.   Through the blessings of God I brought  nearly a hundred from there up to Zion,  at the time the Saints were driven out of  Missouri into Illinois.    So it has been all through my life. If   I have undertaken to do anything, and  the Lord has wanted me to do some-  thing else, He has had to tell me. When  we were sent to England, we were sent  by revelation. I went into the Stafford-  shire potteries with Brother Alfred Cor-  don. We were doing a splendid work,  baptizing almost every night, and I  thought it was the finest mission I ever   was on. I went into the town of Hanley   one night, and attended meeting in a   large hall, which was filled to overflow-  ing. The Spirit of the Lord came upon  me and said that that was the last meet-  ing I should hold with that people for   many days. I told the people that that   was the last meeting I should be with   them. After the meeting, they asked  me where I was going. I told them I   did not know. In the morning I asked  the Lord what He wanted of me. He   merely said, "Go to the south." I got  into the stage and rode eighty miles[.]  The first man's house I stopped at was  John Benbow's in Herefordshire. In   half an hour after I entered the house I  knew exactly why the Lord had sent   me. There was a people there who   had been praying for the ancient order   of things. They were waiting for the  Gospel as it was taught by Christ and  His Apostles. The consequence was,   the first thirty days after I got there I   baptized six hundred of those people.  In eight month's labor in that country I  brought eighteen hundred into the  Church. Why? Because there was a  people prepared for the Gospel, and the  Lord sent me there to do that work. I   have always had to give God the glory   for everything good that has happened  to me; for I have realized by what  power it came.    When I got back to Winter Quarters   from the pioneer journey, President   Young said to me, "Brother Woodruff,  I want you to take your wife and chil-  dren and go to Boston, and stay there   until you can gather every Saint of God  in New England and Canada and send   them up to Zion." I did as he told me.   It took me two years to gather up every-  body, and I brought up the rear with a   company. When I got into Pittsburg   with this company it was dusk, and I saw  a steamer just preparing to go out. I   walked right up to the captain and asked  him if he was ready to go out. He said  he was. "How many passengers have  you?" "Two hundred and fifty." "Can   you take another hundred?" "I can."  "Then," said I, "I would like to go   aboard with you." The words were   hardly out of my mouth when the Holy  Ghost said to me, "Don't you, nor   your company go aboard that steamer."  That was enough; I had learned the   voice of the Spirit. I turned and told  the captain that I had made up my mind   not to go at present. That steamer  started out. It was a dark night, and  before the steamer had gone far she  took fire, and all on board was lost. We  should probably have shared the same  fate, had it not been for that monitor  within me.    I refer to these things because I want   you to get the same Spirit. All the   Elders of Israel, whether abroad or at   home, need that Spirit. When I was on  my way east at one time I drove into a   man's yard in Indiana. Brother Orson   Hyde had driven in and set his wagon in  the dooryard, and I set mine by the side  of it. I turned my mules and tied them   up to an oak tree. I had my wife and   two children with me in my carriage.   We went to lie down, and the Holy   Spirit told me to get up and move my   carriage. I got right up. My wife   asked me what I was going to do. I   said I was going to move the carriage.  She wanted to know what for. I told  her I did not know. I moved the   carriage about fifteen rods, looked   around, and then went to bed again.   The Spirit told me to get up again and  move my mules. I did so. In twenty   minutes there came up a whirlwind that   blew that oak tree down and laid it  right across where my carriage had   been. By listening to that Spirit our   lives were saved.    Now, it was not an angel that pointed   out these things to me; it was the Holy   Ghost. This is the Spirit that we must   have to carry out the purposes of God  on the earth. We need that more than  any other gift. I felt impressed yester-  day to teach this principle to the Latter-  day Saints. We are in the midst of   enemies, in the midst of darkness and  temptation, and we need to be guided  by the Spirit of God. We should pray   to the Lord until we get the Comforter.   This is what is promised to us when we  are baptized. It is the spirit of light, of   truth, and of revelation, and can be with  all of us at the same time.    Brethren and sisters, God bless you.   I am glad to meet with you. There are  very few of you as old as I am. How  long I shall tarry in this country I do  not know; but while I do stay I want to  do what good I can. These are prin-  ciples that have rested a great deal upon  my mind. If we labor for this Spirit,  we will have no quarreling, and no dif-  ficulty, so long as that is dwelling with-  in us. God bless you. Amen. 
 Let us do our duty; let us cease setting  our hearts upon the fashions and things of  this world, and laboring to enrich ourselves  at the sacrifice of the kingdom of God.   We have a co-operative mercantile institu-  tion; and it is the duty of these Latter-  day Saints to sustain and uphold it; and   so with everything else that is in the  kingdom, for these are the stepping stones  to us to a fullness of the celestial king-  dom of God.    I thank God that I live in this day and  age of the world, when my ears have heard  the sound of the fullness of the gospel of  Christ. I thank God that I have seen the  face of prophets, apostles, and inspired   men. I rejoice in this, and I pray God my  heavenly Father that I, and my brethren  and sisters, may have power to unite and   take hold and build up this kingdom.   When we do this it will not be in the pow-  er of earth or hell to take away our rights   and privileges; for I tell you that if this   people were united according to the law of  God, wherein we should become fully jus-  tified before the Lord, sinners in Zion would   tremble and fearfulness would sur-  prise the hypocrite; the power of God  would rest upon Zion, the angels of God  would visit the earth, the judgments of   God would be poured upon the wicked,  the Zion of God would be redeemed, the  temples of God would be reared, the   prison doors would be opened and the  prisoners in the spirit world would go free,   because we would feel the spirit and  power of our mission and calling and  should fulfill it.    I pray that God will bless this people  and that he will bless President Young  who has already outlived four of his coun-  selors. The Lord says—"I will take whom  I will take, and I will preserve whom I   will preserve." All these counselors were  younger men than President Young, yet  he has outlived them. God has ordained   President Young to live, and he has lived  so long, and has had the prayers of hun-  dreds and thousands of Saints, which   have entered into the ears of the Lord of  Sabaoth for his preservation; and the Lord  has heard and answered these prayers.    Let us, as Elders of Israel, rise up and  bear off this kingdom. Let us forsake  our evils and wickedness, and repent of   our sins, and renew our covenants and   keep the commandments of God; that we  may lighten the burdens of our President,  that his spirit may be cheered, and that  the power of God may attend him in his   labors for the advancement of Zion upon  the earth.    This is my prayer in the name of Jesus,   Amen.
