 Now we will endeavour to show forth the effects manifested by the Holy Ghost anciently, and the bless-ings which flowed from it. Let us turn to Cor. xii.— The Apostle Paul tells us that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now, there are diversities of gifts, or blessings—namely, wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discern-ing of spirits, diverse kind of tongues, interpretation oftongues, dreams, visions, &c., &c.; which were all manifested in the Body or Church of Christ; in which were set, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, &c., which were given for the perfecting ofthe Saints, and the work of the ministry, for the edi-fying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in theunity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son ofGod, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.—Eph. iv.Having presented before the public, in these pages, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it was anciently taughtby Christ and his apostles, which consisted of faith, re-pentance, baptism for the remission of sins, the gift ofthe Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and the gifts,graces, and blessings, which were for the work of theministry, and the edifying of the body of Christ; andwhich were to continue until that which is perfect should come; we also wish to say, that as God is an un-changeable Being, we firmly believe that the same Gos-pel and plan of salvation, Holy Ghost, gifts, and graces, are equally necessary for the salvation of men, the edi-fying of the body, and the work of the ministry, in thisgeneration, as they were eighteen hundred years ago;as the Gospel was committed to the Gentiles for the express purpose of preparing them for the second com-ing of Christ—which coming is nigh at hand; this is evident, from the signs of the times.That the people in this city may be without excusein the great and coming day of the Lord; and in order that our garments may be clear of their blood, we feel unwilling to close our subject until we bear testimony, by laying before them, that the Lord has set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which are of the house of Israel, and with themthe fulness of the Gentiles. And hath also sent a holyangel, who hath committed the everlasting Gospel, and restored the priesthood, and sent forth his servants to cry repentance, and baptism for the remission of sins,and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and to prune his vineyard

 510  THE DESERET WEEKLY.vail they would find their recordsthere, in the great library of the King-dom of Heaven, and he would like to have a good account, as he wanted all of them to have.After pointing out the important responsibility resting upon the people of God, and remarking that the eyes of the Lord and all the heavenly hostwere constantly upon them, President Woodruff said that God had greatly blessed them thus far in their missionhere below and would yet give them the power to accomplish much more,if they but walked uprightly before Him, lived in unity, and carried out the purposes and principles of the Gospel in their daily life. Whatever duties we were called upon to perform,we should fulfil them cheerfully. To-day the Latter-day Saints who dwelt in the valleys of these mountains oc-cupied a very important position in the world. A great change was taking place in public opinion toward them, even in our own nation. They had been so derided and misrepresented in the past that people at one time, it would seem, hardly dared to come into Salt Lake City for fear that they would have their throats cut or be otherwisekilled! The object of this people wasto labor for the welfare of their fellow-men both here and abroad; and this was what they had been doing all theway through. The gospel which they preached would save all the sons of men under theheaven who would embrace it and obey all its laws. The Latter-day Saintswere not the enemies of anybody. They believed that every man had a right to his religion, to whatever sect he might belong, and this people only claimed in return the same privilege. That was all they ever had asked.The speaker referred briefly to the building of temples by the Latter-day Saints, and said they had made thisonce desert land to bring forth things in abundance for the sustenance of man, through the power of God. Thousands had gone before us here and thousands would come after; but the foundation had been laid and we were building upon it.In conclusion, President Woodruff alluded to the ceremony of placing thecap-stone on the Temple on Wednes-day. A great deal had been said as to people going upon the building on that occasion, but he wished to state that not one-tenth of that congregation could go up there. It was de-sired that all should remain onterra firma except the very few whose duty it would be to ascend the building to perform the necessary work of the day. He would rather not a soul went up than that one man, womanor child should be injured.

 with a mighty pruning, for the last time—in order to establish permanent peace upon earth, for one thousand years, during which time Christ will reign upon earth with his Saints, according to the testimony of John.The everlasting Gospel must go forth to the nations of the earth, to seal up the righteous, and to prepare them for the hour of judgment and dissolution that await the inhabitants of the earth: because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, and broken the ever-lasting covenant.—See Is. xxiv. 5.O ye inhabitants of this great city! we call upon you in the name of Jesus Christ, to repent of your sins and wickedness, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and be baptized in water for the remis-sion of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; and be prepared to escape the judgmentsof God, which speedily await the world, and will comeupon this generation like a whirlwind, and overtake themas a thief in the night—according to the testimony ofthe angel of God, who hath flown through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him, for the hour of his judgment is to come.—Rev. xiv. 6.HEBER C. KIMBALLWILFORD WOODRUFF.We are well aware that many persons feel disposed to condemn us,and to calumniate our characters, by styling us false prophets, and false teachers, without even taking the trouble to inquire into the truth of our mission, or concerning the doctrines which we preach; we would, therefore, call upon all those who are sincere searchers after truth, to act according to the apostle's advice—"Prove all things—hold fast that which is good." Solomon says, "He that judgeth a matter before he heareth it, is not wise." And the Saviour says, "With what judgment we judge, we shall also be judged—and with what measure we mete, it shall be measured to us again."Any person desiring farther information respecting our doctrines,may obtain our publications at 40, Ironmonger Row, St. Luke's, London. We would also inform the public, that we preach on theSabbath, at Mr. Barratt's Academy, 57, King Square, Goswell Road;entrance in President Street. Hours—Half-past Two; Half-pastSix. Also on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, at Seven o'clock.

 President Wilford Woodruff said: I feel disposed to occupy a fewmoments in bearing testimony to the principles presented unto us by Elder Penrose. He has referred to the freedom of the soul, to the freedomof the mind of the Latter-day Saints toward other people. I traveled with Joseph Smith thousands of miles; have been associated with him and with the Apostles of our Church almost since its organization. I haveheard Joseph Smith say in public and in private that if he were the emperor of the world, and had control of every human being on the face of the earth, he would give every man, woman and child the fullest liberty to enjoy their religion, and sustain them in it, let that religion be what itmight. Those are my sentiments. We have no contention with any man on earth because of his religion. Joseph Smith's argument upon this sub-ject was this: There is no emperor, no monarch, no king, no presidentbreathing the breath of life on earth who has created his subjects. Theyare the creatures of God; He created them; they are His children.  Therefore, neither emperor, president, king nor ruler has the right to deprive any of his subjects of the right of worshiping God according to their consciences, for they are held responsible and accountable to their Creator for their religion, and not to man.If I had the control of fifty tabernacles, and any preachers of theGospel, from any sect under heaven, who had not tabernacles or temples of their own to go into to give their views, I would be perfectly willing they should occupy them. If there is a sect or a man on the face of the earth who has got a truth I do not possess, I want it. Why? Because I am going into the spirit world, the same as you are. The men whom I was acquainted with in early days in this Church have almost all passed away, and I shall follow them very soon myself. This whole congregation,with all the Christian world, have to pass, in a few years, to the other side of the veil. Then deception will not answer nor be of any benefit to me. Any false testimony I may give, or anything I may do subversive of the will of God towards His creature, man, I shall be held accountable for before the bar of Almighty God, and so will every other man. Therefore, while we accord to every man the right to enjoy his own religion, to be-lieve what he pleases and worship as he sees fit, we claim, as Latter-day Saints, the same privilege. This is a fundamental doctrine of our faith.  What Brother Penrose has said here to-day is true.

 REMARKSMade at the Salt Lake Stake Conference, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday Afternoon, September 2nd, 1894 byPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-The angel Moroni said to the Prophet Joseph Smith, "Whatsoever enticethand leadeth to good and to dogood is of God, and whatsoever dothnot is of that wicked one." That is a true principle. I wish to make some remarks upon this, but before doing so I desire to refer to our meet-ing this forenoon. There was prob-ably not one half present this morning of those who are here this afternoon, and therefore many may not fullyunderstand what I allude to.  This is a Stake Conference, and there was a report made this morning of the fast offerings received from the variouswards in the Stake and the amounts disbursed for the support of the poor. I think that the report showed that during the last six months this Stakealone received from the general tithingoffice $14,000 for the support of the poor. I believe I am sa e in saying that fifty per cent of all the tithing collected throughout the mountains of Israel is returned to the various Stakes for local expenses, among which is the support of the poor. I think myself that this is wrong. As Latter-day Saints, we should observe our fast meetings and our fast offerings. Weshould at least make a donation of that which we save by fasting, and give it to the Bishop for the support of the poor. It was remarked this morning that some people said they could not fast because it made their head ache. Well, I canfast, and so can any other man; and ifit makes my head ache by keeping the commandments of God, let it ache. Ifwe did our duty with regard to thepoor among us the tithing would not be withheld from the Presiding Bishop-ric for the support of the poor. In this,brethren and sisters, I certainly think we should improve. There is nothing gained by our attempting to shirk any duty that God requires of us. We should be more diligent in attending our fast meetings. We should fast asthe Lord requires. The Lord does notask anything of any man that he can-not perform. Whenever the Lord gives a commandment to the children of men, He provides a way for the fulfilment of that commandment.  Tithing is a commandment of God to the people, and should be observed. The report of what the Relief Society has done is certainly a great credit to them.  The amount of means whichthey have donated for the support of the poor in this Stake is a large amount,considering the labors that there are upon that Society. I hope we will all reflect upon these things and not forgetour duty with regard to the fast offer-ings and the fast meetings, as well as all other meetings that we are required to attend.President Angus M. Cannon referred to the officers of the Stake not being present at this Conference. I think if we all felt as we should, if we under-stood the signs of the times, we would take pleasure in attending meetings as far as possible. The Presidency of the Church and the Twelve Apostles have the conferences of the whole Church to attend, and when they are not here they are performing other duties.Now, with regard to the statement I made in the beginning, "Whatsoeverenticeth and leadeth to good and to do good is of God, and whatsoever doth not is of that wicked one." While we as a people accord to every denomina-tion the right to enjoy their religion, we claim the same privilege ourselves. I have often referred to this, becauseperhaps it has appeared sometimes asthough we were encroaching upon others. This, however, is not the case. Let us compare the good with the eviltoday. Where is there a man, no mat-ter what sect he belongs to, who cannot see a great change in the world today? I remember very well over eighty years of my life, and I certainly have never seen such a time in my life in theUnited States as I have during the lastyear. The spirit of murder, of whore-dom, of blasphemy that is going like a flood over the land, and the increase of crime on every hand, is certainly alarm-ing. Is it from God? Does it lead to good? It does not. There is no God in it. When we look at these things we can see that there is a power manifest in our land and among the nations ofthe earth that is leading men to do evil. There is one thing very promi-nently before my mind, and that is the unpopularity of God himself, and of Jesus Christ, and of the Gospel of the Son of God. In the days of the Savior there were a good many religious sects,and they were all at war with the Savior and His Apostles. They fought against everything they did, and labored for their destruction until the Savior and His Apostles were put to death.  Were they led by the Spirit of God? They were not. They were not inspired to do right; they were seeking to do wrong. In this dispensation the Proph-et Joseph was an unpopular man. He was opposed by the world, and by agreat many men who professed to be ministers of the Gospel. They laboredagainst him and to overthrow his doctrines. Now, if Joseph Smith was right, his persecutors were not right. Of course, every man must be his ownjudge with regard to that. If JesusChrist and the Apostles were right, then those men who fought againstthem were not right.We are informed by the revelation of St. John that in the last days there would be something like six hundred three score and six different religionssects and parties in the earth.  Of course, there could be but oneof them right; for there is but one right way. There is but one Gospel; there never was but one and never will be. That Gospel never deviates from one generation to another. So with the Holy Priesthood. The Priesthood is the same in every generation. When-ever God has had a people on the faceof the earth, He has had the Priest-hood among them. In fact, no man has the right to administer in one of the ordinances of the Gospel of the Son of God only by and through the power of the Holy Priesthood. Theancient apostles and prophets who ad-ministered in the ordinances of the Gospel held that Priesthood.  With-out that authority they would have hadno right to administer in these ordin-ances. So in this day, this principle is the same.Now, my friends, it does not pay any man to preach false doctrine or otpractice false principles, because there is no salvation in it. It is for salvation that we labor. For that the Lord called Joseph Smith to organize theChurch of Jesus Christ once more for the last time on the earth, so that abody of people would be prepared for the coming of the Son of Man. TheGospel of Christ was with JosephSmith. The Priesthood was given toJoseph Smith by those who held that Priesthood in the days of Jesus. He never pretended to administer in one ordinance until he received the com-mandment of God to do it. Those of you who have embraced the Gos-pel and have lived your religion knowfor yourselves that the power of God has followed this work from the com-mencement until today. I know it has, and I know it will if we do our duty.  All the ancient patriarchs and prophetslabored for salvation, for the glory where God and Christ dwell, thatafter death, in their immortal bodies,they might occupy that position forever.  It paid them to do it, and it will payall men to do the same. We cannot spend our time foolishly in safety. Wehave a mission to fulfil.  Some portion of the Holy Priesthood has been givento almost every man in the land of

Jan. 9th 1895 you wrote me thatthe missionary committee said that I couldhave a year or more if necessary to preparefor my suggested mission, and that whenI was ready to report to President Woodruff,ant any time after Jan. 1st 1896 I will beready to go on my mission either to theSouthern States or Great Britan it makesno difference to me, tell the committee to use 
 Zion, and to many of them at a veryearly age. It has been given to us that we may administer in the ordin-ances of the Gospel and in the things of the kingdom of God. Then let ustry to magnify our callings and to doour duty. We know the principles we are practicing are true.  The Lord has given us power to rear these temples unto His holy name, that we may enter in as saviors on mountZion and redeem our dead, that theywho have never heard the Gospel may partake of eternal life. Jesushimself went to preach to the spiritsin prison, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh. So do the apostles and elders of Israel as they pass away. We labor this side of the veil, and they labor the other side of the veil. These things are true. God has established this Church. He hasraised up prophets and apostles, and has planted a work in these mountains of Israel, where this congregation have been gathered by the power of God.  We have a labor to perform, and if we do not do it we will be under con-demnation. I know this is the work of God. I know the Priesthood ishere, and I know the power of God has followed this Priesthood since the Church was organized. Our Elders have traveled at home and abroad.  They have been taken from the various occupations of life and thrust into the vineyard. They have traveled thou-sands of miles, and that, too, without purse and scrip, preaching withoutprice. I never thought of taking any money with me on my missions. I have traveled in a good many coun-tries, and I always traveled without purse and scrip, and I preached with-out money and without price.  The Lord always raised up friends for me in time of need. I was fed and clothed and had all the necessaries of life. That is the way the ancient Apostles preached. It was the way the Eldersof Israel have had to preach in the day and generation in which we live.Brethren and Sisters, I hope we willlook at the position we occupy hereand the work that lies before us, and as far as we can go into these temples. Ithank God we have a temple upon thisblock, where the Latter-day Saints inthis region can enter and redeem their dead—their fathers and mothers and their progenitors who have gone into the spirit world without the Gos-pel. They never heard the Gospel, and no man, in time or in eternity, willever be saved in the celestial kingdom of God without the Gospel of Christ. Therefore, let us look upon these things as they are. Let us try to live ourreligion, that when we get through we may be satisfied with life. I prayedmany an hour when a boy that theLord would let me live to see a prophet or an apostle, or some man who could teach me that Gospel which I read of in the New Testament. I have lived to see that day, and I thank God for it. I have tried to do what good I could in my weak way. I have tried to go into these temples and redeem my father's house. With the assistance of my friends I have been able to do this. When I go to the other side of the veil and meet with them, I think I shall besatisfied, and I think they will. They will find that these principles are true, and so will all denominations when theycome in the presence of God. Theywill learn then, if not before, that thisis the work of God. I pray God to bless all who are connected with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. May we magnify our calling and do our duty, that when we get through and go into the presence of God and read our history in that great library in heaven, where the acts of all men are recorded, we may be satisfied.  God give us wisdom, and lead and guide us in our duty, that we may over-come the world, the flesh and the devil, and inherit eternal life, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

 The Latter-day Saints are somewhat peculiar from other religiousdenominations; one of their peculiarities is this, that no man knows when he comes into this Tabernacle who is going to speak here. This is true, as a general thing. This is my personal experience. I have traveled onehundred and sixty thousand miles in the last sixty years of my life. I have been in the Church about that length of time. I have traveled among the nations of the earth, the islands of the sea and in my own country. I have preached the Gospel, and I have never known, wheneverI arose to speak to the people, what I was going to say. I have been de-pendent upon the inspiration of Almighty God, as have all the Elders in this Church. Brother Penrose has remarked concerning our manner ofpreaching. Whom has the Lord called, from the creation of the world, to do this work? He has called, in a great measure, the weak things of this world. You may trace this in the whole history of the dealings of God with men. When He wanted a king in Israel, He chose a boy—David, oneof the sons of Jesse. [##1 Samuel 16:1-13##] Who were the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ,whom He chose to stand by Him and to preach the Gospel? They wereilliterate fishermen. [##Matthew 4:18-22##] Men in this day have been called from the plow, theplane and the hammer, and the various occupations of life, and thrust into the vineyard of the Lord. Why have they gone? Because they knew forthemselves—every man has known who has embraced this Gospel and done his duty—that he has had to depend upon the Lord. That is the only dependence that we have. I never in my life, except in one or two instances in my early preaching, attempted to prepare anything to say to the congregation, and when I did I never touched the subject at all.I will say to our friends who are present, you see a city here, you see atabernacle here. How did this come about? I came here with President Young, in 1847. We found a barren desert—as barren as the desert of Sahara. It was in keeping with the name it bore—the Great American Desert. How is it to-day? There is a city here, and we are building a Temple. We go into temples to attend to ordinances for the living andthe dead, as has been told us to-day? These Elders of Israel have beencalled by the power of God to go forth into the world and preach to their fellowmen, and they have promised them in the name of Jesus Christ that all who received this Gospel should receive the Holy Ghost. If this werenot true, and the men and women they baptized received not the Holy Ghost, could they not have found it out before this time? Had not the Lord Almighty backed up this testimony of His humble servants, Utah to-day would be as barren as we found it in 1847, so far as the Latter-day Saints are concerned. But by the power of God men have received this,and by His power they have been gathered here.I will say another thing. The prophecies of Isaiah would have fallenunfulfilled, as well as the prophecies of many other Prophets, had not these things taken place. Since the creation of man the Lord has never brought judgment upon any generation, upon any city, town or country, that I have ever read of, whenever they have been ripened in iniquity, until He has fully warned them by men raised up for that purpose, andthey have rejected those men. Take those ancient cities, when they be-

 came ripened in iniquity, the Lord raised up humble, honest men to warnkings, rulers, and those that inhabited those cities, that the judgments of God would overtake them if they did not repent. Read the history ofThebes, of Tyre, of Sidon, of Nineveh, of Memphis, and of Babylon the great, built to defy all power but God Himself. All that the Prophetsprophesied unto them came to pass to the very letter. There is not a Christian, a Jew, a "Mormon," or an infidel, or any body else, can pointto a prophecy or a revelation contained in the Bible by any man of God sent to any of these cities but what has had its fulfillment. Babylon itselfwas overthrown, and, in fact, it has been so covered by the drifting sands of the desert that man can hardly find its foundations to-day.I wish to say to the Church and to the gentlemen and ladies who visit us, that we believe we are living in one of the most important genera-tions God ever gave to man. Read the revelations of St. John. Read the revelations of Isaiah and the other Prophets. Are they going to fall un-fulfilled? I tell you nay! they will come to pass. I will say as one man who has lived a considerable length of time, as men count time, that the great change I see taking place in the world has an effect upon my mind, because in it I see the fulfillment of these revelations of God. I lived in Farmington, Connecticut. I received my first teachings under Dr. Porter,and under Dr. Haws, of Hartford. They were two reverend gentlemen, learned men, and they taught according to the light and knowledge of their day and generation. I used to have peculiar feelings, and I wouldask these gentlemen questions. Said I, "Why is it that you don't contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints? How is it that you don't havethose gifts and graces tbat were manifest in the days of Christ and His Apostles?" They told me that these things were given in the dark ages ofthe world, to convince the children of men that Jesus was the Christ. Butsaid they, we are now living in the blaze of the great Gospel light, and we don't need them. Now, I did not believe that then; I don't believe it now. That kind of argument I could not comprehend. I agree with Brother Penrose that whenever the Lord has a Church upon the earth, and that Church receives the Gospel of Christ, and they enjoy the HolyGhost, every gift and grace that ever did belong to the Church of God be-longs to that Church, no matter who they are nor in what age of the worldthey live. These things are true to day, and have been manifest since theorganization of this Church.We have been called and commanded of God to preach the Gospel ofChrist, or be under condemnation. The Gospel of Christ does not injure anybody. But there is one strange thing with regard to the inhabitants of the earth and the Church of Christ. The Apostles, Prophets and lead-ing men in every age of the world, if they tried to live godly in ChristJesus, became unpopular. Even Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who came to redeem the world, follow him from the manger to the cross, through suffering mingled with blood, to the throne of grace, and was he popular? No, He was not. Were the Apostles popular? They were not. The Jews and Gentiles not only crucified the Savior, but put to death every Apostle and every man that bore the Priesthood in that day and time, excepting

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  497GENERAL CONFERENCEThe conference was addressed by President Wilford Woodruff as follows: I want to say to my friends this morning that I am a very happy man. My heart is filled with gratitude to God my Heavenly Father for the blessings I enjoy. It is over seven years since the Presidency of this Church and as many of the Twelve Apostles have occupied this stand until today, and I feel that we have all reason to thank God and re-joice in His name for the blessings and privileges that we enjoy this glorious morning. Turning to Apostle Snow the speaker asked: Is there any law against a man telling what is in his heart if he has no evil in it?Apostle Snow replied that he knew of none.President Woodruff -- Brother Snow says that he does not know of any such law, and therefore I say God bless Presi-dent Harrison for exercising his official clemency in liberating President Joseph F. Smith, and I am thankful that Brother Smith is with us today. I say also God bless every other man, whether he be Jew or Gentile, Catho-lic or Protestant, judge or juryman, who has lent his name to this and not only liberated President Smith but many of our brethren who have the privilege of sitting here with us on this occasion. I hope there is no harm in that thought or feeling; for that is the way I do feel at this time. My heart is full of grati-tude and blessing to my fellowmen for all the good they have done. Every-thing that leads to good and to do good is of God; and everything that leads to evil and to do evil is said to be of the wicked one. I feel that all of us have reason to rejoice be-fore the Lord for the deliverance and blessings which He has wrought among us. I rejoice in the union which exists among us as a Presidency of this Church and the twelve apostles. These are bodies of men who of all men under heaven should be united in the work of the Lord in which we are engaged. I do not believe there ever has been a body of men in any age of the world who, as a general thing, are more united and happy than are these today; and while we are here assembled together I hope and trust that we may have the inspira-tion of Almighty God with us in our teachings, in our instructions, in our counsels. We shall call upon our brothers to address us, and I say in the name of the Lord, let us all have peace. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFspoke as follows: I realize it is somewhat late, but I want to beg theindulgence of this assembly a few moments. I felt that as I was a mem-ber of these Mutual Improvement Associations I wanted to attend thismeeting and hear this lecture. I did not wish to interfere with the timeof Brother Roberts. He has given us an excellent discourse, and has toldus the truth. There are a few things pertaining to this subject on whichI wish to bear my testimony to the young men of Israel.First, I wish to say a few words regarding Priesthood. There is no mis-take about the Priesthood of God Almighty. The God of heaven Himselfhas created and redeemed this world by the power of that Priesthood;and no being that ever dwelt on this earth ever has or ever will be ableto do or perform any work pertaining to salvation unless it is by thateternal and everlasting Priesthood. And where that Priesthood of Al-mighty God is manifest, the power of that Priesthood is with the people,no matter what age or generation they have lived in. And I wish tosay that there has been no generation, no dispensation, any greater thanthe one in which Joseph Smith was raised up. He laid the foundation ofthis great work under God, and He established the Church upon the faceof the whole earth, in fulfilment of revelation and prophecy from FatherAdam down to our day; and the Lord has made, and will make no mis-take in regard to calling a people or giving them the Priesthood.As I have said, Joseph Smith organized the Church. He lived but ashort time with us—a little longer than the Savior did after He entered the ministry. The Savior lived about three and a half years from the 
 172 THE DESERET NEWS April 12ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFFRecited several instances of the power of faith, recorded in the Bible, and said also by that same power Joseph Smith had been enabled to accomplish all that he did in lay-ing the foundation of the great latter-day kingdom. By faith the apostles had been able to travel without purse or scrip tens of thousands of miles to preach the Gospel. By faith President B. Young led this people into the wilderness, where the savage was accustomed to roam. By faith, in-dustry, and the blessing of God this barren, desert land had been turned into a fruitful field. Without the power of God accompanying the efforts of the Elders, this Terri-tory would never have been peo-pled by those we now saw here. Every one who received the Gos-pel was under obligation to bear testimony to the truth. The pro-phecies of the Bible could not have been fulfilled, if an angel had not come to the earth, and brought the Gospel to the children of men. Why did God choose that untutor-ed boy, Joseph Smith, to be en-trusted with the keys of salvation? Why did he not choose one of the popular preachers of the day? Sim-ply because God could not use them, for they would sell the king-dom for popularity, hence he chose a poor boy, and led him by revela-tion day by day, until he had com-pleted the work he was raised up to doHe then spoke of those who had never heard the fulness of the ever-lasting gospel, and the necessity for temples to be erected, so that the ordinances of the gospel might be performed for these in the spirit world. He addressed a few encou-raging words to the young men, also to the members of the relief societies. 
 ELDER W. WOODRUFFSpoke of the greatness of the workin which we, as Elders in Isreal,were engaged. Those who weretaking a part in carrying forwardthe kingdom of God, were ordainedbefore the creation of the world to accomplish this work. There neverwas a time when the Saints were so much united in carrying out the purposes of God as now. We should go to work of salvation for our deadmight go on. It took jush as much to save a dead man, as a living one.The judgments of God awaited the wicked, all heaven was watch-ing our movements. They were not perfect without us nor we with-out them. It was the kingdom of God or nothing. If this kingdom did not prosper, neither did we.We all had a right to the gifts of the gospel. Zion would prevail,Zion would arise and put on her beautiful garments. No one needhave any fears about this kingdom;every revelation pertaining to its building up would fulfilled tothe very letter. We had every-thing to encourage us. We shouldpay our tithing and offerings and attend to every known duty and God would be with us henceforthand for ever.ELDER W. WOODRUFFgave an interesting account of the labors performed in the St. George Temple from the time of its dedica-tion until he left.He said he would rejoice exceed-ingly to see the time when the Tem-ple in this city and Logan wouldbe completed, so that the saints inthis section of country might havean opportunity of attending totheir baptisms, ordinations forthemselves and their dead, with-out the necessity of traveling sogreat a distance as they now hadto do, to St. George. The work inthe Temple there would be resum-ed on the 20th of this month. 
 President Wilford Woodruff said:Before this Conference closes there isa subject I wish to say a few wordsupon. Brother Cannon has to-daylaid before us the truth with regardto the ordinances of the Holy Gospel,the revelations of Jesus Christ andthe principles pertaining to the salva-tion of this people, which are revealedto us in the Bible, Book of Mormon,Doctrine and Covenants, and are giventhrough the living oracles. Paulsays there is but one Gospel, and"Though we or an angel from heavenpreach any other Gospel than thatwhich I have preached unto you, lethim be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8-9##] Whenever therehas been any baptism from the daysof Father Adam, or Moses, when hecrossed the Red Sea, down to the daysof Jesus Christ, and Joseph Smith,it has always been the same. Therehas never been any change in theGospel ordinances, in baptism orrepentance; no change in the princi-ples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.There has never been any change inthe manner of receiving them; nochange in the reception of the HolyGhost. It is so in every age andgeneration of the world. There is nochange in the holy resurrection of thechildren of men from the grave.These principles have all been reservedfor us. I wish to say that in myacquaintance in this Church, I haveseen men, from time to time rise upand try to be servants of God. Theytry to explain things they knownothing about, to make themselvesappear clever. There is a great dealof this kind of thing in this age.There was one of the leading Eldersof the Church who went before thepeople and undertook to preach cer-tain principles. Joseph heard of itand desired him to present the doc-trine to him in writing. He wrote it,and when he completed it read it tothe Prophet. He asked Joseph whathe thought of it. "Why," said Joseph,"it is a beautiful system, I have butone fault to find with it—" What isthat, Brother Joseph?" Joseph said—"It is not true." So I say, every littlewhile someone, thinking he is smart,tries to teach something that is not inthe Doctrine and Covenants andChurch works, and which is not true.I, myself, sat for over two hoursonce in a meeting-house, in St Louis,listening to a prominent Elder of thisChurch, who had called the people to-gether to preach to them the doctrineof the, what was called, "baby resur-rection." He preached to two or threethousand people, and there was not aword of truth in the doctrine. Ithought he ought to know better. Inthe afternoon I was called upon tospeak. After meeting there were agreat many people gathered roundme and asked what I thought of theman's sermon. I replied, it is allnonsense. Well, that is just how Ifelt. It is no benefit in this worldfor men to preach such false doctrine.And now, every little while, I hear ofsome one of the Elders, who wishesto be considered smart, trying toteach something they know nothingabout.The Elders have a world of truthto preach about. There is enoughrevealed to fill the whole earth as longas you live. Preach the truth as youunderstand it. Do not speculate onthings you know nothing about, for itwill benefit no one. If you listen tofalse doctrine you will be led away byfalse spirits. Remember and observethis, and you will be all right. Keepin the paths of truth, and all will bewell with you.I pray God to bless you, my breth-ren and sisters. We have had a goodtime during this Conference. Wehave had many testimonies, and theyare true. Let us lay them to heart,and be not discouraged. Rely uponthe Lord and you will be all right.Salvation is here; the kingdom ofGod is here, the Gospel is here; theZion of God is here; the work ofGod is upon the earth. It is beingbuilt up and established. Let us doour duty, trusting in God, and we willbe brought off triumphant. And whenwe get through we will be satisfiedwith our labors in the flesh, and theLord's dealings with us. I hope wewill so conduct ourselves and carry outthe principles of salvation, that wemay gain eternal life, which may Godgrant, in the name of Jesus Christ.Amen. 
 John the Revelator. So in all ages they have been unpopular. So was Joseph Smith. He laid down his life for the word of God and testimonyof Jesus Christ. He has gone into the spirit world, and he will receive hisreward there. He was a Prophet of God. He laid the foundation of a great work. It is by that same power that we are here to-day, and thehand of God is in all these matters. We wish to do all the good we canwhat little time we spend in the flesh, and I feel in my heart to say, Godbless you, God bless my friends and those who visit us, and bless all menthat try to do what is right. As long as we do what is right we will re-ceive the blessings of God. As has been said here to-day, every man, except the sons of perdition, will receive some kind of salvation. There is one glory of the sun, there is another glory of the moon, there is another glory of the stars, and as one star differs from another star in glory, soalso will it be in the resurrection. All of us will be judged according to the deeds done in the body. We have but a little time to live upon theearth. If we live to be a hundred years old, it is a very short span when compared with eternity. We are here upon a mission, and a few of ushave been called to labor in preaching the Gospel. We have done whatwe could in this matter, that our garments might be clean from the bloodof all men.I pray that the spirit of the Lord may guide and direct us, and give uswisdom in all that we do, that when we go into the presence of God we may be counted worthy to receive salvation and eternal life, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

TheSaints have often heard me testifyconcerning the power by which this Church has been established. I have no power, nor have these apos-tles, to preach the Gospel and build up the kingdom of God, except bythe inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Whatever testimony we bear to be productive of good, must be by the Spirit of God. We live in the great-est of all dispensations, and thereare many things which the Lordhas withheld from the foundation of the world, and which have neverbefore been revealed to man, whichwill be revealed to the Saints of this dispensation.Every dispensation of the Gospel has had its work, and at no time hasGod ever set His hand to do a work among men, without having an ele-ment prepared to work with. This is true of this dispensation. Godhas raised up a prophet in this age,and to him sent messengers who had once lived in the flesh. The Lord raised up Joseph who was soldinto Egypt, and who did the workappointed to him. So the Lordraised up Joseph Smith, at the timeset for him to appear and performHis work, and to him He revealedthe same Gospel which was revealedto Abraham and Moses and to the prophets. It is the only Gospel God ever revealed to man. In ful-fillment of the revelations of St.John, and other Scriptures, thisGospel was revealed to Joseph Smith. It cost him his life to pro-

 time He commenced His ministrations among the people until He was crucified. Joseph Smith lived some fourteen years, if I mistake not, after he organized this Church. He also was slain. But before he died he organized the Church with Apostles, Patriarchs, Pastors, Teachers, and the whole government of the Church of God; and that Priesthood heorganized or laid the foundations of remained with the people after hisdeath, as Brother Roberts has said to-night. The Twelve Apostles stoodnext to the First Presidency of the Church; and I am a living witnessmyself to this work. I am a living witness to the testimony that Josephgave to the Twelve Apostles when all of us received our endowmentsunder his hands. I remember the last speech that he ever gave us beforehis death. It was before we started upon our mission to the East. Hestood upon his feet some three hours. The room was filled as with con-suming fire, his face was as clear as amber, and he was clothed upon bythe power of God. He laid before us our duty. He laid before us thefullness of this great work of God; and in his remarks to us he said: "Ihave had sealed upon my head every key, every power, every principle oflife and salvation that God has ever given to any man who ever livedupon the face of the earth. And these principles and this Priesthood andpower belong to this great and last dispensation which the God of heavenhas set His hand to establish in the earth. Now," said he, addressingthe Twelve, "I have sealed upon your heads every key, every power, andevery principle which the Lord has sealed upon my head." And con-tinuing, he said, "I have lived so long—up to the present time—I havebeen in the midst of this people and in the great work and labor of re-demption. I have desired to live to see this Temple built. But I shallnever live to see it completed; but you will—you will." Now, we didn'tsuppose but what he would live. We didn't understand what he meant.Neither did the Twelve in the days of the Savior understand what Hemeant when He said "I am going away from you; if I go not the Com-forter will not come unto you." And so we did not understand Josephwhen he said he would not live to see that Temple completed, but wewould. Probably it was not given for us to understand at that time.After addressing us in this manner he said: "I tell you, the burden ofthis kingdom now rests upon your shoulders; you have got to bear it offin all the world, and if you don't do it you will be damned." That waspretty strong language, but it was full of meaning, it was full of signifi-cance. Joseph was trained in the Priesthood perfectly well before he cameto this planet. He understood the Priesthood perfectly well before hecame here. He understood its work and its lineage. He also understoodperfectly well that he was going away from this earth; but we did notknow it until after he was put to death. I was in Boston with PresidentYoung the very hour he and his brother Hyrum were killed—the verymoment they were slain. And in that moment there was a power of dark-ness surrounded us, a feeling of heaviness that I never felt before. I havenever seen President Young feel so badly in my life before as he did thathour.After that hour we departed for our mission, not knowing anything of

 Forty-First Semi-Annual Con-ference of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.The Forty-first Semi-Annual Confer-ence convened in the New Tabernacle,Salt Lake City, at 10 a.m., on this the Sixth day of October, 1871.The names of the authorities andleading elders on the stand being muchthe same as published in the minutes ofthe Special Conference held yesterday,it is deemed unnecessary to includethem in these.FRIDAY, Oct. 6th, 10 a.m."Ye wond'ring nations, now give ear."was sung by the choir.The opening prayer was offered upby Elder Orson Pratt.The choir sang:"See! all creation joinsTo praise th' eternal God."ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF ad-dressed the Conference. All of his ex-perience confirmed him in the faiththat we were entirely dependent on the Almighty for all things. The servants of God bore record that the work we were engaged in was true. They did not gain this knowledge through hear-ing others testify to its truthfulness. Each individual must receive it forhimself or herself, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This has been theprinciple upon which the people ofGod in all days had relied. Upon thisprinciple he could testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God, raised up as an instrument to usher in the great last dispensation. He had been intimately acquainted with the prophet, whom he knew to have been animated with a fervent desire to bless and benefit his fellowmen. Joseph Smith was taught by holy messengers. These were his teachers, and they in-formed him that the time had come for the establishment of the kingdom of God on the earth, which would gather people out of every system and sect in the world. He labored faith-fully in laying the foundation of the great work of the Lord until he sealedhis testimony with his blood. Although he was slain, the principles he sacri-ficed his life to establish still lived and flourished.President Brigham Young was beforethe world. He had been acquainted with him since 1833, and could bear record, with uplifted hand before heav-en, that he never had heard him give any counsel to any person other than was consonant with principles of peace and righteousness. His course had been one of uprightness and justice. Many then in meeting knew that he had been a true man in every respectWhen the dark days existed among the Saints at Kirtland, when it was almostas much as a man's life was worth to confess that Joseph Smith was a proph-et of God, Brigham Young upheld and sustained the prophet. He came with him to these valleys, when they presented a barren and uninviting appearance, and now look at the great work that had been accom-plished here, through his untiring en-ergy and wisdom in the hands of God, and in connection with his brethren.He continued speaking for some timelonger, expressing his desires concern[ing]-the salvation of the human race, allud-ed to his travels and labors for that pur-pose, and showed the extent and disin-terestedness of the labors of the Elders of the Church in carrying the gospel to the nations. He explained the relig-ious rights to which all men were en-titled, stating that God the Father and Jesus Christ the Redeemer allowed the human race perfect liberty in this res-pect, and no man or class of men had the least right to curtail it. The con-stitution of the country guaranteed it to all. He also discoursed on the patri-archal order of marriage, explained theeternal nature of that ordinance, and the only way by which the social or family relations formed here could be binding in the world to come. He was willing, and so were the great bulk ofthe Latter-day Saints, to obey every good and constitutional law enacted by the government of our country. With laws, however, which were designed to infringe upon his or their rights, as freemen, he could not say quite somuch.The building of Temples was men-tioned by the speaker. The saints should be energetic in performing that work, that those sacred and holy ordi-nances necessary for the salvation of the dead might be attended to. 
 Heber, City, May 4, 1895.Wilford Woodruff.Dear President.In ascer to your inquiery how I feal in regard to my call to suthern states mission. I can say I feal it my duty as a Latter day Saint, to respond to my call made of me by those placed over me. I feal pleased that the Lord thinks I am worthy to go, and promulgate the Gospel to those that sit in darkness. I am not very well poasted in the scriptures.But I am willen to go and tell what I do know, Bleaving the Lord will instruct me in many more princeples pertaining to the Gospel. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STARclaim those teachings. It costJesus and the apostles their livesalso. Jesus was a Jew, through the loins of Judah, yet he incurred thehatred of the Jewish nation. Is it not strange that a righteous mancannot stand up among the peopleand not incur their hatred?There was a war in heaven. Luci-fer and one-third of the hosts of heaven rebelled and were cast out. That warfare has never ceased, but has been manifested in every dis-pensation of the Gospel committed to man. Did Jesus undertake to please the Jews? No. He was faith-ful to the mission He had received from His Father, without regard to whether the Jews were pleased withHim or not. The Lord revealed toMoses and all the prophets of every age that a Savior would be born to redeem mankind. In the meridianof time He appeared, and organizedHis Church. The apostles whomHe chose faithfully labored to spread the work which He introduced. Butit cost a great sacrifice to belong to the Church of Christ in those days. The persecution of the Saints wasso great, that at length the lastman bearing the priesthood dis-appeared from the earth, and the Church went into the wilderness.This opposition to the Church will continue until He comes to reignwhose right it is to reign, and cast Satan into the place prepared forhim, where he can no more deceive the nations. There are different degrees of glory to which men will attain. The number of men whowill reach the highest is few, forthere are not many who are willingto make in the flesh the sacrificenecessary to entitle them to it.We cannot please the wicked. In order to do so, every Latter-daySaint would have to deny every principle God has revealed to us.I have been with this Church more than fifty years. I can testify thatwhatever the world may say, Joseph Smith was one of the greatest proph-ets that God ever raised up, saveJesus only.The Savior said on the cross, ofthose who were the cause of His death, "Father, forgive them, theyknow not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##]Theydid not know what they did. They did not comprehend what they would have to pass through in con-sequence of having shed the blood of the Son of God any more than did the mob who slew Joseph Smith.The yoke remains on the neck ofthe Jewish nation to-day. Our business is to honor God and serveHim. Our aim is eternal life. It will pay any man that ever breathedto keep the commandments of God and to be virtuous and upright. I sayto the Saints, "Fear not, little children; it is your Father's good will and pleasure to give you the kingdom."Brother Cannon this morning delivered one of the most solemndiscourses ever uttered by any man. What he said was true. I am pained to see the increase of crime in all its various and most hideous shapesin my own and other nations. Thesethings are noticed by heaven. Ifyou want to know what is going tocome to pass, read the Revelations of St. John. They will be fulfilled.After two-thirds of the inhabitantsare destroyed, the other third will continue in wickedness and unbelief.There is no power on earth cangovern the Almighty. No nation committing sin can escape the judg-ment of God.If you are curtailed in any of your privileges you may know that God will hold responsible those who caused the curtailment. JosephSmith said if he had power he would sustain every man and wo-man on earth in their religious liberty. I know that this is the Gospelof Christ, the Zion spoken of by theprophets, and God will sustain it tothe end of time.  I have never seenany reason, since I became identi-fied with the work of God, to desertit. I bear my testimony to the Latter-day Saints concerning thesethings. I pray that you all may befaithful. If you are, you will besatisfied when you get behind thevail. There are many to-day whowould lay down their lives for thework of God, if it were necessary.All classes of men will have to gointo the spirit world, and will finally

 CACHE COUNTY, "the granary of Utah." In that golden chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah, there is no brighter link than CashNo other county within the Territory can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won-derful and picturesque suroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more variedscenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand inhabitants, Logan, the countyseat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache County is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be desired, short, mildwinters and the balance of the year such as cannot be excelled. Cache County has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The Agricultural College, capable of accommodating 1000 students, is a creditable institution and worthy patronage. All lines of business are represented here, such in the west, "the best show and plow factories, nurseries, etc., all doing a safe and profitable trade. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en-joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further.Logan, Utah Feb 23 1895Prest.

 this terrible tragedy until we received an account of their death some timeafterwards. We were then informed that the Prophets of God were slain.We returned to Nauvoo. It has been repeated to you here to-night what was done at that conference in Nauvoo. I do not know whether there is any one present here to-night but myself who was there at the conference—there are but few living who were present on that occasion. Brigham stepped forth as a leader of Israel, as has been said here to-night by Brother Roberts, and Sidney Rigdon also tried to get the Presidency; but when his name was put to a vote before the conference of the Latter-day Saints, and they were asked if they wanted him as their leader, as their president, as their guardian to lead them, to guide them and direct them to the celestial kingdom, Brigham said: "All who do, raise your right hand," and I did not see a hand raised in his favor in that congregation.He (Brigham) then asked if they wanted the Twelve Apostles to step forth and magnify their calling and build up the Church and establish the kingdom of God in all the earth—"All who do, raise your right hand," and almost every soul in that congregation voted; and when Brigham Young arose and commenced speaking, as has been said, if my eyes had not been so I could see, if I had not seen him with my own eyes, there is no one that could have convinced me that it was not Joseph Smith speak-ing. It was as the voice and face of Jeseph Smith; and any one can tes-tify to this who was acquainted with these two men.Several men have claimed authority to lead the Church, but the ProphetJoseph never conferred any such authority upon any man. The keys of the Presidency after his death were held by the Twelve Apostles, and by them only, until the Council of the First Presidency was reorganized.I name these things to show that the Lord has put His mark of approvalupon the acts of the Apostles who followed the Prophet Joseph Smith in the establishment of this great work upon the earth; and the Priesthood shall continue here and the work increase until Jesus Christ shall come in the clouds of heaven.I wish here to ask a question.  How has every man who has gone on hisown authority and left the Church and undertaken to build up the Church,succeeded? How has he prospered, how has he done? Why, just as theydid who tried to establish "Strangism," and "Rigdonism," and everyother "ism" that has ever arisen. They have gone overboard. Thepower and influence of God have not been with them; the Priesthood hasnot been with them; the Lord has not called them to do that work; theytried, and the result has been a failure—a complete failure every time.On the other hand, how has He prospered and blessed those who havegone forth to the nations of the earth and declared the Gospel of Christto the millions upon millions of their fellow men? Why, He has prosperedand blessed them richly, and opened their way to success. Who are theywho have gone forth to the nations of the earth and who have visited theislands of the sea, and have accomplished this great work of gathering,built cities and reclaimed the desert? Not those who tried to lead differ-ent factions from the Church, not those who were ambitious to lead thepeople of God; but it has been the Elders of Israel, those who have re-

 ceived the Priesthood from the hands of Joseph Smith and his followers,or through the authority which God gave them. Who are they who camehere to these valleys of the mountains which had been pointed out by thefinger of God? Who are they who have built these temples and erectededifices to the great Jehovah? Why, it is the same class of men that wastrue to Joseph, those who have been true to God and the covenants theyhave made. Has God made any mistake? Read the revelations of theAlmighty; they speak for themselves. The Lord has appointed thispeople to come to this land; this is a great work; we are living in a greatdispensation—the dispensation of the last days. The Lord has not de-ceived any one in this matter; He will deceive no man in regard to thiswork. This people have traveled from place to place ever since the organ-ization of this Church, until to-day they are settled here in the valleys ofthese mountains and have prospered and increased marvelously; and theywill continue to grow and increase in strength and power until Christcomes upon the earth.A man cannot leave this Church without the power of God leaves him.It has been the power of the Priesthood that made men great; and noman can handle it only according to the order of God. If they do theywill fall, as has been stated in the revelations of God read by BrotherRoberts this evening. I want to say to the young men of Israel, go anddo what is right; you need have no fears regarding the authority of thiswork. The Lord has called the weak things of this earth. He has calledthem from the plow, from the plane and workshop and the hammer—Hehas taken the illiterate men of the world and sent them forth to preachthe Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth. Even the Lord Jesus Christwas born in a stable and cradled in a manger. He came forth and fulfilledthe prophecies. His whole life was one of poverty and affliction. He wasscorned and hated by the world of mankind. His Apostles were selectedfrom among the poor and the humble of the earth. So it is with the menwho have led the Church in these days. They have been called fromvarious vocations. They have been men who were humble, and God hasbeen with them. God has established His work, and He has sent ministersto the different nations of the earth.I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints, all that we have to do is to befaithful, to keep His commandments, to be humble, to seek Him in mightyprayer, and all will be well with us.There has been a great deal of work done in this dispensation. TheLord called this people here to the valleys of the mountains in fulfilmentof prophecy. Old father Jacob, in blessing Joseph and Ephraim, toldthem what would take place to them and their posterity to the latestgeneration; that their blessings should extend to the utmost bounds ofthe everlasting hills. We are here as descendants of Joseph and Ephraim,and Abraham, who were patriarchs and holy men of God. They had thePriesthood, and it has been continued and handed down from generationto generation as long as God has had a people upon the earth. He hasrevealed it in this dispensation through the Prophet Joseph, and it is hereto stay, and will remain until Christ comes.

 Elder W. Woodruff. Truly has it been said, that we are growing in knowledge and wisdom,and feel the hand of God guiding us; yet this people have one fault, and that is, to run to a Gentile store and spend the last dollar they've got, in preference to going to a brother in the church; it is an error in Israel, and should be stopped. How long will you sustain men, who do not support this kingdom, in preference to supporting yourselves? The men who draw the very life's blood of the community in Nauvoo, were the first to draw the steel upon us and drive us from our homes, and I fear not to say, that if the saints were to leave these valleys, and the Gentiles were to take possession of our houses, and our farms, they could not live here, and a famine would be in these valleys, in their midst.

 W. WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS,TO THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.I deem it to be a duty which I owe to God and his church, to express my feelings and bear my testimony unto you, concerning certain things that are presented toyou for your consideration; especially, the claims of elder Sidney Rigdon to theexclusive right to lead and govern the church of Latter-day Saints. I have care-fully examined the trial which elder Rigdon has had before the authorities of the church in Nauvoo, as given in the Times and Seasons, Vol. v. No. 17, and I am satisfied that a righteous decision has been given in his case. I do not make these remarks without my reasons, and I will hereby give those reasons.I will commence by asking where has elder Rigdon been since he made his flaming speech in Far West, which had a tendency to bring persecution upon the whole church, especially the head of it? Has he stood by the side of the prophet and patriarch as a true friend, to assist in carrying them through their trials, tribu-lations, and persecutions? Has he walked up into his place as a man of God, and stood beside the prophet as his counsellor? Has he in any way, been a pillar orsupport to the church, from that day until this? Has he sustained the cause, and used an influence to spread the work abroad since the persecution in Far West? Has he in any way sustained the priesthood with dignity and honour, for the last five years of his life? Or, has the prophet, in any point of view, leaned upon himas a counsellor, a staff, or support, for the last five years? Or has the prophetJoseph found elder Rigdon in his councils, when he organized the quorum of the Twelve a few months before his death, to prepare them for the endowment? Andwhen they received their endowment, and actually received the keys of the kingdom of God, and oracles of God, keys of revelation, and the pattern of heavenly things; and thus addressing the Twelve, exclaimed, "upon your shoulders the kingdom rests, and you must round up your shoulders and bear it, for I have had to do it until now. But now the responsibility rests upon you. It mattereth not what becomes of me." I say, has this been the case with elder Rigdon, in any wise.No, no, verily no; but the reverse, until he had become like a millstone upon the back of Joseph Smith, the prophet, seer, and revelator. And I hereby bear my testimony, that I heard the said Joseph Smith declare, that elder Rigdon had be-come like a millstone upon his back—a dead weight—and he had carried him long enough, and must throw him off; and in my hearing requested one of the quorum of the Twelve to bring him up before the Church, that he might be dealt withaccording to the law of the Church, that he might be cut off as a dead branch, and no longer encumber the tree, as there was sufficient testimony against him. But through the pleadings of brother Hyrum Smith and others, he has been spared. Elder Brigham Young has been his friend—spoke in his favour, in consequence of his age and former standing, hoping that he might reform, get the spirit of the work, and magnify his calling. Upon this principle he has been sustained long, until the branch became twice dead, and necessary to be severed from the tree. Elder Rigdon, for the last five years of his life, has mostly been shut up in the post-office; confined himself mostly to his own temporal affairs, manifesting but little interest in the affairs of the church; and when any alarm or report was in circulation unfavourable to the cause, if we could judge at all from the course he

WATT.)I will say to my brethren and sisters that I count it a blessing and a privilege to occupy a few moments this morning in bearing my testimo-ny and expressing my feelings to you; and I hope what little I may say may be dictated by the Ho-ly Spirit, for I have lived long enough in this world to know that I can neither edify myself nor the children of men without the Holy Spirit.I have a few thoughts upon my mind which I wish to present. Since I have attended this con-ference I have listened attentively to the teach-ings, counsels, reproof, corrections, testimoniesand subjects which have been given to us by the servants of God.It brings to mind the days before I heard 'Mor-monism.' I have spent hours and days and nights, among the rocks and in the forest, praying to Almighty God to enlighten my mind and lead me in the paths of rectitude and duty and that hewould let me live to behold a people he could own, who did receive the revelations of Jesus Christ, the gospel, the principles and covenants which the ancients received and enjoyed.The lord revealed to me that I should have this privilege, and I have lived to see the kingdom of God set up; it is before me today, in this taber-nacle, and all the blessings of the priesthood, and all the covenants and all the power necessary tolead a people into salvation is here to-day.I want to say in answer to my feelings, that as I realize the kingdom of God is here, I realizealso that we have a leader to it. We live in a great and important day and generation, we livein the midst of the almighty work of God, in a time when he has stretched out his hand to accom-plish that great and mighty work in fulfilment of the word of God written in the volume of reve-lation which points to our day.Any man who has a particle of the Spirit of God can see that there was great things to trans-pire in our day. We are in our alphabet: thereare but a few of the works of Almighty God that have yet been declared in our ears in com-parison to that which is to come. No man is qualified to stand at the head of the house of Israel to carry out the great purposes of our Godunless he is inspired by the Almighty all the time. We have such men at our head; Joseph Smith was of that class; From his childhood, or fromthe time the angel rent the vail of eternity and showed him the record of Ephraim until the dayof his death, he was led by the hand of God. No man had any business to say unto him, why dost thou so? He was a shaft in the hand of the Al-mighty.It is not less so now with President Young, who stands at the head of this people, for he does point out the way in which this people should walk. Who is going to take hold of the Ark and steady it for him? No man; President Younghas the right to make use of my name or yours before the people by way of correction; it is not our business to call him to an account for it; he has a right to correct, reprove and guide us, and he has had to do so all the day long, and he has been afather to this people continually. I have been acquainted with him and traveled with him for many years; and I will say I have felt many a time to thank God that he has given to us fath-ers as leaders and teachers who have been filled with mercy and compassion, and with the words of eternal life.I have wondered many a time in my life how I have passed along so smoothly as I have. I havefelt that I have been worthy of correction in a good many things; yet I desire to pursue a course whereby I may become justified. I have my weaknesses, errors and follies, and can see themby the light of the Holy Spirit.There is nothing I have ever done in my life that was wrong but what I have been sorry for. I know President Young is endowed with the power of God and so do you know it, and I know he can discover weaknesses in many of usand he corrects us for our good. The reproofs of a friend are far better than the kisses of an enemy.With regard to correcting the Twelve or anybody else, I am glad when we are corrected to see the brethren kiss the rod. We have to learnto build up this kingdom before we are prepared as polished shafts in the hands of the Lord to stand up and magnify our calling as Apostles of Jesus Christ. There is nothing that President Young brings forth for this people to carry out but we are all interested in, whether we under-stand it or not.Should I, or any man in the kingdom of Godfeel for a moment to object to President Young'shandling or controlling gold or wealth for his own benefit or the rolling of the kingdom? No, we should not. I wish he had his millions, for he has clearly manifested before our eyes from the be-ginning until now his talents and gifts as a finan-cier; and we all know he has been profitable tothe Church and kingdom of God, to Zion and this whole people. It matters not to me whetherit is in build a Temple, establishing a Carrying Company or anything else that is presented forthe accomplishment of the purposes of the Lord and the building up of his kingdom and the gath-ering of Israel, we are equally interested in it and should go to with our might and carry out the work assigned us.Many things will be made manifest unto usand our labors will have to extend through many channels, ways and means before the way is pre-pared for the coming of the Son of Man.I feel thankful to God that his hand is over us. He has guided, controlled and delivered us from the hands of our enemies.We may thank the Lord that we have a man among us who has got the Holy Ghost enough to reprove sin whether among his wives or his bestfriends or worst enemies. What would become of this people were it not so? We would go to hell. No man can govern his steps, control hislife, and correct his errors, if there is not somebodyinspired by the power of God to lead in this matter.There is a just cause many times for reproof and correction, and it is a good sign to me when we are reproved; It shows there are redeeming qualities in this people. When President Young wants anything of us, I care not what, let us re-spond to his request. We have to build up this kingdom by union and faithfully following thosemen set to lead us, or else we will be scattered;The blessings of God will be taken from us, if wetake any other course.The Presidency in their remarks here have re-ferred to the hatred of the wicked against us.—Jesus says, ‘I have chosen you out of the worldtherefore the world hate you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own, but be-cause I have chosen you out of the world, there-fore the world hate you.'Look at the world; they are divided on every point; there is hardly two men or women united in matters of government or religion. Send an Elder of this Church to proclaim to them the Gospel of Jesus Christ and you will see the devils in hell united with the priests and people of christen-dom to oppose him. They know they are wick-ed and weltering in their own corruptions andabominations. But here comes a man to pro-claim to them the word of God—why do they oppose him? Because he has the testimony of Jesus Christ, and is sent of God. Do the world believe we have a false religion, that we are de-ceivers, and have not the true faith? No, theyare afraid that what we preach is too true; they are afraid of our union in the Valleys of the mountains; it has more terror in it to the kings of the earth than any other subject that has been re-vealed to man in this generation. They are afraid God is with this people; that he controls them.The same feeling exists among the nations now as anciently, when the Jews said He (Jesus) willtake away our place and nation if he is let alone. This should be a testimony to all the world when they see the spirit of division increasing uponalmost every subject. They cannot unite uponany subject only in opposing the Latter Day Saints.I feel to say to my brethren and sisters, let us make up our minds to do right, and let our union increase, and truly follow the men God has set to lead us. There is where our salvation lies.Some of us have been in a measure reprovedand corrected; well, what of it? no doubt we de-served all we have got and more; we should not boast over each other because one man is reproved to-day; you may receive the rod of chastisementto-morrow.Let us prepare ourselves so that in whatsoever we are corrected we may be passive in the hands of the servants of God and thank the Lord; for whom the Lord loves he chastens and scourgesevery son and daughter he receives.When I get through, if I can only find myself associated with the Twelve Apostles of the Lat-ter Day Saints and with this people, I will be satisfied. If I can steer my way through this life, and have a place with you, it is all I will ask.I pray the Lord to bless you and me, and more particularly the Presidency of this church, and clothe them with the power of God and with sal-vation, that their hearts may be filled with joy, light and truth. And may this people rise up and humble themselves before the Lord and take the counsel that is given to them that we may be well educated in the things of God, and be obedientchildren in treasuring up their teachings and in carrying them out, that we may be saved in the kingdom of God; which is my prayer in the name of Jesus: Amen. 
 116  THE DESERET NEWS. April 14.ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF nextspoke: Joseph Smith laid the founda-tion of a great work that was to be ac-complished by those who should fol-low, after. The day has come when thesaints will have to take hold of tempor-al matters in a proper manner. It hasbeen said that the introduction of thetrue order of temporal things will provean antidote to grasping dishonesty.This is true. We have been enrichingmany who would willingly have soldevery member of the Church andKingdom of God for a dollar each, andthought they had made a good bargain. This should cease. We areliving in a momentous period, a timewhen God will bring about His great purposes. Joseph Smith was commis-sioned by the Almighty to inaugurateHis great work. His mantle has fallenupon President Young to carry thatwork forward. In the vision of my mind I can see a mighty people; I cansee the Jews setting their faces East-ward for the Holy land. May the Lordso bless us that we may understand ourposition. I pray that I may see theOrder of Enoch introduced. I praythat God may bless President Young,that he may live to see the accomplish-ment of that for which he has labored somany years. 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED AT THEForty-sixth Semi-annual Conferenceof the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, in the NewTabernacle, on the Morning ofFriday, Oct. 8th, 1875.REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS."OH Death, where is thy sting? Ohgrave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the gift ofGod is eternal life, through ourLord and Savior Jesus Christ." [##1 Corinthians 15:55-57##]This doctrine of the resurrection ofthe dead is most glorious. It is comforting, at least to my spirit,to think, that, in the morning ofthe resurrection, my spirit willhave the privilege of dwelling inthe very same body that it occupiedhere. As Elders of Israel we have traveled a great many thousandmiles in weariness and fatigue, la-boring to preach the gospel of Je-sus Christ to the children of men.I would be very glad to have the same body in the resurrection withwhich I waded swamps, swam riv-ers and traveled and labored to build up the kingdom of God hereon the earth. I like this, I rejoice in the privilege we enjoy at thisConference, of meeting with so many Latter-Day Saints. I feelthat we have had a good deal ofthe Spirit of the Lord with us, andI hope that it may continue until we get through, with the Confer-ence.President Young referred, yester-day, in his remarks, to the experi-ence of some of us in past days. Ihave reflected a good deal upon these things as well as on the fu-ture. I have long been associated with the kingdom of God, and Iwish to refer for a moment to whatwas said yesterday on that subject.The mission then mentioned wasone of much interest to the Twelve, if not to the Church. The whole of that mission to England, fromthe beginning to the end, placedthe Apostles in such a position thatthey had to walk by faith from firstto last. The Lord gave a revelation,with date, day, month and year, when they were to go up to lay thecorner-stone in Caldwell county,Far West, Missouri. When thatrevelation was given all was peaceand quietude, comparatively, in that land. But when the time came for the Twelve Apostles tofulfill that revelation, the Saints hadall been driven out by the extermi-nating order of Governor Boggs,and it was as much as a man's lifewas worth, especially one of theTwelve, to be found in that State;and when the day came on whichwe were commanded by the Lordin that revelation to go up and laythe corner-stone of that Temple,and there take the parting hand with the Saints, to cross the watersto preach the gospel in England, the inhabitants of Missouri had sworn that if all the other revela-tions of "old Joe Smith" were ful-filled, that should not be, becauseit had a day and date to it.President Young asked theTwelve who were with him—"What shall we do with regard tothe fulfillment of this revelation?"He wanted to know their feelings. Father Smith, the Patriarch, saidthe Lord would take the will for the deed; others said the Lord couldnot expect the Twelve Apostles to go up and sacrifice their lives to fulfil that revelation; but the Spirit of the Lord rested upon the Twelve,and they said—"The Lord God has spoken, and we will fulfill that reve-lation and commandment;["] and thatwas the feeling of President Young and of those who were with him! We went through that State, andwe laid that corner-stone. GeorgeA. Smith and myself were ordainedto the Apostleship on that corner-stone upon that day. We returnedin safety and not a dog to move histongue, and no man shed our blood.As soon as we got home we pre-pared ourselves to go on our mis-sion to England, and, as PresidentYoung has said, the devil undertookto kill us. I have myself been in Tennessee and Kentucky for two or three years, where, in the Fall, there was not well persons enoughto take care of the sick during the ague mouths, and yet I never hadthe ague in my life until called togo upon that mission to England. There was not one solitary soul inthe Quorum of the Twelve but what the devil undertook to de-stroy; and, as was said yesterday, when Brother Taylor and my-self, the two first of the quorumready for the trip, were on hand tostart, I was shaking with the ague, and I had it every other day, and on my well day, when I did not have it, my wife had it. I got upand laid my hands upon her andblessed her, and blessed my child,having only one at the time, and Istarted across the river, and that man who sits behind me to-day, the President of the church andkingdom of God upon the earth,paddled me across the Missouri river in a canoe, and that is the way I landed in Nauvoo. I lay down on a side of sole leather bythe old postoffice, and I did not know where to go, and I was notable to stand on my feet, and I laydown there. By and by the Pro-phet came along and said he—"Brother Woodruff, you are goingon your mission?" "Yes," I said,"but I feel more like a subject forthe dissecting room than for a mis-sion." He reproved me for what Isaid and told me to get up and go.Brother Taylor, the only memberof the Quorum of the Twelve who was well, and I traveled together, and on the way he fell to the groundas though he had been knocked on the head with an axe. Old Father Coulton was carrying us, and Bro-ther Taylor fell twice in that way,taken with the bilious fever, and no man in that quorum could boast that he went on that missionwithout feeling the hand of thedestroyer, for it was laid upon usall. I had the shaking ague, and lay on my back in a wagon, andwas rolled over stumps and stones,until it seemed as if my life wouldbe shaken out of me. I left Bro-ther Taylor behind, by his advice,for said he, "We are both sick, andif you stay you can't do anythinghere;" so old Father Coulton car-ried me along in his wagon until I got to Buffalo, N. Y. Fromthere I traveled alone to Farming-ton, Connecticut, my native place, and I stayed there fifteen days at my father's house, coughing andshaking every day. My fathernever expected that I should leavemy bed, and my step-mother did not think that I should ever get better. A message came from anuncle of mine, who had just died, and his last words were—"I want you to send for Friend Wilford, Iwant him to come and preach my funeral sermon." My father said—"You can't go and preach that ser-mon, for you can't sit up in your bed." Said I—"Never mind, get up your horse and wagon;" and hedid so and I got into it, and rodeover that morning in a chilly wind,and the hour that my ague was coming on I got before a big blaz-ing fire and preached the funeralsermon of my friend, and the ague left me from that day, and I went back and went on my way re-joicing.In process of time Brother Taylor came along and he and I crossed the ocean to-gether, and arrived in England, and hereI want to make a little statement of myexperience in those days concerning cir-cumstances that took place with me.When Brother Brigham left home he toldyou that all his family had was one barrelof rotten flour. Two hundred cents would have bought every pound of provision I left with my family when I lefthome, But we left our wives, for we hadthe commandment of God upon us, andwe were either going to obey it, or die try-ing. That was the spirit of the elders ofIsrael; and I blessed my wife and childand left them in the hands of God, and tothe tender mercies of our noble bishops,and those who were acquainted with them know how it was in those days. However, I went on my way, and I want to speak of one little circumstance. I had with mean old cloak which I got in Tennessee when traveling with Brother Smoot overforty years ago. It. had once been a dan-dy cloak, and had on keg buttons, and when new had a good deal of trimming and fancy work about it; but it was thenpretty well threadbare and worn out. I woreit in Kirtland and I carried it to Englandwith me; and when I was called by reve-lation to go to John Benbow's and preachthe gospel I wore that cloak. I went thereand found over six hundred people, called United Brethren, and among themwere eighty-three preachers, and they, asa people, were prepared for the word of the Lord, and I wanted to catch them in the gospel net. Before embracing thedoctrine of the United Brethren, SisterBenbow had been what is called a "lady"in England, and she had worn her silksand satins; but after obeying the doctrineof this religious body she cut up andburned and destroyed her silks and satinsand wore the plainest calicoes she could get, because she thought that was relig-ion. When I went there to preach she looked at me with this old cloak with the keg buttons on, and the Spirit of theLord bore testimony to me that religion,so far as she was concerned, had a gooddeal of tradition about it, and that her faith could be tried by the coat a man wore; and as Paul said, if eating meat of-fended his brethren, he would never eat any more, so I felt a good deal, and onemorning I went out and cut off the but-tons from my old cloak, and never had a button on it afterwards. [##1 Corinthians 8:13##] By doing thisand some other things, which some perhapswould call foolish, I, through the blessing of God and with the assistance of Brother Young, George A. Smith and Willard Rich-ards, caught the whole flock and baptizedevery, soul except one solitary person into the church and kingdom of God. Many of them are here in this room to-day, and someof them have passed away. I mention thisjust to show our position. We travelled without purse and scrip, and we preachedwithout money and without price. Why?Because the God of heaven had called up-on us to go forth and warn the world.Now I want to say again, I have looked around within the last few years and Ihave thought, Where, Oh where, are thesons of the Prophets, Apostles, and fath-ers in Zion, preparing in these last daysto rise up and bear off this kingdom whenwe are on the other side of the vail? Sometimes, in thinking on this subject, I have felt that they were very few and farbetween who had the spirit of their fath-ers and were prepared to bear off this kingdom. But I thank God that I find it is now something like it was in the daysof Elijah. When the Prophet said, refer-ring to the followers of Baal—"They havekilled thy prophets, and pulled down thinealtars, and I alone am left," the Lord said—"Oh no, I have seven thousand menin Israel who have not yet bowed the kneeto Baal." [##1 Kings 19:14-18##] Well, I begin to feel, since I have heard the testimonies of our youngbrethren at this Conference, that some ofthe sons of the servants of God are becom-ing filled with the fire and spirit of the prophets. We want a good many ofthem to rise up and bear off this king-dom.Now I want to say a word or two on an-other subject. I have heard some of ourbrethren remark—"If the Twelve apos-tles have the word of the Lord, we wouldlike to receive it." I want to say a few words with regard to the word of theLord. I think that many of this people are mistaken with regard to the word ofthe Lord. They sometimes wonder whyPresident Young does not give them theword of the Lord. I have been acquaint-ed with President Young more than fortyyears. It is over forty years since I trav-elled a thousand miles with him, JosephSmith, Orson Hyde, Orson Pratt, CharlesC. Rich, and many others perhaps in thiscongregation, and I never saw a day fromthat day until the present, but what Pres-ident Brigham Young, even before theTwelve Apostles were organized, always had the word of the Lord for the people; and instead of thinking there is no wordof the Lord, my faith is that there is not an Elder in Israel who has any business topreach, unless he has the word of the Lordto the people. The Twelve Apostles shouldhave the word of the Lord to the people;the High Priesthood should have the wordof the Lord to the people; these four thousand Seventies, the messengers of Is-rael to the nations of the earth, should have the word of the Lord to the people;and every Elder of Israel, when he speaks,should have the word of the Lord, and the whole Church and kingdom of God, men and women, should have, for him-self and herself, the testimony of Je-sus Christ, which is the spirit of prophecy. This should be in the possession of every man and woman in the church, for their own government and guidance, and this has always been the teaching to us of President Brigham Young. And this is backed up by the revelations which theLord has given in these last days, as youwill find if you read the twenty-second section of the Book of Doctrine and Cov-enants. That revelation was given overforty years ago, to Elders Orson Hyde, Luke Johnson, Lyman Johnson and Wil-liam E. McLellin; and on that occasion the Lord said—"Go forth and preach thegospel to the people. And when you goforth you are called to teach the peopleand not to be taught. And you must teach as you are moved upon by the Holy Ghost, by the power of God, by the Spiritof the Lord; and when you speak as you are moved upon by the Spirit of the Lordyour words are scripture, they are the word of the Lord, they are the mind of the Lord, they are the will of the Lordand the power of God unto salvation un-to every one that hears." [##Doctrine and Covenants 68:1-4##]Yes, we have plenty of testimony withregard to these things, and I will say tomy brethren that whatever the word of the Lord may be to them I know what the word of the Lord is to me. The wordof the Lord to me is, that it is time for Zion to rise and let her light shine; andthe testimony of the Spirit of God to meis that this whole kingdom, this great kingdom of priests, this forty thousand men in these mountains of Israel, whohave borne the priesthood, have thorough-ly fulfilled one part of the parable of theten virgins. What is that? Why, that while the Bridegroom has tarried we haveall slumbered and slept; as a church andkingdom we have slumbered and slept,and the word of the Lord to me is that wehave slept long enough; and we have theprivilege now of rising and trimming ourlamps and putting oil in our vessels. Thisis the word of the Lord to me.The word of the Lord to me again, is that it is time for this whole people, theseforty thousand elders of Israel who dwell in these valleys of the mountains, and I believe that it is the word of the Lord to them, that we listen to the voice of the Lord through the lawgiver, and unite our-selves in temporal things, and that we la-bor to build up the kingdom of God, and cease to labor to build up ourselves alone,against the interests of the kingdom of God. This is the word of the Lord to meand I think it is to you.It is the word of the Lord through the mouth of his servant Brigham, and hasbeen a long time the word of the Lord tome, that as Twelve Apostles, as Seventy Apostles, as High Priests, and as Elders ofIsrael, it is time that we should rise up and bear the burden that rests upon the shoulders of Brigham Young, who is far ad-vanced in life, and has had the weight and burden of this Church and kingdomupon his shoulders. It is our duty to rise up and bear off this burden, and lift itfrom our President, and also to cry aloudunto the people to unite themselves to-gether. It is our duty to cease shakingin our shoes for fear the Lord Almightyshould give some of his words to governand control us in our temporal affairs.Who, to use a comparison, expects to havea forty-acre lot alone in the kingdom of God, or in heaven, when we get there?None need expect it, for in that kingdom,in heaven or upon earth, we shall find uni-ty, and the Lord requires at our hands that we unite together, according to the principles of his celestial law.This is what I consider to be the word of the Lord to us. It is our duty to uniteourselves together, and to sustain the in-stitutions which have been established inthese mountains by the revelations of Godunto us.There is another word of the Lord un-to me, and which has been like fire shut up in my bones for the last three months;that is, to call upon all the inhabitants ofthese mountains, as far as I have an op-portunity, to go and lay up their grain, that they may have bread. For the lastthree months I have not felt as if I couldanswer my own feelings, unless, at every meeting I have attended, I called uponthe farmers to lay up their grain. "Ohyes," say some, "Heber Kimball cried,'Famine, famine' for years, and it has not come yet." Well, bless your soaul, thereis more room for it to come. "Who am I,saith the Lord, that I promise and do notfulfill?" The day will come when if thispeople do not lay up their bread they willbe sorry for it. The Lord has felt after usin days past and gone by the visitationsof crickets and grasshoppers time after time, and had it not been for his mercy weshould have had famine upon our headslong before this. It is the duty of the farmers in these mountains not to selltheir bread, or to throw it away for a song,but to lay it up, or you will find that the day is not a great way off when you willneed it. That is the voice of the Lord tome, and it is the way I have felt for a goodwhile, and I believe it is the same to my brethren.We are living in a very important time,and the Lord has raised up this people toaccomplish his purposes; and as some ofthese revelations convey the idea, theywere chosen from before the foundationof the world. The Lord says,—"I have called you by my everlasting priesthood,and your lives have been hid with Christin God," and you have not known it. You have been called here and God has put in-to your hands his cause and kingdom, and the salvation of both Jew and Gentile. This people hold in their hands the salva-tion of the twelve tribes of Israel. It was neot to the oldest son, but to Ephraim, theson of Joseph, that these promises were made. [##Genesis 48:13-20##] Joseph was the youngest but oneof the twelve patriarchs, and through hisson Ephraim God has raised you up andhas put this power into your hands, andyou hold the keys for the salvation of Is-rael. And the ten tribes of Israel in the north country will come in remembrancebefore God in due time, and they will smite the rocks and the mountains of icewill flow down before them, and the ever-lasting hills will tremble at their presence.A highway will be cast up through the midst of the great deep for them to cometo Zion, and they will bow down in the midst thereof, and receive the priesthoodat the hands of the inhabitants of Zion.Then what manner of men ought we to be, we, who have been ordained and call-ed, and had such responsibilities placed upon us by the God of heaven? Our lives have been hid with Christ in God, and weare heirs of the eternal priesthood, through the lineage of our fathers. Thus saith the Lord through the mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who sealed his testimonywith his blood, and his testimony fromthat hour has been in force upon all the world. Know ye, Latter-day Saints, that the Lord will not disappoint you or thisgeneration with regard to the fulfillment of his promises. No matter whether theyhave been uttered by his own voice out ofthe heavens, by the ministration of angels, or by the voice of his servants in the flesh,it is the same; and though the earth pass away not one jot or tittle of his word willfall unfulfilled; There is no prophecy of Scripture of any private interpretation,but holy men of old spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and theirwords will be fulfilled to the very letter, and it certainly is time that we prepare ourselves for that which is to come. Greatthings await this generation—both Zion and Babylon. All these revelations concerning the fall of Babylon will have their fulfillment. Forty-five years ago, in speak-ing to the church, the Lord said—"You are clean, but not all, and I am not wellpleased with anv[y] who are not clean, be-cause all flesh is corrupted before my face, and darkness prevails among all the na-tions of the earth." [##Doctrine and Covenants 38:10-11##] This causes silence to reign and all eternity is pained. Theangels of God are waiting to fulfill the great commandment given forty-five years ago, to go forth and reap down the earthbecause of the wickedness of men. How do you think eternity feels to-day? Why there is more wickedness, a thou-sand times over, in the United States now,than when that revelation was given. Thewhole earth is ripe in iniquity; and theseinspired men, these elders of Israel, havebeen commanded of the Almighty to go forth and warn the world, that their gar-ments may be clear of the blood of allmen.I tell you that God will not disappoint Zion or Babylon, the heavens or the earth,in regard to the judgments which he has promised in these last days, but every oneof them will have its fulfillment upon theheads of the children of men; and when they are fully ripened in iniquity the na-tions of the earth will be swept away aswith the besom of destruction.What did the Lord say to that meek andhumble man, the brother of Jared, thou-sands of years ago with regard to theland of America—a chosen land promisedby old Father Jacob to his sons? He said that no nation should ever occupy it un-less the people thereof kept his command-ments; and if they failed to do that they should be cut off when they were ripenedin iniquity. The Lord has already sweptaway two mighty nations from this conti-nent, because they have not fulfilled his word, spoken through that humble man.The Lord chooses the weak things of the world, things which are naught to bring tonaught things which are, and he will as surely perform his work in this age of theworld as he has done in any other. We need not fear man nor the wrath of man, but fear God, who holds in his hands thedestinies of all men.Before I close my remarks, I want to say a few words to our sisters and daugh-ters in Zion, for I feel that there are somewords of the Lord to them. This is atime that the daughters of Zion shouldhearken to the words of the Prophet of God, who has been set to lead us. I feelthat it is time, forty years after they wereorganized, that the Female Relief Societiesshould labor with all their might to carry out the object of their organization by the Prophet Joseph Smith. You may ask,"What was the object of that organiza-tion?" I will say that in organizing thesesocieties there were several objects in view, some of which I will refer to before I getthrough. President Young has been call-ing upon you, as one branch of the land of Zion, to take hold and help to build itup. He desires that the sisters here in the land of Zion should govern and controlthe fashions of Zion. Instead of heaping to yourselves and imitating the fashionsthat have adorned Babylon, you should have independence enough to form your own; and those which are not comely andcomfortable should be laid aside. I, my-self, do not think it has been pleasing inthe sight of God, to see the manner in which the mothers and daughters in Zion,for years past, have been ready to adornthemselves with every fashion that Baby-lon has contrived and invented. I neednot mention all these things, but I will mention two or three. For instance, how is it with regard to the head dress of theladies? The Lord has given to women generally a fine head of hair, which, weare told in the Scriptures, is the glory ofthe woman; and she should let the hairgiven unto her adorn her head withoutadding any foreign substance, as is nowdone, in order to imitate and follow afterthe fashions of the world. Again, just as quick as the daughters of Babylon ex-tend their crinolines until they cannot move in a space less than six or eight feetwide, in a coach, assembly room, or any-where else, why the daughters of Zion must follow the same uncomely fashion.But a fashion the reverse of this is now adopted, and at the present time the daugh-ters of Babylon wear their elastics so tight that they have not room left for locomotion when walking in the streets;and, of course the daughters of Zion mustpractice the same. And now, see one of them, dressed in the height of fashion, crossing the street, and a runaway teamcomes thundering along. What a posi-tion she is in! Why the only way she cansave her life is to lie down and roll across the street like a saw log.All these fashions are uncomely andshould be laid aside. The daughters of Zion should do better than to trail silksand satins in the mud when walking in the street. The Female Relief Societiesshould lay hold of and regulate these things, and introduce fashions that are comely and comfortable; it is their dutyto do it. Again, you can do a good deal in regard to maintaining the indepen-dence of Zion, by going to and carrying out the counsel of President Young in raising your own silk for dresses, bonnets and trimmings, so that your adorningmay be the workmanship of your ownhands.I felt as though I wanted to say so muchwith regard to our sisters in Zion. Presi-dent Young says, and I know it is the truth, that this is the best people on theface of the earth. But however good wemay be we should aim continually to im-prove and become better. We have obeyeda different law and Gospel to what otherpeople have obeyed, and we have a differ-ent kingdom in view, and our aim shouldbe correspondingly higher before the Lordour God, and we should [g]overn and con-trol ourselves accordingly, and I pray God my heavenly Father that his Spirit may rest upon us and enable us to do so.Another word of the Lord to me is that,it is the duty of these young men here inthe land of Zion to take the daughters of Zion to wife, and prepare tabernacles forthe spirits of men, which are the children of our Father in heaven. They are wait-ing for tabernacles, they are ordained tocome here, and they ought to be born in the land of Zion instead of Babylon. Thisis the duty of the young men in Zion; andwhen the daughters of Zion are asked bythe young men to join with them in mar-riage, instead of asking—"Has this mana fine brick house, a span of fine horsesand a fine carriage?" they should ask—"Ishe a man of God? Has he the Spirit of God with him? Is he a Latter-day Saint? Does he pray? Has he got the Spirit uponhim to qualify him to build up the king-dom?" If he has that, never mind the carriage and brick house, take hold andunite yourselves together according to thelaw of God. I rejoice to see the popula-tion increasing in the land of Zion. Whyis it that ninety-nine women out of everyhundred over the whole land of Zion, whoare of proper age and married, are bring-ing forth posterity until our children swarm in our streets almost like bees? Be-cause the God of he[a]ven is raising up a royal priesthood, and a generation to bearoff this kingdom in the day when his judg-ments will come upon the earth. 
 Oct. 16  THE DESERET NEWS  579ELDER W. WOODRUFFSaid we, as a people, were fulfilling our destiny, and carrying out thoseprinciples and prophecies that theancient prophets foresaw. We had,therefore, a great responsibilityresting upon us to erect temples,wherein we might redeem the liv-ing and the dead.He gave some good instructionsto the Presidents of Stakes, Bishopsand other officials, and urged uponthem the necessity of each one ofthem using all his influence to sus-tain every co-operative institution,as a preparatory step towards the establishment of the United Order,which would have to be entered in-to by us as a people. We wouldhave to be united in all our tempo-ral labors to promote the principleof union for the benefit of the whole people. We were here tobuild up Zion, to establish right-eousness, and prepare ourselves andour children for the coming of theSon of Man in the clouds ofheaven. The gospel which we hadreceived was everlasting in its na-ture, there was no change, it wasalways the same in every dispensa-tion. Faith, repentance and bap-tism were eternal principles. He said that we should remember that everything which leads to good isof God, and whatever leads to evil is from the evil one.He closed his instructive remarksby praying for the blessing of God upon the Saints, that they mightbe enabled to carry out the counselthat had been given them. 
 I want to say to the young men and maidens of the Latter-day Saints,have no fears from what you hear through the outside world or from thosewho are professing to build up the kingdom of God, but who have not gotthe Priesthood as established by the Almighty through Joseph Smith. Ifyou will do your duty all will be right. I am thankful for the privilege ofliving so long. I have seen the progress of this work almost from thecommencement. I thank God for what I see to-day. I see great improve-ment, but there is still great room for improvement among us now.I wish to say to our young men, here is an evil power, a growing powerof darkness around and amongst us. The power of darkness desires tolead the young men of Israel astray. They think if they can do this, ifthey can get them to do evil and wickedly, they can weaken this Church.But our young men are raised up to follow in the footsteps of their fathers,and not to be easily led astray.I pray God my Heavenly Father to bless the Latter-day Saints, that wemay all have faith in God and in the revelations and promises He hasgiven, and in all the truths we have received, and if we do so, all will bewell with us. We have come here upon a mission. Our mission is a greatand responsible one; it is mighty. In fact, we have been called to leaveour homes, our fathers, our mothers, our wives, our children, all that isdear to us, and to go abroad to preach the Gospel to the inhabitants ofthe earth. We have been called to do this, and as Brother Joseph Smithsaid, if we do not round up our shoulders and help to bear off this king-dom, we shall be damned. No man can receive the Priesthood from thehands of the Almighty and abuse it but what it will be answered uponhis head.Therefore, let us all, old and young, improve the time, live our religion,have faith in God and His works. The Lord brought us here, His powerhas been upon us; by His power and His blessings we have built templesand beautified homes; and there has never been a people that I know ofthat have ever had the power to rear as many temples in so short a timeas we have done in the mountains of Israel. Let us remember this andbe faithful, remembering our fasting and prayers, call upon the Lord insecret prayer, and ask Him to bless and direct us.The Lord is with us, His hand is over us, and He is guiding this workand will continue to do so until Zion shall arise and be built up and shallstand in beauty and power, and become the glory of the whole earth, whilethe judgments of God shall extend throughout the nations.May God bless you as Mutual Improvement Associations, may He blessevery organization and association that has been established as helps andgovernments to this great latter day work; and may we be blessed in allour endeavors to do right, which may God grant, for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 500 THE DESERET WEEKLY.President Woodruff followed. He dwelt for some time upon the re-sponsibility of the brethren in carrying the Gospel to all peoples. In the bestow-al of the Priesthood upon men, theLord had said many were calledbut few should be chosen, thereason for many not being among thoseof final selection being that they settheir hearts too much upon the thingsof this world to the neglect of theirhigher duties. He explained theimportance and power that could beexercised in prayer, and exhorted thosepresent to take a wise and progressivecourse in matters pertaining to the tem-poral welfare of the people.President Wilford Woodruff.After a few prefatory observations,said he never wished to address anybody of people upon the Gospel ofChrist unless he could do so by the Spirit and inspiration of AlmightyGod; and that was his feeling this morning.Those who were at Conference Yes-terday listened to some very strongtestimonies presented by the Apostles. There was one discourse in particularto which he desired now to refer; thatof Brother Abraham H. Cannon, who alluded to the views of certain per-sons as to the great mistakes which had been made in this world, some ofthem by people calling themselvesProphets, Apostles, and Saints of God. One of these alleged mistakes was in God permitting Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit; anotherwas the mistake made in the Savior being born in a stable and cradled in a manger, instead of his coming as a conqueror, as the leaderof the inhabitants of the earth; another was that the Apostles and Prophets ceased to have revela-tions when Joseph Smith died. It was to these principles that he wished to refer.When the Prophet Joseph was called of God to lay the foundation of this Church and kingdom he was a mere boy. His first prayer to the God of heaven was offered when he was only fourteen or fifteen years of age. He had read and studied the scripturespreviously and was anxious to know what religious sect to join. An answer 
 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'MILLENIAL STARPRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid: We are highly blessed of God in being permitted to meet togetheron this the sixty-first anniversary of the organization of the Church of 
 pursued, it had a tendency to increase trouble and disturbance, instead of decreasing it. It is true, that elder Rigdon attended some of the councils that president Smith held with the Twelve and others, before his death, while giving them instruc-tions; but I heard president Smith say, that he came in without his wish or invi-tation, as he had no confidence in him. Elder Rigden and his friends would now claim, before the church and the world, that he holds the keys of the kingdom ofGod of the last dispensation, above the Twelve, the church, &c. I am ready to admit before the whole church and the world, that he does hold one key be-yond the Twelve; one that they do not hold—one that God never held, nor Jesus Christ, nor any true prophet, patriarch, or apostle; Joseph and Hyrum Smith wereutter strangers to it. And if we can judge from his own mouth, accordingto the testimony given on his trial, we would suppose that Lucifer, who madewar in heaven, was its author; and that it had been handed down untothe present day, and with it elder Rigdon has unlocked his heart, and pour-trayed before our eyes what was in it. What is it? Hear it, all ye Latter-day Saints! Listen, O Earth, and judge the fruits of this Key. He threatens toturn traitor, publish against the church in public journals, intimating that he wouldbring a mob upon the church, stir up the world against the saints, and bring dis-tress upon them, &c. Times and Seasons, vol. v. p. 650—653. This ought to be a sufficient reason for any true hearted Latter-day Saint to turn away from himwith disgust, and treat all such men and principles according to their desert,which is, to let them entirely alone; for a more despicable principle never ex-isted in heaven, earth, or hell, than to prove a traitor to our God, our cause, and our friends, and bring distress upon the innocent, and that too by turning against the very cause that a man has spent a portion of his life to build up, and declared, while in the faith, that it was true and righteous; for in all such cases there is entirely a misrepresentation of truth and facts, in order to accomplish the intendedevil, while a true statement of facts would advance the cause. This same prin-ciple was manifest in the case of Lucifer, Judas, Arnold, and many apostates in this church, who, when they could not get their own ends answered, would threaten to bring mobs upon the church, and in some instances have done so. I would ask has Joseph or Hyrum Smith ever held such a key as this, or manifested such a spirit as this? No, never; they have despised it in their hearts. President Smith seemed to be sensible that such fruit was growing in the breast of elder Rigdon; and if he had accomplished what duty appeared to present to his mind upon that subject, that branch would have been severed from the tree before his death; but through mercy it was spared until it has produced fruit which is evil in its tendency, and dangerous to the welfare of the Church and Kingdom of God.I would again ask, has elder Brigham Young ever manifested any knowledge of the key above spoken of, or any spirit or disposition to turn against the church inany time of trial or persecution from its commencement? Has he ever deserted Joseph, Hyrum, his brethren, or the cause, in one instance, since the foundation of this church? No, never, in one instance. He has always been ready to go andcome at the bidding of the Lord. He has not said so; but he has always saidcome. He has set the example and led the way, until he has traversed sea and land, at home and abroad, native and foreign countries, until he has borne off the keys of the kingdom of God in connexion with the Twelve, with honour and dig-nity, since they were committed to his charge. He has followed President Smith's footsteps closely for the last twelve years of his life, and especially the last five years; while elder Rigdon has, at the same time, been confined to the Post-office, apparently manifesting no interest in the welfare of the church and building up of the cause. The spirit of wisdom and counsel has manifested itself in the courseand deliberations of elder Young. He has not only had much experience with president Smith, but he has proved himself true and faithful in all things commit-ted to his charge, until he was called to hold the keys of the kingdom of God in all the world, in connexion with the Twelve, was the first to receive his endowment, from the hands of the prophet and patriarch, who have leaned upon him in con-nexion with the Twelve, for years, to bear off this kingdom in all the world. And they have done it with honour, labouring both day and night, making every sacrifice 
 REMARKSMade by President Wilford Woodruff, at the St. George Stake Conference, held at St. George, June 12th and 13th, 1892.REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTERI arise with a heart full of gratitude and thanksgiving to my HeavenlyFather for preserving my life until Iagain have the privilege of visiting St.George and beholding the faces of my brethren and sisters with whom I stand connected in the new and ever-lasting covenant—a covenant whichwill last not only in this world, but in the world to come.I think you are all acquainted withmy motto with regard to public speak-ing. No man, in this generation or in any other, can preach the Gospel or edify the Saints of God unless he is ledby the inspiration of the Holy Ghost; and what little I may speak to you this afternoon, I need and desire that Spirit. I hope I may have the faith and prayers of the Saints of God untothis end.I have some things upon my mind that I would like to speak of this after-noon, if I can get the spirit of them. I will say that some of the most inter-esting history of my life has been the time that I have spent here in St.George, and in the Temple of God which is built here. There is no eyethat has seen, nor ear that has heard,nor has it entered into the heart ofman to conceive, the future reward that will be given these people who dwell here and who have labored in the Temple of God. For myself, I can say that I feel under deep obligationto the people who dwell here—an obli-gation that I feel will last with me throughout all eternity. In my early days there were two things for which I desired to live. One wasthe redemption of the dead—myfather's house, my mother's house,and the progenitors who are in thespirit world, and who never heard theGospel.  I have been preserved in the flesh, as one of their descendants, tohold the keys of their salvation and redemption, the same as you have for your progenitors, whom you are calledto redeem and labor for here in the flesh. This has been a work that I have greatly desired to do for years that are past and gone, and through the blessing of the Lord and the as-sistance of my brethren and sisters who dwell in St. George, I have lived to see it accomplished to a great ex-tent, which I look upon as one of the greatest blessings God ever bestowedupon me.  So I look upon it with re-gard to all of us.The Lord has had certain purposes in gathering us together, and the redemp-tion of our dead is one of them. And when I reflect upon the work which the Latter-day Saints have been called to perform in these latterdays, I re-joice before the Lord that I have livedin this day and generation, and that I have been numbered among the Lat-ter-day Saints who have been called to perform these great and mighty works which are necessary to be performedbefore the coming of the Son of Man.The building of these Temples in thesemountains of Israel is among the mar-velous events of the day in which we live. Of course, we built Temples be-fore we came to these valleys; one in Kirtland, and one in Nauvoo. I was not at the dedication of the Temple in Kirtland; but I was presentat the dedication of the Temple inNauvoo.  The history of these Tem-ples you have before you. You know the Prophets were slain, and the Lordrequired the building of that Templeat the hands of the Saints before they were driven into the wilderness.  There was a certain revelation given that inspired in a great measure theElders of the Church of God to per-form that work. They labored withall the power they possessed, and theyaccomplished that work. They wentinto that Temple and received ordinances and endowments before they left to go into the wilderness. These Temples that we have build here stand as a monument before God, angels and men, to the faith and works of the Latter-day Saints.Brother George Q. Cannon has re-ferred to your labors in settling here.  You were called to come here by theservants of God. You left your homesto come here and you have done what was required of you in this mat-ter. You have had power to finish the Temple, and you have hadpower to go in and redeem your dead. A great many of you have done this, and I hope all of you will continue as long as you have any dead to redeem.Never cease that work while you havethe power to enter into the Temple. Ihave greatly rejoiced in my work in this Temple, and in the blessings that I have received at the hands of theLatter-day Saints here. Gold and sil-ver are no comparison to these things. I have had some thousands redeemed here. I have had baptisms, ordina-tions, washings and anointings, en-dowments and sealings for them, thesame as if they were standing in the flesh themselves. I shall go and meetthem on the other side of the veil. You will go and meet your relatives. Youwill hold the keys of their salvation to the endless ages of eternity, if you at-tend to this labor for them.There is no principle on earth that Irejoice more in than in the power that we hold as Latter-day Saints to buildthese Temples, to go into them, and to redeem our dead. It will require im-mortal bodies, immortal spirits, im-mortal revelations to enable men to comprehend the full extent of this work; they cannot comprehend it in mortality.Now, I desire to live to see the Salt Lake Temple finished. I want to bewith my brethren the Apostles, the High Priests, the Seventies, theElders and all the authorities of theChurch when that Temple is dedicated to God. We have been as long build-ing that Temple as Moses was leading the children of Israel through the wilderness to the land of promise, and I would like to see it finished.I view our position as Latter-day Saints, and all that is transpiring here,as well as our history before we camehere, as in fulfillment of the revela-tions of God.  A great many of ourfriends felt bad when we had to leaveour lovely Nauvoo to go into the wilderness. It was a great trial tothem. But had that not taken place, the Bible and the Book of Mormon andmany of the revelations in the Doc-trine and Covenants would have fallento the ground unfulfilled.  This is theplace pointed out by the finger of Godfor the people to stand in holy places while the judgments of God go forth in the earth. It is marvelous in my eyesthat I have lived to see the Temples that have been built in these moun-tains of Israel and the mighty workthat has been performed in them, con-sidering the condition in which we came here. A little handful of men,in poverty and affliction, came intothis barren desert. I brought President Young in my carriage into the valley of Salt Lake. He was sick, and he asked me toturn my carriage so that he could getsight of the valley. I did so. He cast 
 522 THE DESERET WEEKLEY.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF,in the course of a four minutes' ad-dress, bore his testimony to the remarksof President Cannon on the important subject of temple building. He pointedto the fact that as the Apostles and dis-ciples of God in former days were ever ready to lay down their lives for the Gospel's sake, so since the day of themartyrdom of the Prophet Joseph thispeople had always been willing tomake similar sacrifices in His holy name. There were but fewin the world, he said, prepared to obey the fulness of the Gospel, and that waswhy the Latter-day Saints had beenchosen and brought to these valleysfrom all nations of the earth. It wasbecause the true Gospel had been offered to them and they had received it. We had been called to go upon missions, to warn the wicked of thejudgments which were near at hand.The priesthood belonged to the celes-tial law, both for time and eternity.The Lord had made great promisesto all His faithful Saints, from the be-ginning of this work, and if we re-mained steadfast to the end thesewould all be fulfilled; and no power on earth or in hell could take from us theblessings which were in store for the righteous. We had everything to en-courage us in the good work which we had espoused; but the Lord requiredmuch at our hands, and if we united together and carried out faithfully that which He asked of us, we shouldreap our reward in due season. 
 306 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STAR.Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I feel that we ought to be thankfulbefore the Lord, that our hearts should be filled with gratitude andthanksgiving for this privilege which we now enjoy. It is true many ofour friends have been called from our midst during the past year, to theother side of the veil. The Lord has been merciful to us, as a people, inpreserving us through our history, in all the vicissitudes of life throughwhich we have been called to pass since the establishment of this Churchand kingdom. I feel that we should lift our hearts in prayer to God ourHeavenly Father for His mercies, and that He will guide and direct us bythe inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that our minds may be enlightened, andour understanding opened to comprehend His mind and will concerningHis people.I rejoice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in the revelations that comefrom heaven to both Jew and Gentile, with the various dispensations ofGod to man. Generation after generation has passed away since theearly Patriarchs stood in the flesh on the earth. The Lord has expressed,through the mouths of inspired men, from generation to generation, Hismind, His will, His work. Those revelations which were delivered thou-sands of years ago have been fulfilled to-day in our midst and among thenations of the earth. God has set His hand to establish His work, towarn the world once more, for the last time, before the coming of the Sonof man, and He has called Elders into the vineyard of the Lord, to laborwhile the day lasts; for "the night cometh, when no man can work." Wehave the fruits of this labor before us to-day, in this Tabernacle, in thevalleys of these mountains. I trust, while we are together, that ourprayers may be lifted up to the Lord, that our hearts may be united; thatwhile our brethren, the Apostles and Elders, stand before us and giveunto us their testimony of the word of God, we may have a full share ofHis blessing.I do not think I ought to occupy much more of your time this morning;but I feel thankful that I am still with you, and able to meet on thisoccasion with so many of the Latter-day Saints who have entered into cov-enant with the Lord, and upon whose shoulders He has laid the holyPriesthood, to administer, to warn the world, to devote their time andattention to the ordinances of the House of God, both for the living andthe dead. I feel myself that of all people under heaven that have everlived, the Latter-day Saints have the greatest cause to rejoice that theylive in the day and generation when the Lord has set His hand to gathertogether His people, to establish both Jerusalem and Zion, and to fulfilHis promises made to Father Abraham and the ancient Patriarchs andProphets.The Jews have been a hiss and a bye-word among the Gentiles since thedeath of the Savior, eighteen hundred years ago. Their redemption is atthe door to-day; it has been proclaimed by inspired men to their owntribe. It is left on record that the Jews will return home, that Jerusalemwill be rebuilt; their temple will be established, and all those great andmighty promises given by inspiration and revelation will come to pass.I pray God our heavenly Father to bestow His blessing upon us, that it 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFwas the first speaker. The following is a brief synopsis of his discourse:He commenced by stating, that he desired the faith and prayers of the Saints, because nobody could occupy the position he now had profitably tothe hearers, without being guided bythe Holy Spirit. There were a fewthoughts on his mind which he wouldendeavor to lay before the Conference. In the first place he would bear hiswitness to the truth of the Gospel ofJesus Christ as revealed in these latterdays, and he did so fully aware of thefact that he was responsible before theAlmighty as to the testimony he gave.The Saints were witnesses before theworld and accountable for what theysaid, but the world would be responsi-ble if it rejected the testimony. Thespeaker knew that this work was ofGod and had been established throughHis power. During almost sixty yearshe had been connected with theChurch and held the holy Priesthoodand during that time he had traveledmuch abroad and at home la-boring for the spread of the Gospel.He had seen numerous manifestationsof the power of the Almighty. Thegifts formerly possessed by the Saintshe had seen exercised in this Church.The Holy Spirit was given to thosewho complied with the requirementsof the Gospel. Hence the speakerknew that Joseph was a Prophet ofGod and that this Church was thework of God.Concerning revelation, President Woodruff said the Saints were notwithout that divine gift. There weremany men and women in these valleyswho were filled with inspiration, andthe Apostles, when they spoke to thepeople by the Holy Spirit, were revela-tors. The kingdom of God could not exist without revelations. We might, however, feel that we wanted more revelations than we had, to better un-derstand our position and to accom-plish the work we were called to perform. From the timeof Adam to the present hourno one could be found who everpreached and administered in theordinances of the Gospel without hav-ing the holy Priesthood. All thatMoses and his successors did, and eventhe work done by our Savior, was doneby the power of the Priesthood. Thisthe speaker illustrated by reference tothe life and death of our Savior.Christ came in the meridian of timeto the Jewish nation, but that peopledid not receive Him. He lived long enough to teach the gospel and organ-ize His church. But after this workwas done, He gave Himself up todeath and was crucified by His en-emies, for whom He prayed, "Father,forgive them, for they know not whatthey do." He had previously chosentwelve Apostles to be His witnesses.These were taken not from the prom-inent men of the nation but from thelowly and humble, who were willingto be taught by Him and to do His will. Something similar had taken placein our age. The Lord had estab-lished a dispensation. This was notfor one nation only, but for both Gentiles and Jews.The dispensation in which the firstApostles lived was not permanent. Afterthe time of the Apostles the Priest-hood was taken away, the Church wasled into the wilderness, where she re-mained until the time of the restora-tion. But the last dispensation was different from the previous ones. Itwas established never to be over-thrown, in fulfillment of propheciesgiven in previous dispensations. Inthe sacred Scriptures the history of ourwork is already written. There neverwas a more important or a greaterdispensation.Joseph Smith was an illiterate youngman, but he was called upon to performthis great work, and he had revelationsgiven to him that were greater thanany we read of given to other prophets. The speaker had traveled with him forthousands of miles, and had been aneye witness to the mighty works he hadperformed, and he could therefore notdoubt his divine mission. He had seenhim, by the power of God, heal the sickand do other marvelous works, and theSpirit of God rested upon him until hismartyrdom. The Church had there-fore been organized by the power of God, with all the gifts and graces that belonged thereto. A great foundation had been laid. The Saints were here,gathered by the power of God. Ourhistory was known to the world, and it was comforting to know that the work that we have to do had already been foreshadowed thousands of years ago by holy prophets. Even the place in which we now dwell wasthe one where God wants us to be. This is the place where the city andtemple of God should be built. What God has foretold has come true.Concerning the duties of the Saints,the speaker said it now was incumbentupon us to go forth and warn the in-habitants of the earth of the judgmentsto come. For this we were reserved in the spirit world and had now come forth upon the earth in these days. There was a great responsibility rest-ing upon us in regard to this. The Prophets Joseph and Hyrum laid the foundation of this work and received the crown of martyrs. But on us the responsibility rested to continue the work and warn the world.Speaking of the revelation relating to the redemption of the dead, PresidentWoodruff said this was a most comforting doctrine. Through it we were taught how the principles of salvation could be extended beyond the veil and reachour progenitors. He wished that all the Saints might have their understand-ings opened to this great truth. It wasa matter to be thankful for that we hadalready been able to build three temples in this Territory, and we shouldbe diligent in completing the one nowbeing erected in this city. Our dead did not look to the sectarian world but to us for the performance of the ordinances connected with their salva-tion. A vast host of enemies werearrayed against this work, but the Lord would sustain us and hold His hand over us until the work was doneand all His plans and purposes accom-plished.The speaker then took up the subject of home industries, and said that he would endorse the remarks made on this subject during the Conference. The Saints were here to build up Zion.With regard to the future, President Woodruff said, the rising generationwould stand up and carry this work onward by the power of God. The right element was there. Our sons, asa general rule, would not forsake their God nor their fathers and mothers. Some of them might go astray, but there would be found among them those who could by the power of God carry out this work. In his early life the speaker had often read about Prophets and Apostles and other holy men and he had wished to live to see one, and when he heard the Gospel he felt that his desire had been granted. He would therefore admonish the young to give themselves up to the work of God.He felt to bless the Saints with all his heart. He would bless his brethrenof the Apostles and say there was unity among them. He rejoiced in contemplating the work of God in these last days. It was such a work as was never heard of before.The speaker closed his remarks by stating that he was glad that he was alive yet. He knew he was sustained by the prayers of tens of thousands of righteous men and women. He wished that the Saints might be faith-ful and true and kind to each otherand that God's blessings might rest abundantly upon them. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFSaid: I have a request I wish to maketo this assembly of latter-day Saints,as all may not be here this afternoon,who are here now. There are manyof you from a distance as well as manywho dwell here in the city. You areexpecting to go into the temple to at-tend its dedication. I have a desire in my heart that every one of you, thenight before you go into the Temple,before retiring to rest, willgo by yourselves, in secret prayer. Offer up your prayers to the Lord, and pray that your sins may not only be forgiven, but that you may all have the spirit of God and the testi-mony of the Lord Jesus Christ; thatthe Spirit of God may be with those who who assemble in that Temple.The inhabitants of the earth do notrealize the effect and benefit of prayer.The Lord hears and answers the pray-ers of men, women and children.Prayer has more power, a great deal,to bring down the blessings of God,than almost any other thing.I have the desire for the Saints to do this, for I wish to see those who go into the Temple go in with pure hearts, and that the Spirit of God maybe with them, that they may enjoy themselves, that they may all feelthe influence of that power while at the dedication of the Temple.I pray God to give you all an an-swer to your prayers, and to give youthe Holy spirit to assist you while at the dedication and services of the dedi-cation. Amen. 
 his eyes over the valley and looked forsome little time. When he got through he said, "Brother Woodruff, drive on. Here is our home.  This is the place God has pointed out for us to plant our feet. I have seen this place before." He began to recover rightfrom that time. Well, we camped there, and we visited around some. President Young said, "Now, breth-ren, go where you please; go north, gosouth; go to any part of the country,and when you come back you will say this is the place." Men came fromCalifornia, among them Brannan, whourged us strongly to go to California,saying that it was such a fine country, and we were there in a barren desert.But President Young said, "This isour home. Here we shall build theTemple of God and the city of our God." I think this has been plainly fulfilled. The inspiration of the Lordwas with President Young all throughhis life, and the result of it is manifest. I traveled with him in the first settle-ing of this country. Where is there a man that has the spirit of inspiration but can see the hand of Godin these things? We have had our day of affliction, of perse-cution and poverty. All earthand hell, if I may be allowed to usesuch an expression, were combined against the Prophet Joseph Smith, from the time this Church was organ-ized until he was slain in the flesh, and the same spirit continued throughthe life of Brother Brigham Young.  But we came to these valleys of the mountains, and from the day that we planted our tents in Salt Lake City there has been a degree of prosperityresting upon this people, and it has in-creased year by year until to[d]ay. TheLord has been with us. Blessings have been poured out upon the Latter-day Saints, and we have had plenty of food and raiment. But I hope that none of us will get proud and lifted up in our hearts so that we shall forgetthe hand that has given unto us these things.This is a dispensation in which the Lord has set His hand to establish HisChurch, to build up His Zion, to warn the world, to prepare the nations forthe judgments of God, and to prepareHis people to be united together as the bride, the Lamb's wife. My faithcentres in the promises of God.There is no power on the face of this earth that can break this Church. Why? Because God holds it in His hands.  He is the Author of it, and He haspromised, through the mouths of scores and scores of prophets, that it shallstand. It is in fulfilment of these promises that you are blessed here with a Temple and have power to entertherin to attend to the ordinances of the House of the Lord. And when you reflect upon these matters, and see how far these things have been fulfilled, can you not have faith to believe that the Lord will carry it out to the end? I certainly have. I know it is the work of God. And the Lord has chosen this people, out of the whole human family, to stand in the flesh, keep the com-mandments of God, and go forth to warn the world by the proclamation ofthe Gospel of Jesus Christ that they may know and understand the judg-ments of God which await them. TheLatter-day Saints have been workingat this for sixty years, and we have notgot through with it yet. Behold whatis taking place in the earth today! It really seems as if the day had almost dawned upon us when there is no otherplace of safety for the human familythan the land of Zion. Three elements—fire, water and wind—seem to have been chosen to go forth on a mission to visit the nations. Cities are burned up, and floods and whirlwinds aweep awaytowns and villages and the inhabitants are destroyed. Are not these thingsall proclaimed by the revelations of Gou [God]? They are, and they will come topass.Brethren and sisters, this is the mis-sion given to us in the last days. And that man is a very foolish man who will divide upon any principle againstthe Gospel of Jesus Christ. I havehad more sorrow over one apostate in this Church than I have in attendingthe funerals of all the patriarchs andprophets and Latter-day Saints that I ever followed to the grave; because whenI see men and women die who have been faithful I know they have gained a victory.  That is the way I feel to-day. We must work together for the welfare of Zion.I am glad to see you and to spend afew days again in St. George. I want to do what good I can. I expect weshall all meet the other side of theveil with those who have gone before,and have joy and rejoicing in the Gospel of Christ. We should be faithful to the Lord, and we should not forgetour prayers. Our sons and daughters should be instructed in these things, and we should labor for their welfare. What joy and consolation it gives a father or a mother to have good boysand girls, who keep the word of wis-dom, attend to Sabbath schools, re-member their prayers, and follow inthe footsteps of their fathers; while it gives us sorrow when we have sons and daughters that turn away from this.  But I have hope and faith that thesons of Zion will rise up and magnifytheir callings. I do not believe that they will disappoint our HeavenlyFather.Seeing a portion of our gallery oc-cupied by a quite a number of our La-manite brethren and sisters, I feel dis-posed to make a few remarks.The first time I ever saw JosephSmith was in April, 1834. I met himin the streets of Kirtland. He invitedme to his house. I stopped with himwhile preparing to go up to Zion inZion's camp. On Sunday he called aPriesthood meeting. They all gather-ed in a little cabin. There I firstheard Joseph Smith speak pub-licly, also Hyrum Smith, OliverCowdery, Brigham Young, Heber C.Kimball, Parley and Orson Pratt, andWilliam E. McLellin. The Prophetcalled upon the Elders to bear testi-mony of the Gospel of Christ, andthey arose one after another and borea short testimony. Then BrotherJoseph arose and said: "Brethren, Iam very much edified and interestedin listening to your testimony. But Iwant to tell you that you know nomore concerning the result of thiswork and what lies before you asthe Elders of Israel and before thispeople, than a parcel of little children."I expect they were all a little startledby it. He told them this workwould fill the whole earth, andthat all nations would have tohear the proclamation of theGospel. He further said: "This workwill fill the Rocky Mountains withtens of thousands of Latter-day Saints,and there will be joined with them theLamanites who dwell in those moun-tains, who will receive the Gospel ofChrist at the mouth of Elders ofIsrael, and they will be united withthe Church and Kingdom of God, andbring forth much good." I littlethought, when I listened to thosewords, that I should ever live to seethe fulfilment of these words of theProphet. I little thought that I shouldever visit the Rocky Mountains, or eversee the Lamanites of whom he thenwas speaking. These men before metoday bring to my mind sayings of theProphet. His mind expanded on thatoccasion and he had a good deal tosay with regard to the progress of thiswork, what the Elders of Israel wouldhave to pass through, and the work thatGod would require at their hands inthe redemption of the Lamanites andthe honest and meek throughout theworld, and in the building up of theZion of God on the earth. But I havelived to see these days. I have livedto see the Lamanites in these moun-tains. I have visited a great manyof them—tbe [the] Zunis, Lagunas, Moquis,Navajoes, Apaches, and a greatmany of these Indian tribes. I havepreached the Gospel to them, in con-nection with my brethren, through in-terpreters. I have spent many inter-esting days with these Lamanites inthe mountains of Israel. I spent threedays in the wilderness in Arizona withPetone, the great war chief of the na-tion. I preached the Gospel to him. He called his tribe together, stood uponhis feet some two hours or more, andtold his tribe all that we had said tohim. This tribe was looked upon as avery dangerous one in the midst of thenation, and this Petone had engaged ina great deal of warfare.I rejoice that I have lived to see thisday; that I have lived to see theRocky Mountains; that I have beengathered with the Latter-day Saintshere. A great deal has been doue [done] bythis people, but much more will haveto be done. We tell sometimes aboutdreams. I had a dream one nightabout our Temple in Salt Lake. Ithought the Temple was dedicated andorganized, and we as the Elders of Israelwere laboring there for the redemption ofour dead, and suddenly there was a dooropened in the west, and an Indianchief came into the Temple, leading avast host of his tribe, and took posses-sion of the Temple, and I thought theyperformed more work in one hour thanwe could do in a day. This made astrong impression oo [on] my mind. I amsatisfied that although we have donea little for the Lamanites, we have gotto do a great deal more. I believe Isealed the first Lamanitish man andwoman together that ever were sealedin this dispensation. It was in theEndowment House, and quite a num-ber of brethren and sisters were pre-sent. The man's name was Laman.I believe the day will come when theseLamanites, with the dark skin thatrests upon them, will enter into theseTemples of the Lord in these moun-tains and do a great deal of work.They will come to an understanding ofthe redemption of the dead.

XLVIII.THE RIGHTS OF THE PRIESTHOOD.Discourse delivered at the Utah StakeConference, Provo, Sunday After-noon, January 14, 1894, by PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.] -I am pleased to meet with so many of the Saints of God.  I have listened to the remarks that have been made at this conference upon the Priesthood, and have been very much interestedand edified.  I do not know of any sub-ject in the Church of more importanceto the inhabitants of the earth and toourselves than the Holy Priesthood.  Inlistening to Brother F. M. Lyman's re-marks concerning the Lesser PriesthoodI had many thoughts and reflections.  Some of them I feel to express to the Latter-day Saints.  There is one prin-ciple connected with the Priesthoodthat I want all Israel to understand, andthat is this:  it makes no difference whatportion of the Priesthood a man holds,if he holds any at all, he has rights.  Whether he be a Deacon or whether hebe an Apostle, the Priesthood held byhim has rights, on earth and in theheavens.  In this connection let me read a paragraph or two from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants:Behold, there are many called, but few arechosen.  And why are they not chosen?Because their hearts are set so much  uponthe things of this world, and aspire to thehonors of men, that they do not learn this onelesson--That the rights of the Priesthood are insepar-ably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controllednor handled only upon the principles of right-eousness.That is the principle that we shouldunderstand.  Sixty years ago, the 30thof last December, I heard the first ser-mon I ever heard in this Church. The next day I was baptized.  There werevery few branches of the Church in thecountry at that time.  I was ordained a Teacher.  My mission immediately com-menced.  I traveled the next spring a thousand miles with the Prophet Josephin Zion's Camp.  I went through thatwhole mission as a Teacher. Arrivedin Missouri, several of us stopped at Lyman Wight's, where we held aTeachers' meeting.  I remained in thatoffice until at the conference I was or-dained a Priest.  I never was ordaineda Deacon.  I was sorry I was not; for Ihad a great desire to fill that office.However, I was not blessed with it. After I was ordained a Priest I was sent by the father of Brother Partridge hereon a mission to the southern country.  That was in the fall of 1834.  I had a companion with me, and we started outwithout purse and scrip.  I traveledalone a good many miles and preachedthe Gospel, and I baptized a numberthat I could not confirm in the Church, because I was only a Priest. The firsttime I ever met with Brother A. O. Smoot, was upon that mission.  I trav-eled some time preaching the Gospel before I was ordained an Elder.  I was ordained an Elder under the hands of Warren Parrish.  Afterwards, by order of the Prophet Joseph, I was ordained aSeventy by David Patten, who was mar-tyred in Missouri for the word of Godand testimony of Jesus Christ.  In 1837 -- the same year that Brother Kimballwent to England and opened the mis-sion there--I got permission from thePresidency in Kirtland to go to Fox Is-lands, being impressed by the Spirit to go there.  While I was there I was called by revelation, with several others,to fill the places of those who werefallen of the Twelve Apostles.  I havebeen some fifty-four years a member of the Twelve Apostles.  I have traveled with that and other quorums now forsixty years; and I want to say to this assembly that I was just as much sus-tained by the power of God while hold-ing the office of a Teacher, and especi-ally while officiating in the vineyard asa Priest, as I ever was as an Apostle.  There is no difference in this so long aswe do our duty.When a man holding any portion ofthat Priesthood goes before God, the heavens are bound to hear him, if hemagnifies his Priesthood; and certainlyit is our duty to go before the Lord andask Him for what we want, and whenwe do that in faith, God hears and an-swers us.  God has heard the prayers of the men who have borne the Priest-hood from the day that Joseph Smith received the plates from the hands ofMoroni, and He has fulfilled the prophe-cies contained in the Bible and the Book of Mormon.  The Church has never fallen, notwithstanding her afflic-tions, her persecutions, her drivings, and her martyrdoms; but God has sus-tained it.  When the Lord bestows giftsupon the children of men in connectionwith the Priesthood, those who receive those gifts are responsible for the use they make of them.  We are respons-ible for the use we make of the HolyPriesthood which has been placed uponus. Whatever is necessary for us to receive and enjoy, it is our duty to ask the Lord for.  We should go beforeHim in secret places and make our wants known, that our prayers may beheard and answered upon our heads. Herein lies our strength.  Our trust isin God, and not in man.  He has com-mitted this work into the hands of HisSon, Jesus Christ, the Savior of theworld, and this mission has been uponHim from the days of father Adam.  He was appointed as the great sacrificefrom before the foundation of the world. He came in the meridian of time anddied for the redemption of man.  Weare engaged in the last dispensation.  We are called upon to build up this Church and this Zion. And we can only do it by the power of the Holy Priesthood.  No man has authority fromGod to administer to the children of men the ordinances of life and salvationonly by the power of the Holy Priest-hood.  The power of that Priesthood iswith the Latter-day Saints.  When ourbrethren go out to the world--I do not care whether they are Priests, or Elders, or Seventies, or Apostles -- and they offer to the Gentiles the Gospel of Christ, the power of God is with them, as long as they magnify their calling.  That power bears record to every honest man and woman concerning the truth of the message which these men bear. By that power men and women have been pricked in their hearts and the Spirit of God has borne testimony to them.  You have found this to be true;so have I.  Without this power of the Priesthood, these effects cannot bemanifested to men in the flesh.  I hopethat all Israel will understand this prin-ciple.  You have not got to wait till you are an Elder, or a High Priest, oran Apostle, before God can hear yourprayers.  I know the Lord preserved my life when I held the office of a Priest.In one instance a man who sought mylife, without any action on my part fell dead at my feet, as though he was struck with a thunderbolt from heaven, and I attended his funeral the next day.I had many blessings as a Priest, and had the spirit and power of God in thatoffice.Every man in every office ought to magnify his Priesthood.  The Deaconought to do so.  I was very muchpleased once in seeing a number of Deacons magnify their calling, downhere at Nephi.  They went through the city and chopped every piece of woodwhich every widow in that town had.  Brother Geo. Teasdale, the President of the Stake, had three or four cords of cedar wood in his lot, and he went homeone night and found that it had dis-appeared.  He wondered what was thematter; but when he came to look around he found it all chopped up in hiswood-house.  They magnified their call-ing splendidly there.Today we are, in some respects, in peculiar circumstances.  We shouldtrust in the Lord and do what is right. I know the Priesthood is given for thesalvation of men and for the adminis-tration of ordinances both for the living

WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER ]-I suppose it is expected that while I live and am able to meet with the SaintsI shall do a little talking and take my turn with the rest.  I feel disposed to speak a few moments on this occasion, if I can get the spirit of it.I listened to two very interesting dis-courses here this forenoon by two of the Apostles.  I was very much edified with both of them, because they were true. When the Lord called Joseph Smith as a prophet, seer and revelator to organ-ize this church, he organized it for all time and for all purposes necessary toprepare the inhabitants of the earth forthe coming of the Son of Man. I think sometimes that even the Saints of God almost forget their position, their calling, their responsibility, and what God re-quires at their hands. Brother Abraham H. Cannon referred this morning to the Mutual Improvement Associations and conveyed the idea that there was but a small percentage of our young men in this Stake of Zion who attended these associations. Now, I want to say a fewwords upon that subject. I want to have our young men open their ears,their eyes, their hearts, their spirits, and look about themselves and understand where they are and what their positionis. The God of heaven has set His hand to build up Zion; has set His hand to purify the earth, and to establish a people on the earth to be prepared for the coming of the Son of Man. The Latter-day Saints who dwell in these mountains have this responsibility rest-ing upon them; and no man who has had the privileges of this Gospel, and who has parents in the Church of God, can throw off this responsibility. It is the desire of the authorities of the Church and of the parents of these young men and maidens who dwell here, that they should rise up and magnify their calling and fulfill their position in the earth. There is no other people under heaven that enjoy the privileges that the Latter-day Saints have, and that our sons and daughters have in our or-ganizations in the midst of Israel. I am anxious that all Latter-day Saints, from the Presidency of the Church down to the last member, should understand clearly in their minds that the God of heaven is not trifling with this people, is not trifling with this generation, nor with the inhabitants of the earth. All that He has said, all that He has in-spired His prophets to prophesy, from father Adam down to our day, concern-ing this generation and the inhabitants of the earth, will have its fulfillment in the earth. No power can stay the hand of God in this thing. Blessed is that man who has got a son that is ready and willing to go forth to the nations of the earth and warn the world, to pre-pare them for the judgments which await the world, and to save the souls ofmen. There is nothing more pleasing to me than to see our sons willing to go upon missions, either at home or abroad; to see them laying the foundation in their youth and early manhood to be-come useful in the kingdom of God and useful in the world at large. Our Heavenly Father requires this mission and this warning at the hands of these Apostles, and the Presidents of the Church, and the Elders of Israel, and the Latter-day Saints. We are all held responsible for the course we pursue in these things. I have a great anxiety myself that none of our sons will forsake the kingdom of God and turn to those things that are not profitable, sacrificing the Gospel and the privileges that lie be-fore us for the sake of the pleasures of this world. Our sons should not do that. Our daughters should encourage their brothers to magnify their calling and to do their duty in their day and time. Our Sabbath schools and our Mutual Im-provement associations should be at-tended by all the young men in Israel. The Sabbath schools have a very good attendance. I think there are nearly one hundred thousand enrolled in the Sabbath schools in these mountains of Israel. I hope that we may pursue that course ourselves wherein we may be justified before the Lord.The hand of God has been manifest in this Church from its organization un-til today. Sixty-six years have past and gone since the Prophet Joseph organized the Church, and hundreds and thousands have been inspired by the spirit and power of God to embrace the Gospel. This spirit was upon me in my boyhood. The first sermon I heard an Elder in Israel preach I believed, and went forth and was baptized. And from that day to this, I will say before God,angels and men, in all that I have passed through in this Church, there never has been one moment that I have had any doubt in my mind with regard to the work of God. I have been in the midst of leading men, some of whom have apostatized and turned away; but I have never seen anything that ever tempted me to turn to the right or left from obey-ing the commandments of God or be-lieving in the revelations of God.We as Latter-day Saints believe the Bible; but are we looking for the fulfill-ment of the Bible? Read the revela-tions of St. John, and read what is com-ing to pass in the last days before the coming of the Son of Man. Thesethings are beginning to manifest them-selves in the earth, and they will con-tinue until the scene is wound up and prophecy is fulfilled. I will take the liberty of saying today that what you have seen going abroad of late in our own nation and among the inhabitants of the earth, there is a meaning to it. Does anybody understand it? Does any-body comprehend why all of a sudden, so to speak, these judgments are mani-fest, laying waste our cities and towns? This is only the beginning of these judgments that are going to awake the world; and they will continue until the rivers and the seas turn to blood and to gall, and many of the inhabitants of the earth will die because of these things. They have all been portrayed, and they will be fulfilled.My brethren and sisters, this work is upon us. There is no getting away from it if we expect to gain salvation and exaltation. It was laid upon Joseph Smith and those who have followed him in the Priesthood. We as Elders of Israel have gone abroad to the nations in our day and time, and we know for ourselves, and not for another, that the gifts and graces follow the Elders of Israel in our day as they have in the days of Christ and the Apostles. You all know this. I do not suppose that there is a man among us who is not acquaint-ed with these things. Those gifts and graces have always followed the Priest-hood and the administration of the Elders. The sick have been healed, devils have been cast out, the blind have been made to see, the deaf have heard, the Gospel of Christ has been manifest in all its power from the beginning of the Church. If this were not the work of God, these things would not have been manifested as they have been. I am not telling you anything that is new to you. These things belong to the Gospel of Christ. They were with the Apostles of Christ in His day. There is one thing I have sometimes marveled at—that Jesus Christ, the Son of the Liv-ing God, the Savior of the world, with the great and mighty work which rested upon His shoulders, only dwelt in the flesh three years and a half after he entered into the ministry. Joseph Smith, who was called to lay the foundation of this work, spent fourteen years in the flesh after the Church was organized. John the revelator, when speaking of the events that were to take place in the last days, says:And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.Truth and Liberty.No. 21. SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, NOVEMBER 7, 1896. VOL. LIIIDISCOURSEDelivered at the Weber Stake Confer-ence, Ogden, Monday, Octo-ber 19th, 1896, by PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-I am pleased to meet with so many ofour friends this morning, and I feeldesirious to talk to you upon a principlethat I very seldom dwell upon beforethe congregations of the Saints. I have had my mind somewhat exercised of late on various things, perhaps for purposes known to the Lord better thanmyself, though they are principles weare all more or less acquainted with.One of the Apostles said to me yearsago, "Brother Woodruff, I have prayed for a long time for the Lord to send me the administration of an angel. I have had a great desire for this, but I have never had my prayers answered." I said to him that if he were to pray athousand years to the God of Israel for that gift, it would not be granted, unless the Lord had a motive in sending an angel to him. I told him that the Lord never did nor never will send an angel to anybody merely to gratify the desireof the individual to see an angel[.] Ifthe Lord sends an angel to anyone, Hesends him to perform a work that can-not be performed only by the adminis-tration of an angel. I said to him that those were my views. The Lord had sent angels to men from the creation of the world, at different times, but alwayswith a message or with something to perform that could not be performedwithout. I rehearsed to him differenttimes when angels appeared to men. Ofcourse, I referred to the angel visiting Joseph Smith. The Revelator John said that in the last days an angel would fly in the midst of heaven, having theeverlasting Gospel to preach to themthat dwell on the earth. The reason it required an angel to do this work was, the Gospel was not on the earth. The Gospel and the Priesthood had beentaken from among men. Hence Godhad to restore it again.Now, I have always said, and I wantto say it to you, that the Holy Ghost iswhat every Saint of God needs. It is far more important that a man shouldhave that gift than he should have the ministration of an angel, unless it isnecessary for an angel to teach him something that he has not been taught.I am going to refer to some of my own experiences with regard to the ministration of angels and the opera-tions of the Holy Ghost. I have never prayed for the visitation of an angel,but I have had the ministrations ofangels several times in my life.One visitation I received in Kentucky,at the house of A. O. Smoot's mother,while on my first mission. I went through Jackson county into ArkansasTerritory, and from Little Rock wadedthe Mississippi swamp 180 miles to getacross into Tennessee. I arrived in Henry county, Tennessee, on the west,at the same time that David Patten and Warren Parrish landed in that region on the north. We met and laboredtogether for awhile and built up somechurches there. I then held the office of a Priest. I traveled thousands of milesand preached the Gospel as a Priest, and, as I have said to congregations before, the Lord sustained me and made manifest His power in the defenseof my life as much while I held that office as He has done while I have heldthe office of an Apostle. The Lord sus-tains any man that holds a portion of thePriesthood, whether he is a Priest, an Elder, a Seventy, or an Apostle, if hemagnifies his calling and does his duty.I will give you an instance of the Lord's protecting care over me while I was a Priest. I had this experience while in Arkansas with my companion,who was an Elder. There was a manin that country who with his wife andfive sons had been in Jackson county.His wife died there. The old gentlemanwas in the faith apparently when he leftthere. He was driven out, the same as the rest of the Saints were, and some o[f]his sons were whipped with hickory gads in the persecution there. I knew hewas in this Arkansas country, and I feltanxious to go and see him, as he was the only Latter-day Saint that we knew anything about in that region. Thenight before I got there I had a peculiar dream. I dreamed that an angel ap-peared to us and pointed out a certain path that we must follow, and that theb[l]essings of God would attend us in following that path. As we went alongthis path we came to a log cabin with a wall on each side ten or fifteen feet high.This road led right through that build-ing. When I went to the door and opened it, it was full of large serpents. My companion said he was not goinginto that room for anybody or anything."Well," says I, "I am, or I'll die trying.The Lord told us to follow that path, and I am going to walk in it, unless Iam stopped by some power that I knownot of" I stepped into the door.These serpents all arose up ready tojump on me, and there was a very largeone in the middle of the floor that madea pass at me. It appeared to me as though I would be destroyed, but whenthe serpent reached near to me it dropped dead; in fact, they all dropped dead, and they turned black and burst open, after which they took fire and burned up, and both of us went throughsafely. The morning after, we arrivedat this man's house. His name wasAkeman. It was Sunday morning, andwe went into the house. Mr. Akeman and his daughter were at breakfast.His sons were settled in cabins aroundhim. We sat down, but thereseemed to be a peculiar spirit inthe place. I finally stepped up to the mantlepiece, on which I saw a Book of Mormon. I picked it up, and said, "Brother Akeman, you've got a verygood book here." He said, "It's a book that came from hell." I then began to understand a little of what lay beforeus. He had apostatized. He cursedeverything and everybody—JosephSmith, Lyman Wight, the Apostles anda good many others whom he named.He was very angry. I inquired abouthis sons. He said they were settled around him there. Well, we took up our valises and left. I looked up oneof his sons—the youngest, I believe,and the only one that was in the faith, and he was like a drowning man; but by praying with him we got the Spirit of the Lord in him, and we had a prettygood time with him. We told him ofour experience at his father's, and I saidwe were desirous to have some meet-ings there if we could. He said he didnot know; his father had apostatizedand was at war against everything thatwas Mormon. He told us, however, where an old gentleman lived close by to whom he had loaned the Book of Mormon. He was an aged man and his wife was an aged woman. Their namewas Hubbard. We went to see them andthey were very glad to receive us. In the morning my companion said he wasgoing to leave the place. Of course, hewas an Elder, and I was only a Priest, and we generally suppose that the lessershould obey the greater; but I said to him, calling him by name, "You are not going to leave here, nor I either; we shall both of us stay here till I see thefulfillment of my dream. It is here, andI am going to stay and see it, and you will, too." It is not natural for me to take a stand of that kind, but I felt ledto do it upon that occasion. We stoppedthere three weeks, and cleared land for father Hubbard, while he fed and housed us. Three times while we were thereI was warned of the Lord to go and warn this Mr. Akeman. The last warn-ing I received from the Lord was on Saturday night of the third week. I went up to his house which was aboutthree quarters of a mile distant, and when I got there his daughter stood in the doorway. I walked in and saluted him. He was walking the room, butdid not say anything to me. I told him the Lord had sent me to pay him a visit. 
 will have wisdom given unto them. They will have light and truth given unto them, and the spirit of their forefathers will be manifest unto them. I am thankful that I am able to see these Lamanites here. The Prophetof God saw what would come to pass,and he told the truth. As Elders ofIsrael we have fulfilled, in a measure, many of the Prophet's sayings in rela-tion to these things. We have traveledto the nations of the earth, as he said we should do, and this Gospel has gone to a great many nations. More doors will be opened in the due time of the Lord. When these judgments of God are manifest in the earth, thehonest in heart and meek of the earth will have their eyes opened and they will be very glad to flee to Zion. I look back to the days when we first went to New England to preach the Gospel, and when there were Saints in almost every city there. And when we went to England in 1840 we baptized over seven thousand in one year. So it has been more or less through the world. There have been people prepared to receive this Gospel and to work for the Lord. And we are only in the begin-ning of this work, as it were. The day will come when many will seek a place of safety, that they may stand in holy places while the judgments of the Lord pass. Our young men will rise up in those days. They will remember their prayers before the Lord. Their minds will be opened to see the work that lies before them. A great deal has yet to be done, although the Lord will makeshort His work in the earth, lest noflesh be saved. I am thankful that there is as much done as there is;thankful that we have had the privi-lege of opening our mouths among the nations of the earth and the islands of the sea, and preaching the Gospel. What greater work can any man be engaged in than the saving of thesouls of men? No matter how poorwe may be, it is a glorious work and a blessing to any man. When I lookupon the Apostles and the Elders and bring to my mind the labors they haveperformed, the miles they have trav-eled, the souls of men they have brought into the Gospel, I feel that it isa work worthy of all acceptation of angels or men.I pray the Lord that we may have power to convert these Lamanites tothe Gospel of Christ. It is true it has been a hard work up to the present to get their minds open to comprehend these things, though many of them have been baptized; yet a great work is to be done among them. Our brethren should remember this, and treat them kindly. Let us do what wecan to make them happy and comfort-able while we are with them. It isour duty to do what we can for theirbenefit, and to give them the Gospel. God bless you and guide you in the ways of life. Amen. 
 Salt Lake City  Sept 10th 1887Trustees and Trust of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Dear Breathern: Allowme at this time to call to yourminds a fact that might neverenter there otherwise. In the earlydays of Utah the Church wasin very straight circumstancesand mutch had to be done byits members. Those who wereselfish or not able to live anyother way had a living fromthe Tithing oOffice; But there aresome who worked hard foryears and got no remuneration,who had their heart so in thework that they even sold theirhomes to get bread for 
 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STAR. 307may continue to rest upon His Saints who have entered into covenantwith Him; that we may recognize our responsibility and magnify ourcalling day by day, so that when we pass to the other side of the veil wemay be justified in His sight. This is my prayer and desire for JesusChrist's sake, Amen.

 2  THE DESERET WEEKLY.Yes, the hour of God's judgment is come. The Lord raised up JosephSmith through the loins of Abraham,Isaac and Jacob, and Joseph and Eph-raim, and He gave unto him this work;He put into his hands the Book of Mor-mon, which was hid up in the Hill Cumorah by ancient Moroni. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] All thepowers of earth and hell apparently sought to destroy him while he held that,so that it should not be translated; butGod delivered him, and he lived to trans-late the work into the English language, and since then it has been translated in-to a great many languages and publish-ed to the world. The Lord also gave unto him this Book of Doctrine and Covenants, containing the grandest re-velations that God ever gave to man. He lived to reveal that to the Church ofGod and to the world as well as to tran-slate the Book of Mormon. He accom-plished this great work in a short time,and then laid down his life for the wordof God and testimony of Jesus Christ. He has gone home with the rest of themartyrs, awaiting the coming of the Sonof Man and beholding the judgments ofGod laying waste the inhabitants of theearth, in fulfillment of revelation andprophecy.Brethren and sisters, my feelings arethat we ought to improve our time, anddo what we can, no matter what the world says of us or what is reported about us. We have our duties to per-form, and we have got to build up thekingdom of God. This is our duty while we dwell in the flesh, and whenwe get through we will lie down and sleep in death, and go into the spiritworld and, if we are righteous, minglewith those faithful ones who have gonebefore us and prepare for the coming ofthe Son of Man. My prayer to God is that we may have power to magnify ourcalling, as Apostles of the Lord JesusChrist and Elders of Israel, and to do our duty. We have but one life here. Some of us may live longer than others; but it matters not whether this life be long or short, we will be held respon-sible for what we do while we dwell inthe flesh. I pray God to inspire the hearts of our sons and daughters, that they may comprehend the importance and the worth of the salvation of the souls of men, and of attending these Sabbath schools and these improvementmeetings, and that we all may make a right use of these gifts and graces whilethey are in our hands. I feel to ask Godfor His blessings to rest upon us as the Presidency of the Church, the Twelve Apostles, and all the quorums of the Priesthood. I feel to ask God to blessour sisters who are laboring in the Pri-mary Associations, the Improvement As-sociations, and the Relief Societies, and in all the capacities in which they arecalled to labor, as well as the brethren,in the building up of the kingdom of God. Amen 
 642 THE DESERET WEEKLY.Then he made some exclamation thatwas rather profane. I sat down and commenced warning him. I told himthat he had apostatized from the Gos-pel of Christ; he had had the Priest-hood and he was pursuing a course thatwould send him to destruction, and the judgments of God would overtakehim. Well, he raged like a demon. That is about all I said to him. I cer-tainly did not stay long, but I deliveredmy message. When I left the house hefollowed me, and when he came to where I was he fell dead at my feet as though he had been struck with a thun-derbolt from heaven. He was a very large man and he turned as black as anAfrican, and his skin seemed almost toburst open. The next day I attended his funeral. But he had raised a moband had sent word for them to comeand drive us out of the country or hang us, and they had sent warnings to us to leave. The consequence was, there were some fifteen or twenty deaths dur-ing my stay there. Men were takenwith what was called pleurisy. Doctors came in and opened a vein, and they died in five minutes. One of thesemen sent for me, and I went and sawhim. Two men were holding him. Hesaid to me, "I wish you would cut openmy side; I have a pain here and it is skin deep; yo[u] can cut it out and save my life." I looked at him, but did not say anything to him. I said to myself,"If your eyes were open, you would see the angel of death standing by your side." He died while I was there. After this my partner left me, and I went alone to Memphis, Tennessee, andmet with Brothers Patten and Parrish.After laboring in that part for a lengthof time, I received a letter from JosephSmith and Oliver Cowdery, in which they requested me to stay in that coun-try and take charge of the churches that we had built up there. The Proph-et promised me many things, and said I should lose no blessings by tarrying in that country and doing as he wished me,and letting the other brethren go and get their endowments. I was then atthe house of Brother Abraham O.Smoot's mother. I received this about sundown. I went into a little room where there was a sofa, to pray alone.I felt full of joy and rejoicings at the promises God had made to me throughthe Prophet. While I was upon myknees praying, my room was filled with light. I looked and a messenger stoodby my side. I arose, and this personage told me he had come to instruct me. He presented before me a panorama.He told me he wanted me to see withmy eyes and understand with my mindwhat was coming to pass in the earthbefore the coming of the Son of Man. He commenced with what the revela-tions say about the sun being turned to darkness, the moon to blood, and the stars falling from heaven. Those things were all presented to me one after another, as they will be, I suppose,when they are manifest before the com-ing of the Son of Man. Then he showed me the resurrection of thedead—what is termed the first and sec-ond resurrection. In the first resur-rection I saw no graves nor anyone raised from the grave. I saw legions of celestial beings, men and women who had received the Gospel all clothed inwhite robes. In the form they were presented to me, they had already beenraised from the grave. After this he showed me what is termed the second resurrection. Vast fields of graves were before me, and the Spirit of Godrested upon the earth like a shower of gentle rain, and when that fell upon thegraves they were opened, and an im-mense host of human beings cameforth. They were just as diversified intheir dress as we are here, or as they were laid down. This person-age taught me with regard to these things. Among other things he showed me, there were seven lions like burning brass placed in the heavens. I askedthe messenger what they were for. Hesaid they were representative of thedifferent dispensations of the Gospel of Christ to men, and they would all be seen in the heavens among the signs that would be shown. After this passedby me, he disappeared. Now, if I hadbeen a painter I could have drawn everything that I saw. It made an im-pression upon me that has never left me from that day to this. The next day we had a meeting in the academy. Brother Smoot and some others wentwith me; but I was a lost man. I hardly knew where I was, so enveloped was I in that which I had seen.I refer to this as one of the visitations that was given me in my boyhood, so to speak, in the Gospel. I was a Priest at the time. Of course, there was a motive in this personage visiting me andteaching me these principles. Heknew a great deal better than I didwhat lay before me in life. It wasdoubtless sent to me for the purpose ofstrengthening me and giving me en-couragement in my labors.The other instance I want to refer to is what I spoke about at the recent Gen-eral Conference. I need not dwell par-ticularly upon this now; but I had a motive in laying it before the people onthat occasion. The history of Brother Kimball's operations with those evil spirits in England is before the Church. And while on this point I want to cor-rect a mistake that I made in referringto this matter at our General Confer-ence. I got the names of Brother Kim-ball and Brother Hyde confused in mymind, and made it appear that Brother Kimball rebuked those evil spirits from Brother Hyde, when in fact it was Brother Kimball who was afflicted withthose spirits and Brother Hyde admin-istered to him. As this is a matter ofhistory, I wish to state it correctly, andtherefore make this explanation. When Brother Kimball, Brother GeorgeA. Smith and myself went to London, we encountered these evil spirits. Theysought to destroy us. The very firsthouse that was opened to us was filledwith devils. They had gathered therefor our destruction, so that we shouldnot plant the Gospel in that great cityBrother Kimball went to Manchester onsome business, and left Brother George A. Smith and myself there. One night we sat up till 11 o'clock, talking Mormonism, and then we went to bed. We had only just laid down when thesespirits rested upon us, and we were in a very fair way of losing our lives. Itwas as if a strong man had me by the throat, trying to choke me to death. Inthe midst of this a spirit told me to pray. I did so, and while praying, the door opened, the room was filled with light, and three messengers came in. Who they were I know not. They came andlaid their hands upon us, and rebukedthose powers, and thereby saved ourlives. Not only so, but by the power they held they rebuked the wholearmy of devils that were in that great city, and bound them so that they havenever troubled any Elder from that day to this.Now, those messengers were sent tous because it was necessary. We would have lost our lives if somebody had notdelivered us. We needed help, and we could not get it anywhere else.This is all I want to say with regard to the administration of angels to myself.This Apostle that I refer to told me hehad prayed and prayed for the adminis-tration of angels. Well, if it had been necessary to save his life, as it was inmy case, he would have had the admin-istration of angels. But he had accessto the gift of the Holy Ghost, as all of us have. And that, brethren and sisters,is what I want to talk to you about.One morning, while we were at Winter Quarters, Brother BrighamYoung said to me and the brethren that he had had a visitation the night previ-ous from Joseph Smith. I asked him what he said to him. He replied that Joseph had told him to tell the peopleto labor to obtain the Spirit of God; thatthey needed that to sustain them and to give them power to go through their work in the earth.Now I will give you a little of my ex-perience in this line. Joseph Smithvisited me a great deal after his death,and taught me many important princ-iples. The last time he visited me waswhile I was in a storm at sea. I was going on my last mission to preside inEngland. My companions were BrotherLeonard W. Hardy, Brother Milton Holmes, Brother Dan Jones, and anotherbrother, and my wife and two other wo-men. We had been traveling threedays and nights in a heavy gale, andwere being driven backwards. Finally I asked my companions to come into the cabin with me, and I told them topray that the Lord would change thewind. I had no fears of being lost; but I did not like the idea of being drivenback to New York, as I wanted to goon my journey. We all offered the same prayer, both men and women; and whenwe got through we stepped on to thedeck and in less than a minute it was asthough a man had taken a sword andcut that gale through, and you mighthave thrown a muslin handkerchief out and it would not have moved it. The night following this Joseph and Hyrumvisited me, and the Prophet laid beforeme a great many things. Among otherthings, he told me to get the Spirit ofGod; that all of us needed it. He also told me what the Twelve Apostles would be called to go through on theearth before the coming of the Son ofMan, and what the reward of theirlabors would be; but all that was taken from me, for some reason. Neverthe-less I know it was most glorious, al-though much would be required at ourhands.Joseph Smith continued visiting my-self and others up to a certain time, and then it stopped. The last time I saw him was in heaven. In the night vision I saw him at the door of the temple inheaven. He came and spoke to me. He said he could not stop to talk with me because he was in a hurry. The next man I met was Father Smith; hecould not talk with me because he wasin a hurry. I met half a dozen brethren who had held high positions on earth,

Saviors upon Mount Zion have been raised up, while the kingdomis the Lord's, as the Prophet Obadiahsaid they would be. This people aredoing this work now.  The Lord is with you, and your progenitors in the spiritworld rejoice.  Let us be faithful, there-fore, while we are here.  God has ap-pointed us to bear this Priesthood.  Out of the fourteen hundred millions of people on the earth the Lord has chosenthis handful of men to bear this; to or-dain, to organize, to warn the world, topreach the Gospel to them.  I hope mybrethren that bear this Priesthood will remember the value of it.  I want to read a few more paragraphs from this same revelation, and then I will close:For there is a time appointed for every man,according as his works shall be.God shall give unto you (the Saints) knowl-edge by his Holy Spirit, yea by the unspeak-able gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not beenrevealed since the world was until now;Which our forefathers have waited with anxious expectation to be revealed in the lasttimes, which their minds were pointed to, bythe angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory:A time to come in the which nothing shall bewithheld, whether there be one God or many Gods, they shall be manifest;All thrones and dominions, principalities andpowers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel ofJesus Christ.And also if there be bounds set to the heavens,or to the seas; or to the dry land, or to the sun,moon, or stars;All the times of their revolutions; all the appointed days, months, and years, and all thedays of their days, months, and years, and alltheir glories, laws, and set times, shall be re-vealed, in the days of the dispensation of thefulness of times,According to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other Gods, before this world was, that shouldbe reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into hiseternal presence, and into his immortal rest.There are things in that revelation that are marvelous and wonderful.  Allthrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed to the Saints of God in the own set time of theLord.  Today we are in this little world, surrounded with a great many planets that are at present unknown to us. Wescarcely know what is on this world. We know less about Mars, or Venus, orJupiter, or these worlds that are neigh-bors to us.  But here we are given to understand that all these worlds will berevealed.  A man's mind must becomeimmortal, and must stretch as wide aseternity and be filled with the glory ofGod, to ever comprehend these great blessings which are promised unto Hispeople.  Therefore, let us be true andfaithful.  Do not let us lose our hold on the Priesthood, nor upon the kingdomof God.  Let us go in secret prayer be-fore the Lord and call upon His holy name.  There is where our strength lies. I pray that God's blessings may rest up-on all of us.  We shall all find our re-cord in the great library of heaven; andI hope we may so live that when we come to meet that record we will besatisfied with it.  I pray God to blessPresident Smoot, his counselors, and those who bear the Priesthood here, aswell as our brethren and sisters, unto the end that we may inherit eternal life, for Jesus' sake.  Amen.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  643and none of them could stop to talk with me because they were in a hurry.I was much astonished. By and by Isaw the Prophet again, and I got the privilege to ask him a question. "Now,"said I, "I want to know why you are ina hurry. I have been in a hurry all through my life; but I expected myhurry would be over when I got into thekingdom of heaven, if I ever did." Joseph said: "I will tell you, Brother Woodruff. Every dispensation that has had the Priesthood on the earth and has gone into the celestial kingdom, hashad a certain amount of work to do toprepare to go to the earth with theSavior when He goes to reign on the earth. Each dispensation has hadample time to do this work. We havenot. We are the last dispensation, and so much work has to be done, and we need to be in a hurry in order to ac-complish it." Of course, that was satisfactory to me, but it was new doc-trine to me.Brigham Young also visited me after his death. On one occasion he andBrother Heber C. Kimball came in a splendid chariot, with fine white horses, and accompanied me to a conferencethat I was going to attend. When I got there I asked Brother Brigham if hewould take charge of the conference."No," said he, "I have done my workhere. I have come to see what you aredoing and what you are teaching thepeople." And he told me what JosephSmith had taught him in Winter Quar-ters, to teach the people to get the Spiritof God. He said, "I want you to teachthe people to get the Spirit of God. You cannot build up the Kingdom of God without that."That is what I want to say to thebrethren and sisters here today. Every man and woman in this Church should labor to get that Spirit. We are sur-rounded by these evil spirits that are atwar against God and against everything looking to the building up of the king-dom of God; and we need this Holy Spirit to enable us to overcome theseinfluences. I have had the Holy Ghostin my travels. Every man has that has gone out into the vineyard and labored faithfully for the cause of God. I havereferred to the administration of angelsto myself. What did these angels do? One of them taught me some things re-lating to the signs that should precedethe coming of the Son of Man. Others came and saved my life. What then?They turned and left me. But how is itwith the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost does not leave me if I do my duty. It does not leave any man who does his duty. We have known this all the waythrough. Joseph Smith told BrotherJohn Taylor on one occasion to labor toget the Spirit of God, and to follow itsdictation, and it would become a prin-ciple of revelation within him. God hasblessed me with that, and everything I have done since I have been in this Church has been done upon that prin-ciple. The Spirit of God has told me what to do, and I have had to follow that.In the time of the apostasy in Kirt-land, Joseph Smith hardly knew when he met a man, unless the Spirit of God revealed it to him, whether he was friend or foe. Most of the leading men were fighting him. Right in the midst of that darkness the Spirit of God said to me,"You choose a partner and go straightto Fox Islands." Well, I knew no more what was on Fox Islands than what was on Kolob. But the Lord told me to go,and I went. I chose Jonathan H. Hale, and he went with me. We cast out somedevils there, preached the Gospel and performed some miracles. I crossedlake Ontario and went into Connecticut,where my father lived. I had not seen one of my relatives from the time I em-braced the Gospel. I preached the Gos-pel there, and baptized my father, mystepmother, and sister, and uncles andaunts, and organized a branch there. Every member of that branch was a relative of mine, excepting one, and hewas a Methodist class leader who board-ed at my father's house. This was all promised to me by old father Smith when he blessed me. I got to Fox Is-lands, and did a good work there. Through the blessings of God I broughtnearly a hundred from there up to Zion,at the time the Saints were driven out ofMissouri into Illinois.So it has been all through my life. If I have undertaken to do anything, andthe Lord has wanted me to do some-thing else, He has had to tell me. Whenwe were sent to England, we were sentby revelation. I went into the Stafford-shire potteries with Brother Alfred Cor-don. We were doing a splendid work,baptizing almost every night, and Ithought it was the finest mission I ever was on. I went into the town of Hanley one night, and attended meeting in a large hall, which was filled to overflow-ing. The Spirit of the Lord came uponme and said that that was the last meet-ing I should hold with that people for many days. I told the people that that was the last meeting I should be with them. After the meeting, they askedme where I was going. I told them I did not know. In the morning I askedthe Lord what He wanted of me. He merely said, "Go to the south." I gotinto the stage and rode eighty miles[.]The first man's house I stopped at wasJohn Benbow's in Herefordshire. In half an hour after I entered the house Iknew exactly why the Lord had sent me. There was a people there who had been praying for the ancient order of things. They were waiting for theGospel as it was taught by Christ andHis Apostles. The consequence was, the first thirty days after I got there I baptized six hundred of those people.In eight month's labor in that country Ibrought eighteen hundred into theChurch. Why? Because there was apeople prepared for the Gospel, and theLord sent me there to do that work. I have always had to give God the glory for everything good that has happenedto me; for I have realized by whatpower it came.When I got back to Winter Quarters from the pioneer journey, President Young said to me, "Brother Woodruff,I want you to take your wife and chil-dren and go to Boston, and stay there until you can gather every Saint of Godin New England and Canada and send them up to Zion." I did as he told me. It took me two years to gather up every-body, and I brought up the rear with a company. When I got into Pittsburg with this company it was dusk, and I sawa steamer just preparing to go out. I walked right up to the captain and askedhim if he was ready to go out. He saidhe was. "How many passengers haveyou?" "Two hundred and fifty." "Can you take another hundred?" "I can.""Then," said I, "I would like to go aboard with you." The words were hardly out of my mouth when the HolyGhost said to me, "Don't you, nor your company go aboard that steamer."That was enough; I had learned the voice of the Spirit. I turned and toldthe captain that I had made up my mind not to go at present. That steamerstarted out. It was a dark night, andbefore the steamer had gone far shetook fire, and all on board was lost. Weshould probably have shared the samefate, had it not been for that monitorwithin me.I refer to these things because I want you to get the same Spirit. All the Elders of Israel, whether abroad or at home, need that Spirit. When I was onmy way east at one time I drove into a man's yard in Indiana. Brother Orson Hyde had driven in and set his wagon inthe dooryard, and I set mine by the sideof it. I turned my mules and tied them up to an oak tree. I had my wife and two children with me in my carriage. We went to lie down, and the Holy Spirit told me to get up and move my carriage. I got right up. My wife asked me what I was going to do. I said I was going to move the carriage.She wanted to know what for. I toldher I did not know. I moved the carriage about fifteen rods, looked around, and then went to bed again. The Spirit told me to get up again andmove my mules. I did so. In twenty minutes there came up a whirlwind that blew that oak tree down and laid itright across where my carriage had been. By listening to that Spirit our lives were saved.Now, it was not an angel that pointed out these things to me; it was the Holy Ghost. This is the Spirit that we must have to carry out the purposes of Godon the earth. We need that more thanany other gift. I felt impressed yester-day to teach this principle to the Latter-day Saints. We are in the midst of enemies, in the midst of darkness andtemptation, and we need to be guidedby the Spirit of God. We should pray to the Lord until we get the Comforter. This is what is promised to us when weare baptized. It is the spirit of light, of truth, and of revelation, and can be withall of us at the same time.Brethren and sisters, God bless you. I am glad to meet with you. There arevery few of you as old as I am. Howlong I shall tarry in this country I donot know; but while I do stay I want todo what good I can. These are prin-ciples that have rested a great deal uponmy mind. If we labor for this Spirit,we will have no quarreling, and no dif-ficulty, so long as that is dwelling with-in us. God bless you. Amen. 
 Let us do our duty; let us cease settingour hearts upon the fashions and things ofthis world, and laboring to enrich ourselvesat the sacrifice of the kingdom of God. We have a co-operative mercantile institu-tion; and it is the duty of these Latter-day Saints to sustain and uphold it; and so with everything else that is in thekingdom, for these are the stepping stonesto us to a fullness of the celestial king-dom of God.I thank God that I live in this day andage of the world, when my ears have heardthe sound of the fullness of the gospel ofChrist. I thank God that I have seen theface of prophets, apostles, and inspired men. I rejoice in this, and I pray God myheavenly Father that I, and my brethrenand sisters, may have power to unite and take hold and build up this kingdom. When we do this it will not be in the pow-er of earth or hell to take away our rights and privileges; for I tell you that if this people were united according to the law ofGod, wherein we should become fully jus-tified before the Lord, sinners in Zion would tremble and fearfulness would sur-prise the hypocrite; the power of Godwould rest upon Zion, the angels of Godwould visit the earth, the judgments of God would be poured upon the wicked,the Zion of God would be redeemed, thetemples of God would be reared, the prison doors would be opened and theprisoners in the spirit world would go free, because we would feel the spirit andpower of our mission and calling andshould fulfill it.I pray that God will bless this peopleand that he will bless President Youngwho has already outlived four of his coun-selors. The Lord says—"I will take whomI will take, and I will preserve whom I will preserve." All these counselors wereyounger men than President Young, yethe has outlived them. God has ordained President Young to live, and he has livedso long, and has had the prayers of hun-dreds and thousands of Saints, which have entered into the ears of the Lord ofSabaoth for his preservation; and the Lordhas heard and answered these prayers.Let us, as Elders of Israel, rise up andbear off this kingdom. Let us forsakeour evils and wickedness, and repent of our sins, and renew our covenants and keep the commandments of God; that wemay lighten the burdens of our President,that his spirit may be cheered, and thatthe power of God may attend him in his labors for the advancement of Zion uponthe earth.This is my prayer in the name of Jesus, Amen.
