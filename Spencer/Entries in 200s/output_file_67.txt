I have been  obliged to cease my labors in the Office, through a productive  illness; but I have never lost sight of your kindness both  to me &amp; my family; and I hope hereafter to honor your  memory for the same. My illness was caused by too long  confinement to the Star office; this produced indigestion and  consumption followed by piles of a very painful nature.  But through the earnest faith of the Saints I am now  pretty well restored to health. I have been travelling  for near two months past among the Conferences  preaching &amp; stirring up the church to pay their  tithing. I feel encouraged to believe that I shall  gather a pretty good sum for the temple.

Invitations, we understand are being sent out to all the immediate States and Territories, the intention being to have such a representative gathering as  will give marked importance to the meeting. Various subjects are to be discussed, particular the law of libel, and other questions which directly con- cern the newspaper fraternity. Elab- orate preparations are also being made to entertain these guests in a way to keep up the old reputation of Salt Lake City for hospitality. We think the citi- zens ought to take an interest in this,  for every such meeting has a tendency  to give more dignity to the journalistic profession, to enable it to be of more use to the people. Good newspapers are the greatest blessings that any commun- ity ever had. Their influence extends  all through mens lives, and it is possible  for a good newspaper to make all the  community about it stronger and better. Modern newspapers came with the steam engine, the electric telegraph and the great advancements which have been made by the exploration of science. It is an absolute necessity to the modern man and woman, and this being true, every effort to make it higher and nobler ought to be supported and encouraged.  We hope the Press Association will have  a gathering such as that anticipated, and  that the results of it will be only for good.—   arrangements for a conference of west- ern newspaper men in this city the latter part of August. It is expected the con- ference will spread over several days and will result in a western editors' fed- eration being formed, the special  mission of which will be to secure the enacting by the legislatures of the west- ern states such laws in regard to libel as may relieve the fraternity from some of the injustices they now labor under.  The visitors while here will be hand- somely entertained, and it is expected their visit will prove a fine advertisement for this territory.— ENDENTRY  WILL A. COLE, PROPRIETOR.     Salt Lake City.

I have written several to you, which I have sent by private conveyance, in sh Cape Horn, and sister Badlam has sent several by steamer; but I have not seen any she has sent to you, and do not know what she has written, as I have generally been gone when she has written, and, not knowing how much church news she has sent you, I feel it to be my duty to fill a sheet to you and send it by mail, and perhaps I ought to have done it before this. You have been very diligent in writing to me and your family, and your letters have been highly interesting. I feel thankful that you have got along so well and been prospered on your journey and arrived in safety at San Francisco. I have felt to pray for you continually, from day to day. Since you left here I have been gone from home most of the time, and have only remained at home about long enough to answer my correspond- ing letters, write my journal, and close up such work as seemed necessary to be done, and then I am off again. I have visited Boston, or even Cambridgeport, but little since you left, only going and returning from my journeys. I was much interested in the account you gave me of Pana- ma and journey from Chagres, also your success on the ship with the pas- sengers, and the account you gave after you landed.   the gold diggings of San Francisco, but they are very conflicting in thei^r^ statements. I expect dry goods must be very cheap by this time in San Francisco. In order to do by you as you have done by me, I will go back to the time you left and give you a ^little^ history of events as they have passed along with me since we parted. Soon after you left I wrote some lengthy letters to the Presidency in the Valley, spoke of your course, and the object of your going to San Francisco, that you went with my counsel to.

They want cotton and woollen manufactorors Iron founders farmers and machanics of all kinds to come on with-out delay. And I hereby delegate and apoint Elder Edson Whipple to cooperate with me in assisting me to carry out the instructions of the presidency in the gathering of the Saints to Zion from the Eastern States at this late hour of the day I call upon all the Saints that Elder Whipple may visit to give heed to his instructions And carry out his advise and instructions upon the subject of the gathering And the Blessing of the Lord will rest upon you. Elder Whipple is capable of instructing and edifying you and of giving you corecct council upon this subject he has been with me knows my plans in the gathering and has had the instruction which I have recieved There will be three companies of Saints leave the Eastern States about the first of April St Louis.

I felt that if there is an immortal spirit dwelling in a morta mortal body that can lie down in death in sweet repose, it is Sister Eliza. When I contemplate your life and labors of love to all classes of Latter-day Saints,        And that you have passed through all the afflictions, tribulations, and persecution with the Saints and have dwelt in the flesh almost three generations, as man counts time, I say when I reflect upon these things, I feel that you, sister Eliza, an elect Lady of the Lord, can lay down your mortal body when the time comes without a sting, a pang or a regret and pass on to your work on the other side of the Veil to a far higher state of glory where you will find a host of Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles and Saints, as well as a large army of children who await your coming and will greet you with joy and rejoicing. I can say of a truth that your eye hath not seen, your ear heard, neither hath it entered into your heart to conceive the honor and glory that awaiteth you on the other side of the Veil.   of corn fully ripe. When your spirit leaves your body you will find a host of friends to greet you who await your coming. I hope when I have finis to meet with the same company that will greet you with joy.

Should you meet with that company of loyal friends, that Heavenly throng before I do, I have  will give my kind love to George and the hosts of brethren you will meet as well as those loyal sisters Phoebe, Margaret and t to the army of those faithful daughters of the Lord with whom we have both associated here on earth. As to myself, I have just passed my fourscore years, I am still in very good health, and as circumstances still deprive me of speaking in public to the living, I am trying to labor what I can for the dead. I met on the 2nd of March 125 friends in the Temple of the Lord, 73 of which got endowments for my dead. I addressed them for a short time. I was sealed while there for 73 couples of dead which makes about 3000 of my dead which I have done endowments and sealings for and which leaves me about 265 more to work for before I finish my record which I am in hopes to live to accomplish. I have had a great anxiety for the redemption of my dead while I dwell in the flesh. I met you in the Social Hall at the reception on your 80th birthday but I do not recall your present age. I do not wish to weary you with a lengthy communication, neither do I wish to trouble you with writing to me not knowing the state of your health, but should your brother Lorenzo be with you or any friend who could send me a few lines to let me know your state of health, it would be a consolation to me. I pray God to bless you with joy and peace during your remaining days and hours and when your hour of departure comes that you may die in the Lord and sleep in peace which is my earnest prayer.

I opened my own hired house for meet- ings on Sunday and one evening in the week, which I have kept up to this day, except part of the time on Sunday at brother Bird's. I had full houses and I baptized a dozen or so. One was Mr. Snow and wife, a Uni- versalist, and a keeper of one of the engines; another was Andrew Delin, from Sweden, a smart man and one that I think will be useful in a future day, in carrying the Gospel to his own nation. Another was father Ezra Carter, Mrs. Woodruff's father. He was 78 years old, is smart, walked to the top of Bunker Hill monument with me. He is strong in the faith. I was truly glad to baptize him, as he has been believing for seven years Mrs. Woodruff feels that it amply pays her for coming to this country. Elder Whipple, one of the pioneers f eral days with me, and brought several of his relatives out to meeting. Father Carter spent about one month with me. Calvin I. Foss, son of sister Sarah B. Foss, also called upon me, and wished me to assist him in getting into a good company to go to the gold diggings; so after looking around, I got him into the Massachusetts Bay Store, Mining and Trading Company. He left for San Francisco on the ship Acrates, on the 5th of April. I sent letters and papers to you by him. He wrote from Rio Janeiro, was getting along well. I expect he will call upon you. Bradford, died on the 20th of February, a S I left home early in the spring for the west, visited New York, W. I. Appleby to start off for the Bluffs from Philadelphia, with a company of 80 Saint^s^ 50 from the Philadelphia Branch. He arrived at St. Louis all safe with all his family; baptized four of his family, three sons and one daughter, the day before he started. But when he arrived in St. Louis, the chole was raging in all its horrors, from Galena, and up the state, slaying its thousands. Every steamer on all those rivers was pickled with the cholora, and officers, crews, and passengers were dying by scores. He went on board of the steamer Monroe, bound for St. Joseph's, with a company of soldiers or go diggers, bound for California, and the cholera was on board when he went  on to it. About a hundred Saints went on with brother Appleby. By the ENDENTRY  ENDENTRY  and passed through much toil &amp; Affliction for these things  thou wilt have a great reward.

The names of the Saints, as far as I can recollect, are as follows: From wife and two daughters, bro. Hampton and part of family, sister Brown. From Lavina Hodges. When the boat landed, all the crew that was left, with the passengers, fled int^o^ the city. It was reported in several letters that Elder Appleby was dead, but it was false. He slipped on board of another boat, and arriv- ed at the Bluffs with his family and the rest of the company, all well, and is now on his way to the valley, with a company. I sent all of my letters and papers on by him.   one to two hundred deaths in that city daily by cholera, in a population of 50,000. There has been some 5000 deaths by cholera in that city in five weeks. It has swept all through Indepen- dence. It is said that 35,000 gold seekers, bound for San Francisco, have gone on to the plains to take the overland route via South Pass of the St. Joseph, Kanesville. The greatest number was at Inde- pendence. The papers say that the cholera was so bad in that town that the gold diggers all left in a fright, and did not stop to bury their dead, but piled them up in their winding sheets by the way side in heaps of five and six together, and the road was strewn with the dead, until it was awful and horrible in the extreme to behold; so say those who wit- nessed it. These companies had over 60,000 head of cattle and horses, and if the history of those companies does not tell a tale for the re- corder before they reach the gold diggings, then I am mistaken. Thous- ands of their cattle died before they got to the Black Hills, and many men, and some thousands, are returning back. Cholera has been fatal at Ill. About 5,000 deaths at New York. It has ranged in Boston from 10 to 78 deaths daily, 78 being the highest number. It is still all around us, but on the decrease.

Many noted men have fallen this summer by the cholera, among whom are President Worth, Col. Harding, Mrs. Taylor has been attacked, but got better. The chol^-^ era is also raging at the present time, through Paris, and most of Europe. Many deaths are on most of the emigrant ships now landing at New York. There has been but few deaths among the Saints, considering the many who have been among it. Capt. Liverpool in February with a fleet of six ships, with about 1500 Saints. All land^-^ ed safe at Council Bluffs in the midst of the worst time of the cholera. There was about fifty deaths out of the whole number, mostly on the Missouri River. Jones and Spen- cer are on their way to the valley. I do not know what success the Saints will have this season in crossing the mountains, as I should not think there would be grass enough through the Black Hills for the animals of the gold diggers alone to stand  Smith and E. T. Benson have gone with companies to the valley. Elder Hyde is left at the Bluffs, still printing the papers and counselling the people. The Saints at Pottawatomie Co. have escaped the cholera this season, while it has been all around them. Sanducky City, Ohio, had a population of 4,000, was entirely depopulated with the cholera, until  there was not 400 left; every doctor, lawyer and priest in the place, with most of the population, died. There was none to attend to the sick or bury the dead, and the last account, many remained in their houses un- buried. There have been many calamities taking place in the States since you left. A mob of some 20,000 gathered at the Astor Place The- atre, broke in the doors and windows, was fired upon by the military, 25  killed, 50 wounded. Large mobs in Philadelphia once a month, more or less killed. More than one half of the business part of the City of St. Louis, Mo, is laid in ashes. It burned  all the insurance offices, five banking houses, telegraph office, 25 steam boats, and a loss of six million ($6,000,000) dollars. They have had another fire since; several steam boats and dwellings burned; a mob raised; some lives lost; the cholera followed the fire, and laid its thousands in the grave.

Watertown, New York, is burned up. Also $60,000 worth of Milwa^u^kie is also burned, and large fires in almost every town; many fires in you left. I have just returned from a mission of two months in Mir- amichi, Nova Scotia, &amp;c., and I have seen two hundred miles square of those provinces either burned over this spring or burning while I was there. Such fires were never known in that country. No rain in that country from April to August, and the fires got into the forest, and burned hundreds of miles over, sweeping fences, dwellings, barns, mill^s^, lumber yards, towns, cities, &amp;c., all before it, in some in- stances driving the entire population on to the beach or into the sea. It seems as though nearly the whole country was ruined, and the fires not bringing trouble enough, the people have risen in mobs, burned the Par- liament houses, and government property, stoned and egged the Governor, and the people seem bent on burning up everything that is left, and kill- ing each other. The day before I got to St. John's a company of Orange men were marching in procession, were stoned by the Catholics, a fight ensued; about twenty were killed and twice that number wounded. They fought with stones, clubs, rifles, muskets, &amp;c. I was on the ground on the occasion, and the doors and windows were riddled with bullets and slugs. The people were much excited the day I was there. I found the whole country through which I travelled in a horrid state; the people in  a state of starvation. No business going on; all trying to go to the states for better. The people were leaving with their packs on their backs. I had a hard journey through that country; was sick part of the time. I spent one week very pleasantly with Capt. Joseph Russell, of Miramichi. He owns the whole Island he is on; has expended some $30,00^0^ in buildings; says he will sell the whole at auction on the 5th of Sep- tember if he does not get ^£^50 for it. He has three new ships not sold, about 700 tons each, which he will sell in Liverpool market; will go from valley one year from next spring.

Brother Bird has been dangerously sick for few days, is now getting about again.   troops have finally entered Rome. The Hungarian armies are defeating the united armies of Austria. Fifty-two thousand Jews are now fighting with the Hungarians, against the Russians. The Jews have now Rabbis in America collecting money to lay the foundation of their temple in Jerusalem. The signs of the times are big with events at the present day. As concerning your family since you have been gone, I will say I think they have got along very well, as far as I know; they have mostly had good health. Alexander was attacked very suddenly with vom- iting and other sickness. I administered to him by anointing of oil, laying on of hands and prayer. He was well next day. I dont know of any other sickness in the family. I have been gone from home so much, I have not been able to call upon them as much as I would like to. When- ever I have had an opportunity I have enquired into their circumstances. I do not think they have had an opportunity of selling but very little varnish since you went away. I told sister Badlam to let me know her wants, and I would divide with her. My means has been very limited this season. I have had as much as I could do to meet my rent, get bread for my family, and pay my travelling bills. She has never called upon me for means, only in two or three instances, and then for a little change. I have always given double the amount called for, and the whole of it put together would hardly have bought a breakfast at San Francisco. A few days since she called for twenty five cents, and Mrs. Woodruff gave her fifty cents, and I gave her $5.00. I wish it had been a hundred, for I have no doubt that they needed it, but he that has not got cannot give. Phebe Foss, Mrs. Woodruff's nieces, who are at our house, attended, as Mary was going away on a visit for a while down to Mc.Clare has conveyed an idea to me that he intended to assist your family while you were gone, but do not expect that he has done much yet, except perhaps attending to some bill or two which was due.

A bare majority of the people may reject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con- genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receiving office on the line through which revelation can come to them.
