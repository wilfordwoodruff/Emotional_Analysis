Dear Brethren.  Some years ago, while in the South, I compiled a compendium of the preinciples of the gosple, to my own ideas, according to the instruc- tions of Bro Roberts. In it I simply gave the porport of the passages, in as concise language as possible, and just enough argument to throw one who ^had^ already perused "oOrson pPratts" Works" on to the thread of argument.  Owning in a printing office here, and having partly learned the traid, I have been getting the work up in lessons for the eElders Quorum over which I priside, and hearing one of our lately returned missionaries suggest that a small book of referances would be a treat to Elders.

The main thing clained is the size, but the few lines of arguments thrown in between the passages to refresh the mind, and lead the learner to understand what point to make in a certain passage is also a matter worth mentioning in my mind.  The subjects I have written out are "The fall of man", "The Atonement of Christ" "Faith" including the personality of God, or the person in whome we should have faith. "Repentance" "Baptism" "Spirit of Good" or Holy Ghost. "Devine authority", "New revelation", "Evidences of the Bible and Book of Mormon Compared" "Pass over or Sacrament" "Gathering of Israel" "Scattering of Israel"  "Apostacy"  "Retoration" "Organization" "Redemption of the dead" "Plurality of wives not unscriptirial" ENDENTRY untill I heard the remarks  of Pres.

Your letter from Long Island was nice this evening, and I hasten to Say to you that you should have written to Orson Pratt the Same Statements that you have written to me.  He is the presiding officer of the Church in England, and Littlefield, it appears, has returned there and is under Bro. Pratts immediate jurisdiction.  Such conduct as he is guilty of to all appearances, should be Sufficient to cause his immediate ex- communication from the Church, and let him labor with his hands for his support, and return to this place if he has any desire to be Saved. If you have written to bro. Pratt concerning him all will be well; but if you have not, I wish you to do so, and add my Sayings to your letter.  Bro. Oliver Cowdry has assisted me to put up my press to day. Hase has returned here with his family—made his satisfaction to the Church and has been voted to the rec'd by baptism. I expect to baptize him tomorrow. I hope to get my paper out this Month and Shall forward it to you immediately thereafter. With regard to any particular trouble here, I have no fears at present. Still, I do not know what the Devil and wicked men may do. I am in the house of the Lord and so are they. His will be done.

I will come down at any time, if you think it ecessary, and show you all the manuscript.  Very Respectifully Lamoni Call.  I see no reason why bro. Call should not have full liberty to publish his little work and let it stand on its own mirits. He, of course to do the work at his own expense and risk. I would suggest that President Hess and Grant would be good judges of its soundness in doctrine, and that Bro. Call submit the proofs to them, and if they are doubful of any point they could rifer it to the High Councel or to the Presidency, or one of the Apostles-as they found most convenient. J. F. S.

Woodruff  Dear Bro  Your kind letter  written last Spring came duly to hand, and livin I learnt  your address, I have frequently wished to make a  written acknowledgement of your kindness as soon as a  convienent opportunity should present. I have been  obliged to cease my labors in the Office, through a productive  illness; but I have never lost sight of your kindness both  to me and my family; and I hope hereafter to honor your  memory for the same. My illness was caused by too long  confinement to the Star office; this produced indigestion and  consumption followed by piles of a very painful nature.  But through the earnest faith of the Saints I am now  pretty well restored to health. I have been travelling  for near two months past among the Conferences  preaching and stirring up the church to pay their  tithing. I feel encouraged to believe that I shall  gather a pretty good sum for the temple. There are  several saints expecting soon to come into prosperation  of large sums of money, before I sail for America.  From them (4 persons) I hope to receive several  thousand pounds as tithing to gladden the hearts of  the saints in the valley.  ENDENTRY Mantua, Box Elder Co. June 25, 1894  Prs. W.

The visitors will be here Aug. 27th and 28th, on which dates a fraternal convention will be held in this city, for the purpose of considering matters affecting our mutual interests in the hope of creating a closer and more friendly ac- quaintance with our brethren of the press in the great transmissis- sippi states.

It is therefore the intention of the mangagment of this af- fair to give a complimentary concert to the visitors in the grand old Tabernacle, if the favor of its use can be obtained for that  purpose.

Utah Editors Preparing to Entertain Their Visiting Brethren of the  Scissors and Quill.  It begins to look now as though the Utah Press Association's invitation to the editors of the Western States, to hold a convention in this city, next  month, will be a bigger affair than was at first expected, at least the favorable responses A. B. Tomson, corresponding  secretary of the U. P. A., is daily re- ceiving, give every indication such will be the case. Editors are sending enthusiastic letters to Mr. Tomson, approving the idea of holding the con- vention, and expressing their pleasure on account of the opportunity afforded for so grand a midsummer outing as the editors are arranging. The below extracts from correspondence received  by secretary Tomson, indicate how  well the idea takes outside of this Ter- ritory.  Ore- gon Press association, writes: "Your  invitation to attend meeting in Salt Lake accepted by unanimons vote at our annual meeting held in Newport July 20 24th, and a delegation will visit your fair city."  The president of the Wisconsin as- sociation, John Neagle writes: "Can  say that our trip to Salt Lake is assured. Your dates will suit us. I appreciate your courtesy in this matter and write you most heartily in acknowledg- ment."  F. G. Simmons, chairman of the executive committee of the Nebraska Press association, writes: "Please give me full particulars, including the prob- able expense, length of time required and any other information that you can. We had another trip under con- sideration, later in the season, but I  should be glad to hear all about your  excursion, and perhaps we would find  it better to go with you."  F. N. Merwin, editor of the Ne- braska Editor, writes: "Whether or not the association takes the excursion I am desirous of doing so, and you can count on my being there."  The editor of Ranch and Range, W.  S. Irwin, Nowata, I. T., writes: "Yours at hand this morning and con- tents noted. It is with pleasure that I note your enthusiasm for the approach- ing gathering and courtesy for 'Sun- flower' and 'B. I. T.' editors. The  meeting should, and doubtless will, accomplish much for Western journal- ism, and in no wise more than socially and fraternally. Let the good work go on."  In- dian Territory, write: "Replying to yours of the 13th, will say that the Register will certainly be represented at the association if satisfactory ar- rangements are made for transporta- tion, for which we have already asked. There are questions that a few of us are interested in in this Territory that could very properly and beneficially be  discussed by the Western association you propose to form, and it would be  our purpose to bring these before the  said association."

ENDENTRY C. B. Davis ENDENTRY THE GREAT PRESS ASSOCIATION MEETING.  The Utah Press Association is mak- ing arrangements to have a great meet- ing here the last days of next month. Invitations, we understand are being sent out to all the immediate States and Territories, the intention being to have such a representative gathering as  will give marked importance to the meeting. Various subjects are to be discussed, particular the law of libel, and other questions which directly con- cern the newspaper fraternity. Elab- orate preparations are also being made to entertain these guests in a way to keep up the old reputation of Salt Lake City for hospitality. We think the citi- zens ought to take an interest in this,  for every such meeting has a tendency  to give more dignity to the journalistic profession, to enable it to be of more use to the people. Good newspapers are the greatest blessings that any commun- ity ever had. Their influence extends  all through mens lives, and it is possible  for a good newspaper to make all the  community about it stronger and better. Modern newspapers came with the steam engine, the electric telegraph and the great advancements which have been made by the exploration of science. It is an absolute necessity to the modern man and woman, and this being true, every effort to make it higher and nobler ought to be supported and encouraged.  We hope the Press Association will have  a gathering such as that anticipated, and  that the results of it will be only for good.—Salt Lake Tribune.  The Utah Press Association is making arrangements for a conference of west- ern newspaper men in this city the latter part of August. It is expected the con- ference will spread over several days and will result in a western editors' fed- eration being formed, the special  mission of which will be to secure the enacting by the legislatures of the west- ern states such laws in regard to libel as may relieve the fraternity from some of the injustices they now labor under.  The visitors while here will be hand- somely entertained, and it is expected their visit will prove a fine advertisement for this territory.—Salt Lake Herald. ENDENTRY AMERICAN HOUSE WILL A.

The outside fracture is about 5 ft long perpendicularly and averaging 6  inches in width. The part which passed through the N. side of the tower went down the side of the tower till it reached the main roof; here it tore the roofing canvas from the fastenings on the inside of the main roof parapet, and apparently went down the roof drain pipe to the large cistern without doing further damage.

Cannon and  Joseph F Smith,  Salt Lake City.  Beloved Leaders of Zion,  There is a subject I feel to lay before you that has occupied my thought a great deal of late, so much so, that I wrote the Church Historian, Apostle F. D. Richards, about it, but feel I should have writen you direct.  It ^is^ concerning some very sacred objects I once had the honor of calling my own. They are two Seer Stones, and a flint arrow point. As you know, these choice relics had once been the property of the Prophet Joseph, and later on, of my honored fathers. This fact alone tells how I prized them. Because of their great historical value, and sacred nature, I was led part with them, and put them where they properly belonged, into the hands of the President of the Church.  There is a question naturally arises, If they are retained in ENDENTRY inform Bro Leithead. I also think that there is ^no^ need of useing any more Tithing towards fixing up the ferry. The proceeds of the ferry should certainly be enough to keep every- thing in repair from this time on, and leave considerable towards improving the roads or for some other good purpose.  Please excuse me if I am too free in making suggestions  We have been very busy for about two months,  Have crossed since the first of August 393 wagons.  I think the rush is now over for the season  The weather has been very mild and pleasant during December thus far.  With kind regards for yourself and family, thanking you for all your kindness to me  I remain yours in the Gospel  Warren. M Johnson  ENDENTRY Copy  Cambridgeport, Mass.,  August 23rd, 1849.  Elder Badlam,  Dear Brother:  We have received two long interesting letters from you, one from San Francisco about six days; also one from Chagress, making three in all. I have written several to you, which I have sent by private conveyance, in shaips that go around Cape Horn, and sister Badlam has sent several by steamer; but I have not seen any she has sent to you, and do not know what she has written, as I have generally been gone when she has written, and, not knowing how much church news she has sent you, I feel it to be my duty to fill a sheet to you and send it by mail, and perhaps I ought to have done it before this. You have been very diligent in writing to me and your family, and your letters have been highly interesting. I feel thankful that you have got along so well and been prospered on your journey and arrived in safety at San Francisco. I have felt to pray for you continually, from day to day. Since you left here I have been gone from home most of the time, and have only remained at home about long enough to answer my correspond- ing letters, write my journal, and close up such work as seemed necessary to be done, and then I am off again. I have visited Boston, or even Cambridgeport, but little since you left, only going and returning from my journeys. I was much interested in the account you gave me of Pana- ma and journey from Chagres, also your success on the ship with the pas- sengers, and the account you gave after you landed.  The New York Herald publishes every week a number of letters from the gold diggings of San Francisco, but they are very conflicting in thei^r^ statements. I expect dry goods must be very cheap by this time in San Francisco. In order to do by you as you have done by me, I will go back to the time you left and give you a ^little^ history of events as they have passed along with me since we parted. Soon after you left I wrote some lengthy letters to the Presidency in the Valley, spoke of your course, and the object of your going to San Francisco, that you went with my counsel to. We were notified by the keepers of the Boydston Hall that we could have ENDENTRY families, as heir-looms, why should they not remain in the family of Brigham Young? but this answer comes with great force, has any family a right to retain such important and clearly, "church property" relics as individual posessions. No they should be forever retained as church property, "His mouth peice" being their guardian.  Tell me are my impressions right? "The right" is my only desire, and in your hands I leave it.  The saints are in excellent health and a spirit of peace prevails, quite a number of new convert, and as usual, an excellant crop of "home emigrants." Good crops, plenty of rain, and nature smiles in her mantle of green. We are looking forward to ^a^ visit of some of the brethren for our Sunday School and Quarterly Conferences with pleasure.  With daily prayers for the blessings of heaven upon you and yours, and an earnest desire that my communication will be received in the same spirit I have sought with prayer to pen it. I am ever your humble and devoted sister  in the gospel, Zina Young Card  see over. ENDENTRY In the absence of President Woodruff I would say that her views were quite correct on the subject, and  there is now doubt that proper arrangements will be made for preserving relics of a sacred character in the Temple, where it would seem they could be most properly cared for.

Woodruff end of sideways text ENDENTRY St. George, Utah Apr. 12, 1887  Mrs. Eliza R. Snow Smith,  Beloved Sister, Honored Lady, and Inspired Poetess—  While musing upon my exiled lonely bed last night, my thoughts turned on thee, and as I cannot visit you in person, I feel disposed to use my pen. I have been informed that you are in a low state of health and perhaps not likely to recover and a prospect of your closing your labors here in the flesh, and passing on to your labors upon the other side of the Veil, I thought if that was the case, I would like to communi- cate with you before you left. I felt that if there is an immortal spirit dwelling in a morta mortal body that can lie down in death in sweet repose, it is Sister Eliza. When I contemplate your life and labors of love to all classes of Latter-day Saints, the inspira- tion of your pen, which has cheered and encouraged Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles and Saints in the deepest hours of their afflictions, sorrows, persecutions and death, and the army of innocent children, the seed of Joseph, whose minds you have guided into paths of virtue, truth, and holiness, in the organizations of the Primaries and labor in the Sabbath Schools, Mutual Improvement Assoc., also your labors in the Relief Societies and  in the Assemblies of the Saints, and your ominous labor in Holy Places for the dead. And that you have passed through all the afflictions, tribulations, and persecution with the Saints and have dwelt in the flesh almost three generations, as man counts time, I say when I reflect upon these things, I feel that you, sister Eliza, an elect Lady of the Lord, can lay down your mortal body when the time comes without a sting, a pang or a regret and pass on to your work on the other side of the Veil to a far higher state of glory where you will find a host of Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles and Saints, as well as a large army of children who await your coming and will greet you with joy and rejoicing. I can say of a truth that your eye hath not seen, your ear heard, neither hath it entered into your heart to conceive the honor and glory that awaiteth you on the other side of the Veil. Through the blessing of God you have been enabled to create a name and fame that will never be forgotten through all time and eternity. Truly you will go down to the grave like a shock of corn fully ripe. When your spirit leaves your body you will find a host of friends to greet you who await your coming. I hope when I have finisehed my work I may be found worthy to meet with the same company that will greet you with joy. I feel that you can contemplate your change from mortality to immortality with rejoicing. Should you meet with that company of loyal friends, that Heavenly throng before I do, I have ab a boon to ask of you, that you will give my kind love to George and the hosts of brethren you will meet as well as those loyal sisters Phoebe, Margaret and t to the army of those faithful daughters of the Lord with whom we have both associated here on earth. As to myself, I have just passed my fourscore years, I am still in very good health, and as circumstances still deprive me of speaking in public to the living, I am trying to labor what I can for the dead. I met on the 2nd of March 125 friends in the Temple of the Lord, 73 of which got endowments for my dead. I addressed them for a short time. I was sealed while there for 73 couples of dead which makes about 3000 of my dead which I have done endowments and sealings for and which leaves me about 265 more to work for before I finish my record which I am in hopes to live to accomplish. I have had a great anxiety for the redemption of my dead while I dwell in the flesh. I met you in the Social Hall at the reception on your 80th birthday but I do not recall your present age. I do not wish to weary you with a lengthy communication, neither do I wish to trouble you with writing to me not knowing the state of your health, but should your brother Lorenzo be with you or any friend who could send me a few lines to let me know your state of health, it would be a consolation to me. I pray God to bless you with joy and peace during your remaining days and hours and when your hour of departure comes that you may die in the Lord and sleep in peace which is my earnest prayer.  Your Brother in the New and Everlasting Covenant.  (Signed, Wilford Woodruff  Any communication from any of my friends to me give to Historians' Office, it will reach me. W. W. ENDENTRY that room no longer without doubling our rent; so we gave it up and have held no meeting in Boston since. I opened my own hired house for meet- ings on Sunday and one evening in the week, which I have kept up to this day, except part of the time on Sunday at brother Bird's. I had full houses and I baptized a dozen or so. One was Mr. Snow and wife, a Uni- versalist, and a keeper of one of the engines; another was Andrew Delin, from Sweden, a smart man and one that I think will be useful in a future day, in carrying the Gospel to his own nation. Another was father Ezra Carter, Mrs. Woodruff's father. He was 78 years old, is smart, walked to the top of Bunker Hill monument with me. He is strong in the faith. I was truly glad to baptize him, as he has been believing for seven years Mrs. Woodruff feels that it amply pays her for coming to this country. Elder Salt Lake Valley, spent sev- eral days with me, and brought several of his relatives out to meeting. Father Carter spent about one month with me. Calvin I. Foss, son of sister Sarah B. Foss, also called upon me, and wished me to assist him in getting into a good company to go to the gold diggings; so after looking around, I got him into the Massachusetts Bay Store, Mining and Trading Company. He left for San Francisco on the ship Acrates, on the 5th of April. I sent letters and papers to you by him. He wrote from Rio Janeiro, was getting along well. I expect he will call upon you.

Appleby to start off for the Bluffs from Philadelphia, with a company of 80 Saint^s^ 50 from the Philadelphia Branch. He arrived at St. Louis all safe with all his family; baptized four of his family, three sons and one daughter, the day before he started. But when he arrived in St. Louis, the cholear^a^ was raging in all its horrors, from Galena, and up the state, slaying its thousands. Every steamer on all those rivers was pickled with the cholora, and officers, crews, and passengers were dying by scores. He went on board of the steamer Monroe, bound for St. Joseph's, with a company of soldiers or godl^d^ diggers, bound for California, and the cholera was on board when he went  on to it. About a hundred Saints went on with brother Appleby. By the ENDENTRY Mrs Emma S.

When the boat landed, all the crew that was left, with the passengers, fled int^o^ the city. It was reported in several letters that Elder Appleby was dead, but it was false. He slipped on board of another boat, and arriv- ed at the Bluffs with his family and the rest of the company, all well, and is now on his way to the valley, with a company. I sent all of my letters and papers on by him.  The cholera has been very fatal at St. Louis. They have had from one to two hundred deaths in that city daily by cholera, in a population of 50,000. There has been some 5000 deaths by cholera in that city in five weeks. It has swept all through Indepen- dence. It is said that 35,000 gold seekers, bound for San Francisco, have gone on to the plains to take the overland route via South Pass of the St. Joseph, Kanesville. The greatest number was at Inde- pendence. The papers say that the cholera was so bad in that town that the gold diggers all left in a fright, and did not stop to bury their dead, but piled them up in their winding sheets by the way side in heaps of five and six together, and the road was strewn with the dead, until it was awful and horrible in the extreme to behold; so say those who wit- nessed it. These companies had over 60,000 head of cattle and horses, and if the history of those companies does not tell a tale for the re- corder before they reach the gold diggings, then I am mistaken. Thous- ands of their cattle died before they got to the Black Hills, and many men, and some thousands, are returning back. Cholera has been fatal at Ill. About 5,000 deaths at New York. It has ranged in Boston from 10 to 78 deaths daily, 78 being the highest number. It is still all around us, but on the decrease.

Many noted men have fallen this summer by the cholera, among whom are President Worth, Col. Harding, Mrs. Taylor has been attacked, but got better. The chol^-^ era is also raging at the present time, through Paris, and most of Europe. Many deaths are on most of the emigrant ships now landing at New York. There has been but few deaths among the Saints, considering the many who have been among it. Capt. Liverpool in February with a fleet of six ships, with about 1500 Saints. All land^-^ ed safe at Council Bluffs in the midst of the worst time of the cholera. There was about fifty deaths out of the whole number, mostly on the Missouri River. Jones and Spen- cer are on their way to the valley. I do not know what success the Saints will have this season in crossing the mountains, as I should not think there would be grass enough through the Black Hills for the animals of the gold diggers alone to stand three tier deep upon. George A. Smith and E. T. Benson have gone with companies to the valley. Elder Hyde is left at the Bluffs, still printing the papers and counselling the people. The Saints at Pottawatomie Co. have escaped the cholera this season, while it has been all around them. Sanducky City, Ohio, had a population of 4,000, was entirely depopulated with the cholera, until  there was not 400 left; every doctor, lawyer and priest in the place, with most of the population, died. There was none to attend to the sick or bury the dead, and the last account, many remained in their houses un- buried. There have been many calamities taking place in the States since you left. A mob of some 20,000 gathered at the Astor Place The- atre, broke in the doors and windows, was fired upon by the military, 25  killed, 50 wounded. Large mobs in Philadelphia once a month, more or less killed. More than one half of the business part of the City of St. Louis, Mo, is laid in ashes. It burned 600 ^six^ hundred stores and dwellings, all the insurance offices, five banking houses, telegraph office, 25 steam boats, and a loss of six million ($6,000,000) dollars. They have had another fire since; several steam boats and dwellings burned; a mob raised; some lives lost; the cholera followed the fire, and laid its thousands in the grave.

Your Brother in the field  W Woodruff ENDENTRY broke away this spring, and New Orleans has been under water more than a month, and the loss of property been immense. Watertown, New York, is burned up. Also $60,000 worth of Milwa^u^kie is also burned, and large fires in almost every town; many fires in you left. I have just returned from a mission of two months in Mir- amichi, Nova Scotia, andc., and I have seen two hundred miles square of those provinces either burned over this spring or burning while I was there. Such fires were never known in that country. No rain in that country from April to August, and the fires got into the forest, and burned hundreds of miles over, sweeping fences, dwellings, barns, mill^s^, lumber yards, towns, cities, andc., all before it, in some in- stances driving the entire population on to the beach or into the sea. It seems as though nearly the whole country was ruined, and the fires not bringing trouble enough, the people have risen in mobs, burned the Par- liament houses, and government property, stoned and egged the Governor, and the people seem bent on burning up everything that is left, and kill- ing each other. The day before I got to St. John's a company of Orange men were marching in procession, were stoned by the Catholics, a fight ensued; about twenty were killed and twice that number wounded. They fought with stones, clubs, rifles, muskets, andc. I was on the ground on the occasion, and the doors and windows were riddled with bullets and slugs. The people were much excited the day I was there. I found the whole country through which I travelled in a horrid state; the people in  a state of starvation. No business going on; all trying to go to the states for better. The people were leaving with their packs on their backs. I had a hard journey through that country; was sick part of the time. I spent one week very pleasantly with Capt. Joseph Russell, of Miramichi. He owns the whole Island he is on; has expended some $30,00^0^ in buildings; says he will sell the whole at auction on the 5th of Sep- tember if he does not get ^£^50 for it. He has three new ships not sold, about 700 tons each, which he will sell in Liverpool market; will go from valley one year from next spring.

Brother Prince Edward's Island. We called upon John Maxfield; both have large farms, but cannot sell them for anything. John Maxfield's mills have shared the fate of others in that country, been burned to the ground by the sweeping fires; they saved their dwellings. Property in the prov- inces will hardly bring cash at any price at the present time, and pros- pect of it being worse. I ordained William Maxfield an Elder, and ap- pointed him to preside over the branch there, of 32 members. There are but four members left in sis- ter Foss not to depend upon the fifty dollars left ba^y^ Giddle, until you returned, for I did not think your family ought to be troubled with it while you were gone. I did not find but few Saints in that country. Brother Russell made particular enquiry about your welfare. Sister Bad- lam may have named to you, in her last letter, that sister Bride died of late at ^Sabra^ Granger when she died. Sister Sayers is well and gone to the valley.  I had an interview, while at Thomas Brown, from Bluffs, and one lady of Jones. Bro. Brown sent up 10,000 dollars worth of goods to the Bluffs. When he left they were baptizing about 1,000 per month in that land. There has been some terrible ship wrecks on the Atlantic this season. Two ships de- stroyed by icebergs; 60 froze to death in one night on the ice. Anoth- er vessel about 200 lives lost. The last trip of the Europa had a col- lission with a Boston ship loaded with emigrants; the ship sank in four minutes, 134 lost, 50 killed in the concussion. Many steamboat disas- ters, and many lives lost on the lakes and rivers, and many railroad dis- asters. You recollect Sidney Roberts writing a letter to you. He palmed himself off on the churches as being sent to collect money for the poor. He collected several hundred dollars, got $70 out of the small branch in Fair Haven, Ct.

The signs of the times are big with events at the present day. As concerning your family since you have been gone, I will say I think they have got along very well, as far as I know; they have mostly had good health. Alexander was attacked very suddenly with vom- iting and other sickness. I administered to him by anointing of oil, laying on of hands and prayer. He was well next day. I dont know of any other sickness in the family. I have been gone from home so much, I have not been able to call upon them as much as I would like to. When- ever I have had an opportunity I have enquired into their circumstances. I do not think they have had an opportunity of selling but very little varnish since you went away. I told sister Badlam to let me know her wants, and I would divide with her. My means has been very limited this season. I have had as much as I could do to meet my rent, get bread for my family, and pay my travelling bills. She has never called upon me for means, only in two or three instances, and then for a little change. I have always given double the amount called for, and the whole of it put together would hardly have bought a breakfast at San Francisco. A few days since she called for twenty five cents, and Mrs. Woodruff gave her fifty cents, and I gave her $5.00. I wish it had been a hundred, for I have no doubt that they needed it, but he that has not got cannot give. Phebe Foss, Mrs. Woodruff's nieces, who are at our house, attended, as Mary was going away on a visit for a while down to Mc.Clare has conveyed an idea to me that he intended to assist your family while you were gone, but do not expect that he has done much yet, except perhaps attending to some bill or two which was due.

Dear Sisters:  The labors which devolve upon Sister Zina in the Temple and those connected with the presidency of the Relief Society, prompt us, in consideration of her advanced age, to suggest that she should have some active help in answering correspondence she receives from the various branch societies throughout the Church. Sister Zina Y. Card is visiting here for the present, and we think she would be very suitable to act as her mother's private secretary to attend to her correspondence and other labors connected therewith, that you, and all of you, may be relieved as far as possible from these duties that are so onerous upon you at your time of life.  Trusting that this suggestion of ours, whiCch is made solely in the interest of the Relief Society and to benefit each and all of you, will be received in the spirit in which it is offered, and praying the Lord to bless you in all your labors, and to preserve your lives, we remain, with kindest regards,  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo.

Aug 20th 1892  Prest Wilford Woodruff— Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother—I have no disire to increase your burdens God knows you have enough to bear, but I have been much exercised concerning a few points contained in Bro. Roberts lecture ^which he^ delivered before the Mutual Im- provement Asson on authority of Priesthood.  I quote a few of eseveral items which have come to my mind, and in all that I say I desire to give no offence to my brethren in any particular. I can not say there is one iota of untruth contained in the lecture, but in my judgement the lecturer does not ex- plain, sufficiently, points of vital importance. These ^points^ "are a double signifficance at this period of political excitement; and ^the^ puting forth "liberal" ideas ^in political matters^ which have brought our Republic to the verge of desolution, and will ^yet^ prove an important factors in the ultimate overthrow of man made governments, vis perfect freedom faded textie, debauch, the stronger oppress the weak, the rich grow richer the poor grow poorer; the spirit shrink and the body enlarge its beastly propensities, are distressing to contemplate.

I have always bileived that, when, when Christs author ized servants have it revealed unto them that a certain man was the individual to preside over the Church—His church, this might be sustained, but not revoked by His peoples. I have the privilege of showing to God and man that, I am in harmony with that revelation and my sign of Cove- nant is the evidence, which I can produce on the spot, of my unswerving allegiance to Him. All things are done by common consent which comes through obedience to the Lord.  "Joseph presided over the church by the voice of the people." Very true. And the people were the church of Christ because they sustained His prophet, which  is equally true.  "Joseph presided over the church etc." "The people chose to have it so." "He always filled that station by the voice of the people." These statements are all true but I think that, with^out^ further explenation they are calculated to mis- lead the minds of our children. If it is deemed wisdom to leave these things as they are as they appear in print, I am content. Please render me a little assistance to put the break on with a little mode more force.  "Ecclesiastical governments as well as civil derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." I am in- clined to think that, there is a destinction between to the ^two^ govern- ments. God calls and authorizes a man, he gathers the people and they sustani sustain him. Men gather and appoint ^or elect^ their head. One originates in God, the other in man.

ENDENTRY In comparison God has a fine stepper properly harness to his ^illegible^ to assist the brethen; while man has nothing but a push cart. True, majorities controle in the world and they ^the wicked^ will seek to push this doctrine upon us, on purpose to destroy the church. I know their cunning is not equal to the wisdom of God, and I pray for strength to stand when these two powers will, apparently, as nearly lie that the boldest will tremble in the conflict. A bare majority of the people may reject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con- genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receiving office on the line through which revelation can come to them. The mi- nority who sustain the prophet by their votes, are all that is left of the church of Christ.  The agency of man consists in his having ^had^ power delegated to him to select his master. I exercise my will power by being obedient to the chosen of the Lord. I beleive our youth should be taught to sustain the authorities of the church irrespective of of numbers. I fix my eyes upon you; I listen to your counsel, I try to live to have the same spirit that actuates you. The testimony of the spirit in me is that your mistakes—should you make any—will be overruled by God for His glory and the good of His people. I beseech the Father to give me strength to follow you as you follow Christ our Lord. Will the time ever come when a majority of those claiming mem- bership in the church—whatever object they have had in forming the church—will reject the Presidency and apostles by vote in the general assembly of the people. I beleive the devil has that little game on foot— that it, the idea, exists in the hearts of men to day.  I am content to leave things as they are for now I feel better. If I have hurt your feelings in any wise forgive me. I could not rest until I had chatted with the presidency.  I strive to do my duty in my weak way. In contrast with the brightness of the more faithful elders, there is much of the old fogy in me I find.  Love to the brethren. God bless you dear brother I am yours in Christ.
