While in the penitentiary I formed the ac-  quaintance of a country man of mine, who  was being held on ^a^ charge of illegal voting, who  had traveled much in many countries, and who  had been in Central and South America, and  spent some years in Guatemala, which is the most  northern of the five Central American Republics,  containing something over 40,000 qr. miles, with a  population of about 1 1/2 millions. The climate is  tropical, but quite healthy as a rule, as the country  consists mainly of table-lands of different alti-  tudes.  The soil is very fertile, and produces in  profution a great variety of tropical fruits,  bananas, bread-fruit, plantain, sarsaparilla,  mahogany, logwood &c. Sugar cane and coffee  are cultivated. When cane is planted once, it  grows for ten years, producing two crops a year.  Coffee is a profitable product for exportation.  There are some rail-roads, one running through  Guatemala from the Caribian Sea to the Pacific

 Ocean. Gold and silver mines are aboundant, though  but little worked. In Guademala the mines are  owned by the government, but can be leased for  one third. In Honduras, mines can be located  and claimed like in the United States. Nicaragua  is the largest of the five republics, having an area  of 58,000 Sq. miles, with only about 400,000 in-  habitants. The governments of those countries hold  out great inducements to white settlers, giving 120  acres of land with one yoke of oxen, one plow, such  as they have them, three cows to a man, and if he  is married he gets six cows. Seven years settlement  is required to aquire government title to the land.  Much of the government land has already crops  growing; such as bananas, sarsaparilla, mahogany  trees &c., for which there is always a market.  There  is no import duty, but "Free Trade."   There, is a  country already made, with many facilities awayi  thing the enterprice and progressiveness of the Anglo-  Saxon race, and it is probable that greater induce-  ments would be offered for colonyization, as I  read in the papers not long ago that a company  of capitalists from Rhroad Island had got a  large tract of land in Honduras, with several  miles of sea coast, where they purpus raising and  exporting tropical fruits &c. The price of labor is high,  as the natives can not see the philosophy in working  where they can get every thing they need without  work.

 The greater part of the population constists of  Indians and mestizos. The whites are Spanish as  a rule. The Indians are superior to the Mexicans  in appearance, but are indolent and non progress-  ive, and no interest is taken in church or school,  still, some of the Government Officials are well  educated and con speak several languages.    In South America are some fine countries  also. The Argentine Republic is a very large  country with a mild climate something like that  of California, and the soil is very productive. A  few years ago the government of that country offered  to every family, who would come and settle per-  manently, 600 acres of land and a horse team  with harness, wagon and such farming imp-  lements as they have. There are quite a number  of Europeans there, engaged in agriculture and  stock raising; but the great majority of the population  in all those countries are Lamanites, a people in  whome we as Latter-day Saints have reason to  feel much interested, and among whom we  understand is a great work to be performed  in the near future.    There are some disadvantages, of course,  in those countries, the main one being the un-  stableness of the governements; but it is dificult  perhaps to find a government enywheres now  whose stability can be dependet upon, that of  our own nation not excepted.

Will say my pecuniary situation  was briefly stated in my reply to   Pres.

 Payson, Utah, June 3rd 1891    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,    Salt Lake,    Dear Brother,    I am in receipt of a communication from  Sec. Geo. Reynolds, on behalf of ^the^ Missionary   Committee of the Apostles saying, with refer-  ence to my being called on a mission and re-  garding my present pecuniary condition,  they do not wish me to make too great a sac-  rifice to answer to said call, and that "they are  entirely willing that I should take the time I feel  necessary to straighten up my affairs." In   answer will say I am thankful for the   offer, but I reason thus: The call or requirement   is from the Lord, through proper authority;   It is my business to respond, and the  Lord's business to help me so I can per-  form what He has required of me.   On receiving the Call, I set about at once   to arrange my affairs to this end, "relying on   His omnipotent Providence," as stated in   my former letter, and, though my finan-  cial condition is, at present, embarrassing,   yet I have hope and faith that all "can   be placed in such shape that I can  leave honorably".    I have, therefore, concluded to report  to you that, God being my Helper and,  "should there be no reasonable obstacles

 There is steam boat comunication between those  countries and the United States, both east and west,  and also with the rest of the world, and when the  contemplated Inter-continental rail road shall  have been completed, the distance bethween here  and there will not seem so great.    I have been led to interest my self in  getting all the information I could conserning  those countries and people, because many like  my self are in jeopardy here all the time on  account of our large families, and are forced  to seek homes elsewhere, where the laws are more  humane, spend our time in the "Pen", or abandon  our families.  We were informed by the Prophet  Joseph Smith that both North and South America  is the land of Zion, and President Brigham  Young said many years ago that settlements of  the saints would be extended all the way down  into South America. President John Taylor  said, or the Lord through him said: Let the  Seventies prepare themselves to go and preach  the Gospel to those people, and let the High Priests  prepare them selves to go and preside among them.    I do not expect in presenting these views  and ideas, which are based upon information,  that the Church Authorities will consider that  as a suficient inducement for imediate colon-  ization, but if the advisability of extending
