There is another advantage to be  gained by useing an electrict power, for driving machinery of this Kind.

Deir Brethern:  Nearly fife years ago I was called to go on a Mission to Germany, but after explaining my circumstances I was honerable released.  Two years ago I was again called, this time to the Northern States Mission and after explaining again my circumstanses I was again honerable released for the time being, but was advised by you to prepare and report myself as soon as I was ready to go.  I have worked hard in that direction and with the Blessings of the Lord I am now able to say that my debts will be paid shortly and my Familie left so they can make a Living without a great eal of Help from the Bishop or Ward in which I live.  I started a small Dairy (Cheesedairy) last Spring and ifthe Bishop says, he will assist them in getting some share Cens to milk during the Summerseason and with that and a One half Income of from about 15 head of Stock of my own I think they can economicaly pull through.  My biggest drawbacks are: No money to go with and pay my way espeshially if you should now again send me to Europe (I have no Choise) To the Northern States it would not cost as much and could raise money to go there in less time, but to raise Money to go to Europe I dont see how I could raise it in much less than a year, and if I stay another year at home I will be able to prepare still better for  my Familie.
