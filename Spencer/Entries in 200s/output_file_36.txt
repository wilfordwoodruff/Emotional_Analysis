The climate istropical, but quite healthy as a rule, as the countryconsists mainly of table-lands of different alti-tudes.  The soil is very fertile, and produces inprofution a great variety of tropical fruits,bananas, bread-fruit, plantain, sarsaparilla,mahogany, logwood &c. Sugar cane and coffeeare cultivated. When cane is planted once, itgrows for ten years, producing two crops a year.Coffee is a profitable product for exportation.There are some rail-roads, one running throughGuatemala from the Caribian Sea to the Pacific

 Ocean. Gold and silver mines are aboundant, thoughbut little worked. In Guademala the mines areowned by the government, but can be leased forone third. In Honduras, mines can be locatedand claimed like in the United States. Nicaraguais the largest of the five republics, having an areaof 58,000 Sq. miles, with only about 400,000 in-habitants. The governments of those countries holdout great inducements to white settlers, giving 120acres of land with one yoke of oxen, one plow, suchas they have them, three cows to a man, and if heis married he gets six cows. Seven years settlementis required to aquire government title to the land.Much of the government land has already cropsgrowing; such as bananas, sarsaparilla, mahoganytrees &c., for which there is always a market.  Thereis no import duty, but "Free Trade."   There, is acountry already made, with many facilities awayithing the enterprice and progressiveness of the Anglo-Saxon race, and it is probable that greater induce-ments would be offered for colonyization, as Iread in the papers not long ago that a companyof capitalists from Rhroad Island had got alarge tract of land in Honduras, with severalmiles of sea coast, where they purpus raising andexporting tropical fruits &c. The price of labor is high,as the natives can not see the philosophy in workingwhere they can get every thing they need withoutwork.

 The greater part of the population constists ofIndians and mestizos. The whites are Spanish asa rule. The Indians are superior to the Mexicansin appearance, but are indolent and non progress-ive, and no interest is taken in church or school,still, some of the Government Officials are welleducated and con speak several languages.In South America are some fine countriesalso. The Argentine Republic is a very largecountry with a mild climate something like thatof California, and the soil is very productive. Afew years ago the government of that country offeredto every family, who would come and settle per-manently, 600 acres of land and a horse teamwith harness, wagon and such farming imp-lements as they have. There are quite a numberof Europeans there, engaged in agriculture andstock raising; but the great majority of the populationin all those countries are Lamanites, a people inwhome we as Latter-day Saints have reason tofeel much interested, and among whom weunderstand is a great work to be performedin the near future.There are some disadvantages, of course,in those countries, the main one being the un-stableness of the governements; but it is dificultperhaps to find a government enywheres nowwhose stability can be dependet upon, that ofour own nation not excepted.

Will say my pecuniary situationwas briefly stated in my reply to Pres. Gates and will not tire you with a re-iteration of same, but will here only state that, though fi-nancially in an embarrassing con-dition at present, with a family of small children (four in number alive, the oldest 7 1/2, the youngest 1 1/2 years old,) still I feel that the Lord is able to open up ways and provide means least thought ofby weak mortals, and, relying on His omnipotent Providence, I hope all can be placed in shape that I can leave honorably. Inspirit I feel, at present, having been called from the right source, to obey, and, notwithstanding Ikeenly realize my own weaknessesand imperfections as a man forsuch labor, yet I feel to go, and 
 Payson, Utah, June 3rd 1891Prest. Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake,Dear Brother,I am in receipt of a communication fromSec. Geo. Reynolds, on behalf of ^the^ Missionary Committee of the Apostles saying, with refer-ence to my being called on a mission and re-garding my present pecuniary condition,they do not wish me to make too great a sac-rifice to answer to said call, and that "they areentirely willing that I should take the time I feelnecessary to straighten up my affairs." In answer will say I am thankful for the offer, but I reason thus: The call or requirement is from the Lord, through proper authority; It is my business to respond, and theLord's business to help me so I can per-form what He has required of me. On receiving the Call, I set about at once to arrange my affairs to this end, "relying on His omnipotent Providence," as stated in my former letter, and, though my finan-cial condition is, at present, embarrassing, yet I have hope and faith that all "can be placed in such shape that I canleave honorably".I have, therefore, concluded to reportto you that, God being my Helper and,"should there be no reasonable obstacles

 There is steam boat comunication between thosecountries and the United States, both east and west,and also with the rest of the world, and when thecontemplated Inter-continental rail road shallhave been completed, the distance bethween hereand there will not seem so great.I have been led to interest my self ingetting all the information I could conserningthose countries and people, because many likemy self are in jeopardy here all the time onaccount of our large families, and are forcedto seek homes elsewhere, where the laws are morehumane, spend our time in the "Pen", or abandonour families.  We were informed by the ProphetJoseph Smith that both North and South Americais the land of Zion, and President BrighamYoung said many years ago that settlements ofthe saints would be extended all the way downinto South America. President John Taylorsaid, or the Lord through him said: Let theSeventies prepare themselves to go and preachthe Gospel to those people, and let the High Priestsprepare them selves to go and preside among them.I do not expect in presenting these viewsand ideas, which are based upon information,that the Church Authorities will consider thatas a suficient inducement for imediate colon-ization, but if the advisability of extending
