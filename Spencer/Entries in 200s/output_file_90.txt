Immediately after entering the house in com pany with several other Elders, I went within the veil and we bowed down before the Lord in the aronic stand and offer'd a morning sacrifice, and the Spirit of God rested upon us with joy to our souls. I was called upon, by the Patriarch Book of Mormon; I then read the ##Jacob 5|third chapter## of the Book of Jacob, which contains the house of Israel as was spake by the Prophet Zenos. The same God that touched Isaiah's lips with hallowed fire, gave Zenos great wisdom in setting forth this parable. After I had made some brief remarks upon the subject the congregation took their seats for the services of the day, in the following order. The house being divided into four parts by veils, the females occupied two parts and the males the others, some of the presidency presided in each appartment The time was taken up during the day in each appart ment in singing, exortation, and prayer, some had a tongue, others an interpetation, and all was in order. The power of GOD rested upon the people the gifts were poured out upon us some had the administering of angels and the image of GOD sat upon the countenances of the Sants. at 4 oclock PM the veils were all rolled up together which brought the whole congregation in full view of each other and while the presence of the LORD filled the house the congregation of the saints fell upon their knees and all as one man, vocally poured forth rejoicing, supplication and Prayer, before the God of Israel which closed the services of the day, after contributing for the support of the poor  FIGURE {may move my spirit in my God he long illegible the blessings in the illegible while the man gladdens the shades of night the} ever {illegible of man when the center to his soul and interest vibrate his mind into with peculiar sensations not expressed with those that cause with myself while the} amicitia {of a Saint.}FIGURE ENDENTRY March 26, 1837 ~ Sunday   March 26th Sunday communed with the saints in the fore part of the day.

I have spent the time for several days past in perusing the outlines of ancient and modern HISTORY on a new plan, By Rev Royal Robbins. It strikes the reflecting mind with deep sensibility to contemplate the scenery of the rise, progress, decline and fall of the Nations and kingdoms of the earth from the days of ADAM untill 1837 years aft^er^ Christ. And it is equally inter esting to contemplate the day that is now at hand and hath already begun in fulfillment of ancient prophecy in bringing the church of Christ out of the wilderness in esstablishing Israel upon those lands by a Theocratical government in fulfillment of the conenants God made with Abram Isaac and Jacob. As this hath began in my day and I am called to act a part in the work by being plaaced with the first seventy Elders of Israel to become a special witness of Jesus Crist to all nations I need much faith fortitude, holiness, and wisdom. May the Lord enable me not to seek honour from man but God and be faithful in clearing my garments of the blood of gentile and Jew and do honour to the  annointing that now awaiteth me   ENDENTRY April 3, 1837 ~ Monday   April 3rd The day had now arived for preperations for the annointing and the endowment of the Elders of Israel or at least for those that were not endowed in Kirtland the strong hold of the daughter of Zion in the spring of 1836 and as I was absent at that time my day is now come and my time at hand for those blessings and I shall record the events of each day of the endowment for the benefit of the generation to come. I upon this third day of April met in the house of the Lord with a number of the seventies to receiev counsel respecting our washing and anointing. I was appointed with Elder F. G. Williams and have the perfumes and oil prepared against the day following I consider'd it a privilege to wait upon the Elders of Israel in this thing that we might become the annointed of the Lord according to the words of the Poet and the Revelations of JESUS CHRIST   We'll wash and be washed and with oil be anointed Withal not omit the washing of feet For he that receiveth his PENNY appointed Must surely be clean at the hearvest of wheat After attending to the duties above spoken I repaired to a room in company with Elder Meeks and Priest J Turpin to attend to our first washing after washing our bodies from head to foot in soap and watter we then washed ourselves in clear watter next in perfumed spirits the spirit of God was with us and we had a spiritual time. We spent the evening with several Elders in Prayer before God and the Power of God rested upon us.  ENDENTRY April 4, 1837 ~ Tuesday   April 4th I met at the house of Elder Hales at one ^1^ oclock PM. in company with twenty three Elders President Joseph Young making one of the number for the purpose of attending to the ordinance of washing the body with clean watter and perfumes that our bodies might be prepared for the anointing. President Young opened the meeting by prayer we then proceded to the ordinance myself and Elder G. W. Meeks were the first washed under   ENDENTRY the hands of President Joseph Young we then assisted President Young in washing our Brethren the Elders much of the spirit of God rested upon us I washed and perfumed the bodies of a number of my Brethren and the interview closed after after expressing our feelings to each other. We again met together in the quorum of the sev enties at the upper part of the Lords house at early candle light to receieve our anointing. The quorums of the Deacons, Teachers, and Priest occupied one apartment the Elders another and the seventies the third. each quorums met for the anointing. Three of the presidents met with the seventies viz H Aldrich J. Young and Z. Coultrin President Coultrin opened the meeting by prayer and after conversing plainly to those who were to be anointed they proceded to business the presidency consecrated the oil before God that it might be holy. The person to be anointed then took a seat and the presidency then laid hands upon his head  and consecrated him unto God and then anointed him in the name of the Lord and pronounced such blessings upon his his head as the testimony of Jesus shall direct which is the spirit of prophecy.   We had a glorious season indeed in this solumn ordinance of the house of the Lord there were fifteen annointed in our quorum mostly by President Coultrin the power of God rested upon us.   President Coultrin anointed me and the following are some of the blessing that he pronounced upon my head while clothed upon by the Power of God, viz. that God would bless me with all the powers of the priesthood and give me a multiplicity of blessing that kings would tremble upon their thrones at my word, that I should become a counsellor and multitudes should seek cou nsel at my mouth and I should have great wisdom   ENDENTRY and power to fly through the midst under heaven as Philip travled by the spirit, that I should have power over my enemies and have long life to bring many into the kingdom of God ##Acts 8:39## Also that I should have the riches of the earth and that I should have sons and consecrate them priests unto God in zion and that I should tread upon the ashes of my enemies in Jackson County they that had sought to take my life and the life of my breth ren that went to redeem zion and he also sealed upon my head all the blessing that had previously been pronounced upon me and thes blessing were sealed upon my head with a loud amen from all of the anointed present in the name of Jesus Christ  Much of the spirit of God and a sens of the virtue of the ordinance rested upon me May God enable me to possess those blessing and obtain those vishions that have been promised me in this and other solumn ordinances and keep me from dish- onouring my anointing and the Holy Priesthood for Christ Sake amen   The interview closed about 10 o' clock P.M. I then repaired into the lower court of the Joseph B. Nobles and G. W. Meeks to spend the night (after being anointed) in prayer and fasting before God the vales being closed we entered the Elders pulpit and there upon our knees we ple^a^d with God and we covenanted with each other in the holy stand that we would not give sleep to our eyes neither take food untill we receieved a blessing from God by the outpourings of his spirit upon us if it was untill the end of three days and according to our covenant we commenced praying and a part of the night we had a severe trial of our faith by great temptation from Satan but before day we gained a good degree of victory over the Devil and the Lord poured out his spirit upon us and we felt it good to be in the house of   ENDENTRY God while nature was hushed in silenced by the sable shades of night. After spending the night in prayer we returned to our homes in the morning intending to spend the day in prayer and fasting for still greater blessings this being upon    ENDENTRY April 5, 1837 ~ Wednesday   April 5th I spent a part of the day in attending the high council the remainder in writing, prayer and  fasting I again repaired to the upper ^lower^ part of the house of the Lord at 5 oclock PM. with the quorum of the seventies for a solumn assembly anointing andc. Three out of the seven presidents were present and anointed twelve the spirit of God sat upon us and we were satisfied with our blessing conseque- ntly I returned home with those brethren with whom I had covenanted for a blessing and took some food and retired to rest being 24 hours since we had taken food or sleep. There was much of the spirit of prophesy and revelation poured upon the heads of the anointed in the diferent quorums    ENDENTRY April 6, 1837 ~ Thursday   April. 6.th FIGURE 1837. This being more part- icular the day of the solumn assembly, or a day that is looked upon an^n^ually with feeling of greater interest in celebration of the 6th of April 1830 as upon that day the church of Latter day Saints was first organized in this fulness of times Henceforth the solumn assembly of the Elders of Israel and all official members that can, will meet in the LORDS house annually to attend to the most solumn ordinances of the house of GOD and of receiev- ing the visions and great things of heavens Therefore  I shall be more particular in recording the transact ions of this day than others for it is sumthing simil ar to the Pentecost that St Jerrusalem   I repaired to the house of the Lord at 8 oclock A.M. and after spending an hour in the lower part of the house the presidency of the church   ENDENTRY called the quorums of the seventies into the upper part of the house that they might be by themselves for awhile as there was some business to be attended to in these quorums before they could procede to the business of the day below. In the first place six of the presidents of the seventies were to leave the seventies and take a station in the quorum of the travling high priest hood and six other Presidents chosen in their stead I shall not here give the particulars of this change of councillers Suffice it to say that all of the Joseph Young were high priest befor the organization of the seventies and they had a right to officiate in the lower offices of the Church and there was some difiference in the authority and office of the quorums of high priesthood and seventies.   The six new Presidents chosen out of the seventies to take the place of thos that were to leave were Salmon Gee, blank John Gaylard.   After this matter was aranged theire was a glorious ordinance performed upon the heads of those who had been anointed (by the first presidency of the Church Sidney Rigdon andc was this ordinance performed. it was as follows. while all of the anointed present lifted there hands towards heaven this first presidency of the Church confirmed and sealed upon our heads all the blessings of our ordination, anointing, and Patriarchal with a seal in the presence of God and the Lamb and holy angels that they should all be fulfilled upon our heads that not one jot or tittle should fail and the seal was confirmed upon our heads with a shout of all the anointed with uplifted hand to heaven HOSANNA.
