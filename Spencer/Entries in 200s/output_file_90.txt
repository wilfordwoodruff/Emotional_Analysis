 Springville Utah Feb 8th 1898To the First Presidency of the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day SaintsDear BrethrenThe editorial article concerning theWord of Wisdom in the Juvenile Instructor of Jan 1sthas made a deep impression on our minds. Throughthe inspirations of the Spirit and after fasting andunitedly seeking the Lord we have been led to addressto you this testimonial.Testifying, that as members of the Church of JesusChrist, as heads of families, and as members of thePhysiological Reform Association, we do keep theWord of Wisdom. That this Association is the outgrowthof Sister Hannah Sorensen's teachings; that, thoughwe believed and sought to practice the word of wisdomprevious to our knowledge of her and her work, yetthrough her teachings we were shown a simple andpractical way of living it. Her teachings are allin harmony with the Word of Wisdom; in fact, if we may use the illustration, the word of wisdom asrevealed through the Prophet Joseph and taughtby our beloved leaders today, is but the skeletonof the perfect form which her teachings clotheand make so gloriously beautiful. Through thelabors of the dear humble sister our lives have been made better and purer and since practicingher teachings we have had more joy in servingthe Lord.We take pleasure in testifying of her worth,her purity and simplicity of life, her

 humility and dependence upon the Lord;and we dare affirm that in the localitieswhere she has taught these classes, there willbe found the majority of members of the churchwho are observing the Word of Wisdom.In our humble way we are trying toteach others this beautiful way of living butone of the greatest difficulties we haveencountered is the sentiment that our authorities do not publicly encourage thiswork. However we remember with muchpleasure and satisfaction every word ofencouragement you have given us.In conclusion. dear brethren, we testifyto our sincere appreciation of your laborsand our sympathy for you in your arduousduties; that we eagerly listen to your counselsand strive to make them a part of our dailylives. We rejoice in being participants inthis great latterday work and our daily prayersare for you and the welfare of Zion.We wish to say that we are much gratifiedin thus addressing you and we do this,not in the pride of our hearts, but ingratitude and humility before God andsubscribe ourselves your brothers andsisters in the Gospel of our Lord
