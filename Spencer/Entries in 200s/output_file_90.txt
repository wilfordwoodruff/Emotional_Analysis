I have spent the time for several days past in perusing the outlines of ancient and modern HISTORY on a new plan, By Rev Royal Robbins. It strikes the reflecting mind with deep sensibility to contemplate the scenery of the rise, progress, decline &amp; fall of the Nations and kingdoms of the earth from the days of ADAM untill 1837 years aft^er^ Christ. And it is equally inter esting to contemplate the day that is now at hand &amp; hath already begun in fulfillment of ancient prophecy in bringing the church of Christ out of the wilderness in esstablishing Israel upon those lands by a Theocratical government in fulfillment of the conenants God made with Abram Isaac &amp; Jacob. As this hath began in my day &amp; I am called to act a part in the work by being plaaced with the first seventy Elders of Israel to become a special witness of Jesus Crist to all nations I need much faith fortitude, holiness, &amp; wisdom. May the Lord enable me not to seek honour from man but God &amp; be faithful in clearing my garments of the blood of gentile &amp; Jew and do honour to the  annointing that now awaiteth me   ENDENTRY April 3, 1837    for the annointing &amp; the endowment of the Elders of Israel or at least for those that were not endowed in Kirtland the strong hold of the daughter of Zion in the spring of 1836 &amp; as I was absent at that time my day is now come &amp; my time at hand for those blessings &amp; I shall record the events of each day of the endowment for the benefit of the generation to come.
