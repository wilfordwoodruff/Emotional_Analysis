At present I can't  see exacly where the means are coming from.  Of course my family is small. I have a wife and   one child. She can go home and live with her   folks, and if I can see our furniture and what  few other things weI have, and wihit what help  I have been promised from the Ward, with the  helpf of the GoLord I will go. I feel that I should  not withhold any sacrifice that ^is^ asked of me by   authority of the Priesthood. I shall notify you if  any thing should happen to prevent my going. My  desure is to do good and to be a faithful worker in   Zion. Hoping this will be satisfactory, I remain  Your brother in the Gosple, Nathan Miller.    Edwin Fullmer Bp

 Springville Utah Feb 8th 1898    To the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints    Dear Brethren    The editorial article concerning the  Word of Wisdom in the Juvenile Instructor of Jan 1st  has made a deep impression on our minds. Through  the inspirations of the Spirit and after fasting and  unitedly seeking the Lord we have been led to address  to you this testimonial.    Testifying, that as members of the Church of Jesus  Christ, as heads of families, and as members of the  Physiological Reform Association, we do keep the  Word of Wisdom. That this Association is the outgrowth  of Sister Hannah Sorensen's teachings; that, though  we believed and sought to practice the word of wisdom  previous to our knowledge of her and her work, yet  through her teachings we were shown a simple and  practical way of living it. Her teachings are all  in harmony with the Word of Wisdom; in fact, if   we may use the illustration, the word of wisdom as  revealed through the Prophet Joseph and taught  by our beloved leaders today, is but the skeleton  of the perfect form which her teachings clothe  and make so gloriously beautiful. Through the  labors of the dear humble sister our lives have been   made better and purer and since practicing  her teachings we have had more joy in serving  the Lord.    We take pleasure in testifying of her worth,  her purity and simplicity of life, her

 humility and dependence upon the Lord;  and we dare affirm that in the localities  where she has taught these classes, there will  be found the majority of members of the church  who are observing the Word of Wisdom.    In our humble way we are trying to  teach others this beautiful way of living but  one of the greatest difficulties we have  encountered is the sentiment that our   authorities do not publicly encourage this  work. However we remember with much  pleasure and satisfaction every word of  encouragement you have given us.    In conclusion. dear brethren, we testify  to our sincere appreciation of your labors  and our sympathy for you in your arduous  duties; that we eagerly listen to your counsels  and strive to make them a part of our daily  lives. We rejoice in being participants in  this great latterday work and our daily prayers  are for you and the welfare of Zion.    We wish to say that we are much gratified  in thus addressing you and we do this,  not in the pride of our hearts, but in  gratitude and humility before God and  subscribe ourselves your brothers and  sisters in the Gospel of our Lord

 Salt Lake City  July 5, 1898    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother:    I am asked by  Elder Torkelsen to endorse his  answer to the call made  upon him to take a mission.  I can only say this, that  I know very little about him;  he has only recently come into   the 18th Ward, where he was  rebaptized a few weeks ago.  He also brought tithing receipts,  and a recommend from some  Elder in Scandinavia, I believe.  I have heard unfavorable reports  about him from Elder Jens S.  Jensen of the 18th Ward and   Bro. Olaf Andersen of the Bikuben  Office, but personally I know
