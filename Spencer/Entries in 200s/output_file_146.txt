March 16, 1848 ~ Thursday   16th I spent the day at home Brs Alread called upon me and spent the night with me. I walked out in the evening with President Whitehead council was given to them concerning emigration   ENDENTRY March 17, 1848 ~ Friday   17th March 1848 I spent the day at home I attended a  Council of much importance in the evening. The Captain of  the Policee with two others who were members of the Seventies  were brought before the Presidency of the Seventies for assault  and batterry and swearing. There was present but three of the  Presidents of the Seventies, but the High Council was present also  President Young and W Woodruff it was agreed by the parties to try the case before the High Council, which was filled up and the charges  read, the defendants did not exactly plead guilty so the testimony  was heard on both sides and it was proven there was a fight between them and swearing. The Plaintiff opened the subject called witne- sses who testifyed. The defendants spoke and bore their testimony the  Plaintiff then made his plea and also his councillor the defendants  then made their plea also their Councellor.   Then President  Young arose and addressed the council in an interesting manner  the following is an extract of the Clerks munites of the President  speech. If all parties are willing I will now make some remarks  there are a good many item pertaining to this case. 1st it was to be brought before the President of the 70, but they did not pro fess to have any Jurisdiction in the case ownly in the trial of  their membership but not as a peace officer. But the High  council can sit as a municipal court and try them for Church  fellowship and for a breach of duty as a Policee officer is it supp- osed that a public officer cannot do worgong wrong I do not  think so and when they do wrong they should be reproved as  well as any other person, I shall speak my mind without  any regard to parties favor or affection this I always calculate  to do whether I gain friends or foes I have plenty of enemies  But I dont ask any favors of them I will not be turned for  a moment out of the course of right and justice if it cuts my throat. I shall tell the truths some who have pled this cause dare not tell all the truth, if Mr Hill did tantilize the Policee they had no business to fall upon him and beat him. I have known Br Hill for fifteen years He is given to rough uncouth conversation  and tantalizing mens feelings, and he wont apostitize neither  Let me reason the case I am a teacher I often officiat in that  capacity. For instance Hosea Stout says that for 8 years he has  had a catalogue of names in his own mind of those who would  apostitize and as yet he had not been mistakened If a man under- stands the things of God, he knows well that every Saint of  God ifs followed up through life by the powers of Hell, of the devil  of temptation, and of evry snare that can be invented on the earth  to make him apostitize, loose his glory and crown, this I understand  If I see a man doing wrong or is any way faltering If I take a course  to make him believe that he will fall does not that at once weaken  his faith and disarm him of power to stand? it does, dont I see things  as well as the Policee I do and if I saw a man that I knew  would fall I would not tell him so but would try to save him as well as I could that when he did go my garments would be  clear before God and he could not rise in Judgment against me I am here to save both Br Hosea and Hill but not to destroy them  we are here to the Policee as policee and to inquire into their  conduct as Elders. Has not Isaac Hill been afflicted and maimed  who sent Hosea Stout to take Isaac Hill as a Prisioner Nobody   ENDENTRY was there disorder. Isaac Hill was out of ordor  to go into a store in the mids of a contention and undertake to tantili- ze a mans feelings while he was in anger under pretence of reproving  him for swearing A far better way would have been for him to have  waited untill he was calm and composed and took him one side and in a  friendly manner said Br Hosea I think your course in the store was  not calculated to dignify your office as Captain of the policee and as  a member of the Seventies he would then have recieved it vary  different from what he did. I know it is natural for Br Hill to tan- talize, but that is no excuse for Br Hosea Stout to fight him, he should  have said I am a peace maker and magnifyed his office with dignity  and honor but instead of that he desended to the spirit of a tantilizer  and fell to fighting and swearing. Policeemen should be men of more noble  minds than to desend to such things, or suffer their spirits to mingle  with such low degrading things, Hosea Stout did desend to anger and  swearing which was disgraceful to a Policee man and men that  will practice such things are not fit for policeeman I know the  policeemen here are not Just right for they will get together for  hours together make fun, toll tales, drick whiskey and get drunk and  that is why they are so angry all the while, and they dont pray when they come together if they did when they saw fighting and  contention they would do as John Lytle did when he parted Stout  and Hill says he (as he steped between them and shoved one one way and the  other the other way) get out of the way stop your fighting I am a peace maker and wont have it. I never struck a man in my life though  I have parted many who were fighting I never saw the day but that I thought to myself to good to strike a man. Now to the Policee I say stop your baldadash pray with each other now if I have not told  the truth tell me of it. I mean to reprove the Policee if we dont  get better men in the valley I will vote against them, they have  confessed they are angry I want to see the Police officiate in their office  without getting angry if they do not they disgrace their office. I  know how Brother Hosea Stout feels concerning the spirits that murdered the Prophets and still hang around us, but dont you know that devils  are going to the mountains as well as Saints, we have some of the mea- nest spirits among us on earth the net has halled in good and bad  and I am watching them continually, and we have some of the  best men with us that swear that are guilty of crime yet they wou- ld lay down their lives for us and for this cause, there are others who will not gather with the Saints because they think the church is not pure  enough for them and they think themselves vary pure and will wait untill  the Saints get pure Holy and righteous and during all this time they will  live with the world in the midst of wickedness of every kind and think  it all well. We have good men and bad men among us, but if I see a bad  man or good man that needs reproof I will give it to him but will  I go into a store and strike a man? no would it make him any better? No  but we should be saviors benovelent and kind and imitate the example  of the Savior. men ignorantly fan the flame of mobocracy I have  feelings about it, and often say cut his infernal throat still I do not me- an any such thing I am not good enough to do such a thing. The God of  Israel was a God of war when Israel went over the read sea and the  enemies followed the Lord commanded the waters to overflow them  and it obeyed when I get good enough then I can fight to If I have  power to command the elements. Isaac Hill ought to have known better  than to have done as he did he is no more fit for a High Priest than  The policee are for their office, when they were by themselves he   ENDENTRY should have told him of it quietly is it not so Isaac (Isaac yes) I am  not going to decide the case that is for the High Council to do Br Cutler arose made a speach and gave his decision.

President Young made some remarks concerning appointing the first Presidency. the spirit of the Lord has been with us and we know what is right it would have been our right to have appointed the Presidency, the first conference we held after Joseph death but it was not wisdom  to do it we have now whiped all of our enemies with one hand  tied behind us and now it is time to organize the Church In speaking upon principle said that an honest man would not be dishonest neither would they follow such men as Strang, the sheep would follow such as God sent even the Shepherds while dishonest men would follow the wolves. The Lord will  rule in his Kingdom. I know how things have been and are and will be. Some suppose that by appointing a presidency it is robing some of the rising generation or taking away someones rights but it is not so. Concerning persecution I will say  that the Lord will cause the wrath of man ^to^ praise him the rema- inder will the Lord restrain.

And when  the Saints do wrong the devil will reproach the Almighty  for the conduct of his Saints. dont steal it is truly mean wait untill God gives us the Earth. A little leaven leavens the whole lump, lie a little, steal a little, swear a little and  man may think all is well. And these things may taste sweet in the mouth but it will be bitter in the belly and will sting like an adder I am opposed to any evil men that feel disposed to do evil will always find an excuse for it but when a man is tempted to do wrong let him enquire is there any harm in doing this is there any harm in letting it alone then do right in all things then there will be no evil to tell upon us many good remarks were made.

He said it was the oxigen that entered the system that sustained life that we recieved so much into our bodies each day and that we discha- rged so much each day we flung of so much oxigen at each resperation He said the oxigen would meet with the Hydragen and carbon and create a heat or cholorie and this was the cause of the heat in man the same as it was with a burning lamp and if oxigen should scease to be created in man he would scease to breath or live, He explained the difference in Quantity of the oxigen created from vegitables or animal food that animal food produced far more oxigen than vegitable, and that the body discharged oxigen much faster in cold cou- ntries than in hot, and in cold weather than in warm and advised that people subsist more upon animal food in cold weather than in hot. He had tried it by going without animal food  for years and became convinced that it was injurious to him He injoyed much better health since he made use of animal food in cold weather fat meat produces oxigen in far greater quantities than lean and believes this is one reason of the prevelant fevers in Hot Countrys and seasons that oxigen is created so much faster than it discharges that it breaks the law of nature and the man has to suffer in consequence of it oxigen is also reci- eved and discharged through the pores of the skin and hence their was great propriety in keeping the body clean and washing often He urged the necessity and importance of having all dwelling houses school and meeting houses and all sleeping rooms well ventilated our sleeping ho rooms should be the largest rooms in  the house instead of small bedrooms and them closed without any fresh air, go into a crouded room that is not well ventilated and the air you breath is poison to the Human System. Mothers should be careful to se to their children that they do not lie with their heads coverd up that they  need not breath the air under cover. the faster a person respires or any creature the oftener he discharges oxigen and the oftener he needs food and the shorter would be his life without it A bird can ownly live 3 days without food a man 9 or 12 a child not as long while some anaimals or reptiles will live three months without it A child needs food much  oftener than a man it respires oftener discharges oxigen ofte- ner which needs replenishing oftener if a person lives without food the elements pray upon the body itself to creates oxigen the flesh waste away and the persons dies, it is the fat of the bear, the ground hog, and all animals that burrow up for months  without eating that feeds the oxigen and keeps life in the ani- mal yet when he comes out he is poor. He also recommended  that we put on warm clothing when we begin to feel the chill of Autum and not wait unill we feel the blast of winter   ENDENTRY we should eat in the morning before we expose ourselves  to riding in the cold, and if we wished to save hay and  provinder give our cattle and stock warm stables in winter for it would take much more to sustain the system in  the open air he opposed the principle of air tight stoves they were not healthy and many other remarks were made by the speaker   I have discoverd in my travels of late in the eastern states a great exhertion among the people to improve their system of education to make it interesting to the youth and changing the mode of teaching the black board is int roduced into the schools generally and it is found not profitable to confine the scholar in one place not more than an hour and are are giving attention to children of weak lungs and stomach using gymnastics andc filling the lungs with air and exploding it suddenly with sounds like O, Bo, Ba andc loud to exercise the lungs making them stand strait. I find many good things of this kind among  the people.   But when we look for the things of the Kingdom of God it appears to me this nation was never more barren than at the present time their hearts seem to be bared up they are bound in bands which are made strong and no man can loose them they seem to be ripe for the judgments of God and well they may be inasmuch as they have rejected the gospel shed the blood of Prophets Apostles and Patriarchs and driven the church and Kingdom of God into the wilderness and have finally been cut off from the Church and kingdom of  God by a general vote and acclemation of the the Saints of God with uplifted hands to heaven in the Temple of the Lord at Nauvoo and who can expect to get access to the hearts of this Nation now No one their condemnat ion is made shure and their damnation slumbereth not    ENDENTRY September 20, 1848 ~ Wednesday   FIGURE 20th We rode to Rhoda Foss with FIGURE us, spent the night at Fathers Carters I recieved three letters, from James H.
