March 16, 1848    the night with me. I walked out in the evening with President Whitehead council was given to them concerning emigration   ENDENTRY March 17, 1848    Council of much importance in the evening. The Captain of  the Policee with two others who were members of the Seventies  were brought before the Presidency of the Seventies for assault  &amp; batterry &amp; swearing. There was present but three of the  Presidents of the Seventies, but the High Council was present also  President Young &amp; W Woodruff it was agreed by the parties to try the case before the High Council, which was filled up and the charges  read, the defendants did not exactly plead guilty so the testimony  was heard on both sides &amp; it was proven there was a fight between them &amp; swearing. The Plaintiff opened the subject called witne- sses who testifyed. The defendants spoke &amp; bore their testimony the  Plaintiff then made his plea &amp; also his councillor the defendants  then made their plea also their Councellor.    Young arose and addressed the council in an interesting manner  the following is an extract of the Clerks munites of the President  speech. If all parties are willing I will now make some remarks  there are a good many item pertaining to this case. 1 brought before the President of the 70, but they did not pro fess to have any Jurisdiction in the case ownly in the trial of  their membership but not as a peace officer. But the High  council can sit as a municipal court &amp; try them for Church  fellowship and for a breach of duty as a Policee officer is it supp- osed that a public officer cannot do  think so &amp; when they do wrong they should be reproved as  well as any other person, I shall speak my mind without  any regard to parties favor or affection this I always calculate  to do whether I gain friends or foes I have plenty of enemies  But I dont ask any favors of them I will not be turned for  a moment out of the course of right &amp; justice if it cuts my throat. I shall tell the truths some who have pled this cause dare not tell all the truth, if Mr Hill did tantilize the Policee they had no business to fall upon him &amp; beat him. I have known Br Hill for fifteen years He is given to rough uncouth conversation  and tantalizing mens feelings, and he wont apostitize neither  Let me reason the case I am a teacher I often officiat in that  capacity. For instance Hosea Stout says that for 8 years he has  had a catalogue of names in his own mind of those who would  apostitize and as yet he had not been mistakened If a man under- stands the things of God, he knows well that every Saint of  God i of temptation, &amp; of evry snare that can be invented on the earth  to make him apostitize, loose his glory &amp; crown, this I understand  If I see a man doing wrong or is any way faltering If I take a course  to make him believe that he will fall does not that at once weaken  his faith &amp; disarm him of power to stand? it does, dont I see things  as well as the Policee I do and if I saw a man that I knew  would fall I would not tell him so but would try to save him as well as I could that when he did go my garments would be  clear before God &amp; he could not rise in Judgment against me I am here to save both Br Hosea &amp; Hill but not to destroy them  we are here to the Policee as policee and to inquire into their  conduct as Elders. Has not Isaac Hill been afflicted and maimed  who sent Hosea Stout to take Isaac Hill as a Prisioner Nobody   ENDENTRY  to go into a store in the mids of a contention &amp; undertake to tantili- ze a mans feelings while he was in anger under pretence of reproving  him for swearing A far better way would have been for him to have  waited untill he was calm &amp; composed &amp; took him one side &amp; in a  friendly manner said Br Hosea I think your course in the store was  not calculated to dignify your office as Captain of the policee and as  a member of the Seventies he would then have recieved it vary  different from what he did. I know it is natural for Br Hill to tan- talize, but that is no excuse for Br Hosea Stout to fight him, he should  have said I am a peace maker and magnifyed his office with dignity  &amp; honor but instead of that he desended to the spirit of a tantilizer  &amp; fell to fighting &amp; swearing. Policeemen should be men of more noble  minds than to desend to such things, or suffer their spirits to mingle  with such low degrading things, Hosea Stout did desend to anger &amp;  swearing which was disgraceful to a Policee man and men that  will practice such things are not fit for policeeman I know the  policeemen here are not Just right for they will get together for  hours together make fun, toll tales, drick whiskey &amp; get drunk and  that is why they are so angry all the while, and they dont pray when they come together if they did when they saw fighting &amp;  contention they would do as John Lytle did when he parted Stout  &amp; Hill says he (as he steped between them &amp; shoved one one way &amp; the  other the other way) get out of the way stop your fighting I am a peace maker &amp; wont have it. I never struck a man in my life though  I have parted many who were fighting I never saw the day but that I thought to myself to good to strike a man. Now to the Policee I say stop your baldadash pray with each other now if I have not told  the truth tell me of it. I mean to reprove the Policee if we dont  get better men in the valley I will vote against them, they have  confessed they are angry I want to see the Police officiate in their office  without getting angry if they do not they disgrace their office. I  know how Brother Hosea Stout feels concerning the spirits that murdered the Prophets &amp; still hang around us, but dont you know that devils  are going to the mountains as well as Saints, we have some of the mea- nest spirits among us on earth the net has halled in good and bad  and I am watching them continually, and we have some of the  best men with us that swear that are guilty of crime yet they wou- ld lay down their lives for us &amp; for this cause, there are others who will not gather with the Saints because they think the church is not pure  enough for them &amp; they think themselves vary pure &amp; will wait untill  the Saints get pure Holy &amp; righteous &amp; during all this time they will  live with the world in the midst of wickedness of every kind &amp; think  it all well. We have good men &amp; bad men among us, but if I see a bad  man or good man that needs reproof I will give it to him but will  I go into a store &amp; strike a man? no would it make him any better? No  but we should be saviors benovelent &amp; kind &amp; imitate the example  of the Savior. men ignorantly fan the flame of mobocracy I have  feelings about it, and often say cut his infernal throat still I do not me- an any such thing I am not good enough to do such a thing. The God of  Israel was a God of war when Israel went over the read sea &amp; the  enemies followed the Lord commanded the waters to overflow them  and it obeyed when I get good enough then I can fight to If I have  power to command the elements. Isaac Hill ought to have known better  than to have done as he did he is no more fit for a High Priest than  The policee are for their office, when they were by themselves he   ENDENTRY  not going to decide the case that is for the High Council to do Br Cutler arose made a speach &amp; gave his decision.

President Young made some remarks concerning appointing the first Presidency. the spirit of the Lord has been with us &amp; we know what is right it would have been our right to have appointed the Presidency, the first conference we held after Joseph death but it was not wisdom  to do it we have now whiped all of our enemies with one hand  tied behind us &amp; now it is time to organize the Church In speaking upon principle said that an honest man would not be dishonest neither would they follow such men as Strang, the sheep would follow such as God sent even the Shepherds while dishonest men would follow the wolves. The Lord will  rule in his Kingdom. I know how things have been &amp; are and will be. Some suppose that by appointing a presidency it is robing some of the rising generation or taking away someones rights but it is not so. Concerning persecution I will say  that the Lord will cause the wrath of man ^to^ praise him the rema- inder will the Lord restrain.

And when  the Saints do wrong the devil will reproach the Almighty  for the conduct of his Saints. dont steal it is truly mean wait untill God gives us the Earth.

And these things may taste sweet in the mouth but it will be bitter in the belly and will sting like an adder I am opposed to any evil men that feel disposed to do evil will always find an excuse for it but when a man is tempted to do wrong let him enquire is there any harm in doing this is there any harm in letting it alone then do right in all things then there will be no evil to tell upon us many good remarks were made.

He said it was the oxigen that entered the system that sustained life that we recieved so much into our bodies each day and that we discha- rged so much each day we flung of so much oxigen at each resperation He said the oxigen would meet with the Hydragen &amp; carbon &amp; create a heat or cholorie &amp; this was the cause of the heat in man the same as it was with a burning lamp and if oxigen should scease to be created in man he would scease to breath or live, He explained the difference in Quantity of the oxigen created from vegitables or animal food that animal food produced far more oxigen than vegitable, and that the body discharged oxigen much faster in cold cou- ntries than in hot, &amp; in cold weather than in warm and advised that people subsist more upon animal food in cold weather than in hot. He had tried it by going without animal food  for years and became convinced that it was injurious to him He injoyed much better health since he made use of animal food in cold weather fat meat produces oxigen in far greater quantities than lean and believes this is one reason of the prevelant fevers in Hot Countrys &amp; seasons that oxigen is created so much faster than it discharges that it breaks the law of nature and the man has to suffer in consequence of it oxigen is also reci- eved &amp; discharged through the pores of the skin and hence their was great propriety in keeping the body clean &amp; washing often He urged the necessity &amp; importance of having all dwelling houses school &amp; meeting houses &amp; all sleeping rooms well ventilated our sleeping  the house instead of small bedrooms &amp; them closed without any fresh air, go into a crouded room that is not well ventilated and the air you breath is poison to the Human System.
