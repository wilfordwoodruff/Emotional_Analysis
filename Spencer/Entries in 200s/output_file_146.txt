 because: better able to stand the climate, the poor food, longwalks, sometimes poor beds, and sometimes no beds. ElderReid of Ogden informs me he is 67 years of age andhe finds it impossible for him to put up with the hardshipincident to missionary life. his spirit is willing but hisflesh is weak. Elders Geo Goddard and Edward Stevensonare making an ernest effort in Leicester their old homethey have hopes of accomplishing some good altho their firstmeetings they regarded as almost failures so far as attendancewas concerned. We are continuing our outdoor preaching whenthe wheather permits, it having been quite rainy for two weekspast. has interifered with us some. The prospect of crops at presentis moderately good. Farmers are harvesting. In the some of theManufacturing districts business is very dull quite a numberof our people are out of employment in various places. I trustthat arrangements may be made with the Church property that [Him]and his thieving gang wont get their hands upon it even if Congressshould at some future time pass to vote a bill as the one whichfails to go through.

 -[Updated letter, but written sometime in December 1888, perhaps Dec. 5.]-President W. Woodruff and the Apostles:I desire to inform you of our condition in this ward; last week dureing the heavy Rains we had the largest freshet we have had (sinece 1878) which took out about half of our Dam., and as there are only 15 families liveing here they feel some what Discouraged, and feel it a heavy labor to put the Dam in without any asistance, and should any more leave it would be still harder for us to maintain our location here. The present Dam was put in with Piles about 4 years ago and has stood the freshets very well, we repaired it last summer and it appeared quite safe, our People began to think we had the Dam Perminant and have some pretty good substantial homes and farms, our lands seems to yeald very well when it is properly tilled, I am confident if we had as many more settlers we could establish a very good place here, and sustain our selves very well, as we have had plenty water the driest seasons and there is plenty land to take up by Home-stead or Premption, the most of the land we farm is held by Homesteads, the Health of the People is excelent and a good spirit Prevails, ever Praying for the Prosperity of Zion I am your Brother,John Bushman, Bp. 
 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona, Nov. 24, 1879.Dear Brother Tenney;I received your communication on Saturday night at the Springs 40 miles west of here. I arose early in the morning and came to Sunset at night and have counseling with Pres. Lot Smith concerning your purchase with Mr. Barth and our united voice is for you to accept his proposals But we would like to know what that 2 1/2 acres is reserved for and by whom. Cannot that be included in the pur-chase? And again does the purchase include all the water right of the creek or does the west side hold claims to a part of the waters of the creek? Brother Smith and myself both would rather you would buy out all the water right of the town if you can. If the people hold the right on the west side of the creek will they not claim the surplus water and play the Stinson game on us and still occupy the west side and let their cattle run over our crops. We would like to understand, as far as we can, cooncerning all these matters. We would rather buy out the place if we could so as to make a Mormon town of it, and not be mixed with Jews, Mexicans and Gentiles.I am satisfied that Barth is a sharper and will get all he can and you will have to be careful and in making the purchase with him do not let him have a loop hole to crawl out, and if you can get the 2 1/2 acres you had better get it. I know he is a slippery man but if anybody can trade with him I know you can. I wish You would send me a letter by the bearer and answer the foregoing questions. If your purchases will take all the water of the creek, if not what portion? Will there be any water claim on the west, if so how much? Does Barth own the 2 1/2 acres and what does he want to keep it for? Will he ^not^ have a hold on a part of the water to make us trouble? We would like information upon all these points. Will there be surplus water for him or anybody else to claim to make us trouble?We would like you to buy all the water rights of the place if possible. We think we can back you up so as to make the purchase. Is sSt. Johns surveyed by the U. S. surveyors? You say the 2 1/2 acres is on the edge of town on the east side of the creek. I thought the village was on the west side of the river. Does your purchase include the dwellings or any of them? We would like an explanation of all these things. Brother Smith is anxious to have you buy out of the whole town if you could, if not get all the water rights you can.Of course you will not have a chance to consult with us about anything after you get this until you get your purchase made, but do the best you can and whatever bargain you make bind it with a band of iron so strong that noone can break it. Write by the bearer all you can about it and as soon as you get the bargain send me word by mail.I shall write to Brother Taylor immediately and tell him to have mis-sionaries who are coming to take possession of the place to bring cows with them of the age you speak of. Do not fail to make the purchase if possible. I Tthink that is all I need to say upon the subject. With regard to occupying the Colorado Meadows, there should be means taken immediately to occupy the place by the brethren. We are now making arrangements to fit up teams and send 2 from Sunset, 2 from Bringham City and will call for 1 from St. Joseph and 4 perhaps from Snowflake and will send what we can to you to take up the Meadow forth with, but we shall want you to go with them to go with them to Greers and help them settle or locate and Gilbert Greer might make a claim and I want these brethren to locate their claims so as to exclude the St. Johns folks from getting a hold there. 
 We will start them off forthwith and send them to you. I want all these things kept as secret as possible until we get the place secured. We have concluded to start 4 men tomorrow morning to St. Joseph and from there to Brother Greers and Brother Brookbank will take the letter to you from St. Joseph. You will find him a No. 1 man and I want him to be with you in the mission, I know you can work together like a charm and I now want to say to you once for all this is the voice of all our Council and if you want any more,I wilol say it is the Will of the Lord that Ammon M. Tenney preside over this mission. Therefore make no more excuse but round up your shoulders and receive this mission and appointment and God will bless you and make you an instrument in his hands of bringing many of the House of Israel into the Church and Kingdom of God, who will be saved through your instrumentality. Therefore, go to, unitewith your brethren and lead out in this work and open your mouth, preach the Gos-pel to the Lamanites or Nephites as you find them and prophecy unto them as you shall be led by the power of God and the Lord will stand by you and you will be able to accompllish all that your heart desires in righteousness.As Brother Brookbank will not return, but will stop with you, therefore send your communications to me by mail, unless there is a private conveyance open. I want the Meadows taken possession of about the same time you buy St. Johns or a little before so that they cannot get possession. Now if you make any change in your purchase of St. Johns notify me immediately as I may want to write to President Taylor.Concerning your going to St. Johns with your family; if you purchase perhaps you had better go there and take possession of it. But I want you to go with the Brethren to Brother Greer's and scatter them through the Meadow and take up all the desirable places as fast as the brethren come. I do not intend to let daylight, dark night or grass grow under my feet to stop me trying to do my duty or helping to settle Arizona or  New Mexico or bringing the House of Israel into the Kingdom of God not if I know it.I would like you to instruct the missionaries in Spanish eor council them to improve their time in it what you can. I have thought of asking you what you would think trying to buy out that Mexican at the Spring where we got a drink of water as we came into Meadow. It might do no harm to try. I do not think of anything more at this time.My love and blessings to your wives, children, mother, brother and friends.Yours Brother in the GospelLewis Allen. (Wilford Woodruff)PRIVATE: I am going to write to Brother Greer to assist the brethren to locate the Meadow. Now I do not know how much of the Spirit of Zion he has got. His son Gilbert has the Spirit of his mission. I think if he has and can locate a claim with the rest it might be well for them to do it. I would like you to see how Brother Greer is and if he feels like it I would like him to help what he can in it.I have given Brother Gilbert Greer a notification of his appointment as a missionary to the Lamanites under your direction. I would like him to take hold immediately with you and perhaps he can assist you in your temporal affairs. Some of these missionaries who will go to the Meadows who to make claims as far as they can I want them to enter upon their missions as soon as convenient. 
 I do not wish to make any presidency in this mission separate from the presiding officers of these Stakes, so while I am in the country I will give you ^what^ council I can, but you may consider yourself under the Presidency of Jesse N. and Lot Smith, but while any of the twelve are in the country it is their province to give counsel upon all these matters as far as they have an oppor-tunity.I am soon expecting Brigham Young and several others from the north, before long and we may call and visit you.L.

Galbraith from Sligo Ireland, who is a Priest in the Liverpool Branch and who is desirous to make himself useful in assisting in the building up of the kingdom of God on the earth in any manner that his time or talents can be made available. As he is comparatively a stranger I have taken the liberty to introduce him unto you in the hope there may be a vacancy in some of the Latter-day Saint schools where his talent might be available as he has been very successful amongst children and takes much pleasure in that profession and believes that Theology should be one of the principle subjects in education as the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.Trusting you will pardon the liberty I have taken and kindly consider the interest I have in the young & rising generation, I remainYour brother in the gospelGeorge Teasdale

Weibye of Manti.with Elder Mads Jorgensen, of Provo, and AndrewKnudsen, of Provo, as his 1st and 2nd Counsellors Elder J. P.Toolsen, of Smithfield, as clerk & recorder.

Thompson of Brig-ham City, Hans Larson, of Kamas, Ole Olesen of Lewis-ton, O. J. Johnson, of Plain City, and Oluf Jensen ofBrigham City. H. P. Jensen, of Provo. The companywithout counting the returning missionaries num-ber 176 souls 93 adults and 83 children (Thereis one amongst them who was baptized wheneight years old he says who has been sent forby his twin brother who is likely to be sent backhis appearance is so much against him raggedand rough. It is much to be regretted this kindof people are sent for, surely we have enoughof the vagobond element amongst us. The saintshave objected to his company so we have had 
 to berth him with the gentiles. We cannot beresponsible for this class. His name is AdolphPeter Hansen aged 21, Booked for Salt Lake City.All this I learn by representation which shouldbe reliable. It has pleased our heavenly Fatherto draw into His fold a young man who isthe son of a clergyman of the established Churchof England. He has been an earnest workerin education and in faith relying upon Godto provide the necessary means, for the indegent. His name is Thomas Richard Galbraith.He has been in the office a good deal and Ihave taken to him as an honest man. He isgoing to work his passage to New York hav-ing obtained a situation on the S. S. WyomingHe is a sailor having been apprenticed to thesea and travelled a good deal. He enteredas a sailor but the captain has placed himamongst the stewards. He was going to workuntil he obtained sufficient means to goto Utah but I have advanced him the moneyfeeling that his labors will be more valuable to us amongst the rising generation.He appears to be a gentleman, humble,prayerful and willing. Has quite a goodfaith and trust in God and improvesupon acquaintance although he has quitethe ministerial expression that he has beentrained in which will ^doubtless^ give way before the 
 natural education he will obtain throughassociation in the Kingdom of God. I shouldhave used him here in the work of the ministry, and he was quite willing, but I havereflected that it would be better for himto get a home in Zion and better educatedin true principle, with some experience inthe gospel to better qualify him for thatlabor. I have given him a letter of intro-duction to yourself so you may see himand if you think proper for him toengage in school keeping in the Latter-day Saints schools that he can do so. I have also given him a letter of introduc-tion to Bro. James Jack who could intro-duce him to yourself when convenient.This has been entirely my own arrangement Bro. Galbraith never asked sucha thing. He said if he could reach Utahhe was satisfied he could make his living and was going trusting inthe Lord, and this is what the Lord hasdone for him, for my natural suspiciousnature would have prompted me to takeno such course. I tell him he need notthank me for this but Him who hasso wrought upon me to take this step. 
 The future will unfold whether I have beenled right or not. So far as I am concernedI am willing to risk it for my impressionsare he will prove true blue. I regret toinform you that Bro Payne from Filmorenow laboring in London will have to re-turn through delicate health. With regardto Bro. Jas. Leaing he is the best missionarywe have in the field. He is doing anexcellent work in London presiding overthat Conference and if it would beagreeable to all we should be pleasedto keep him until next spring but if itis necessary he should return, why hewill leave in October. Bro. Payne is aworker, he is a first class missionary, andhas done a good work. Bro. Wm Kelson will have to return through ill healthHe is hardly capable for the hardships of missionary life in the British Isles.I am happy to say we are all reasonablywell at 42 and join in kind love toyourself Counsellors and brethren withyou. Hoping and praying for the re-demption of Zion I remain as ever:Yours very affectionately in the GospelGeorge Teasdale

U. Stucki of the Swiss and German Mission has been down with the small pox which he contracted in Bohemia at the house of Bro. Dittrich. He was travelling through the mission and taken sick while in Stuttgart with a heavy fever and chills, pains in his back and head which kept increasing on him until he broke out. He thought he had caught a severe cold and kept moving about filling his appointments being all the time exposed to heat causing sweatings and then to chilly winds, and made the trip from Basel to Bern in a draughty railway car. He mentioned these facts to show how miraculously he was healed by the power of God being so exposed to heat & cold. When he reached Bern Bro Brandley felt determined to wait on Pres Stucki and nurse him, as he had no fear. The Brethren administered to him and in less than two weeks he was up again comparativelywell, only weak. No one took the disease and no one in the house outside of our own folks knew that anyone had the disease. Bro. Stucki has hardly any marks from the effects of the disease. He has surely been very much blessed of our heavenly Father. 
 Bro Stucki reports that while he was in Reichenberg he sent for Bro. L. M. Cannon in Saxony as he thought it would be a good plan for Bro Dittritch to have some help, but through a couple of traitors in the Church a strong persecution arose. Bro. Dittritch was arrested for committing the crime of teaching an unauthor-ized religion, baptizing &c and the prospect was he would get perhaps a year and a half imprison-ment so he concluded to give them the slip and he was then in Bern. Four of his children had been sick with the small pox, one of them had died and his wife had been sick. His family is in a very pitiable condition alone amongst traitors and enemies, only a few Saints to sympathise and they too poor to render any assistance. Bro Cannon barlely escaped arrest. I think I have stated before that the Swiss and German Mission will require some more missionaries to relieve those who are going home in the fall. They will want at least seven good missionaries for the fall indeed the field is amply large for many more elders.Prest Stucki is an excellent missionary. He says "TheElders feel well everywhere and they are blessed in their labors more especially in South Germany Four ^persons^ have been baptized in Saxony who seem to be earnest and faithful. I am somewhat troubled about the Turkish Mission. I receive letters from BrosHintzie, J. M. Sjodabl, W. H. Smart and Locander With the exception of Bro. Hintzie and J. M. Sjodabl 
 IIthey do not seem to have much faith in the Turkish Mission or in Bro Hintze. They say he tells the people too much from pre-existence to Adam being the God of this earth and that God is only man perfected. The principle topic is a coloni-zation scheme, means for printing, and  house rent and "backshish" which I am informed "is absolutely necessary." Bro Hintze says "I cannot say what we may need in means because it is all so uncertain where a government is to be bought with money. Then I do not know what to apply for without knowing what our brethren will sustain. Excuse me for a suggestion. As the whole matter now stands, and as it is of great importance would it not be better that you and the Presidency at home see me face to face so as to make proper arrangementsas to our efforts here? It would save me anstime and anxiety." The above subjects of those wants of the mission and schemes for gettingthe gospel before. the people, all requiring meansare what the letters I receive are composed of.Bro. Clove is returning sick. Just aboutthe time he has some smattering of the lan-guage enough to converse he is obliged toreturn. I watched to see binic until I wrote to you but concluded to write for the prospectof acertaining how far I am at liberty to go 
 in the using of means for instead of one establishment there are three expecting to draw on this office. One in Constantinopleone in Aintab and one in Palestine. With the exception of Bro. Sjodabl the brethren do not seem, to have much faith in the Turkish Mission only to kill time. They have got the experience of Elder Clove and have seen how he has passed his time and of the labors of Elder Hintze and his experience, seen the class of converts who have professed to become converted and got acquainted with the opposition of all around them and the absence of any interest manifested that they do not write very encouraging let-ters. If you have noticed any commanica-tions from the elders in that mission it has been about the manners and customs of the people as they view it. Letters that seem to have been written for a consideration to help them to a little means in their needy condition. But so far as missionary labors are concerned they do not seem to have much to write about. I would be pleased to hear from you how far you will be willingI should supply this mission with means beecause they have drawn upon us to consume all the three hundred dollars appropriated. I wrote to Prest Hintze asking about how much he thought it would need for publishing some tracts &c and 
 IIItelling him that I did not think we wanted to buy the government for the sake of the privilege to preach the gospel, that called for the remarks I have quoted from his letter. Some time ago the brethren got some printing done in germany and all the tracts were confiscated. In No 34 Star we have publish-ed a letter from Prest Hintze. I think some policy should be defined with regard to this Mis-sion. Prest H. writes Our house rent  5.0.9 is again due and I have no M. funds only to rely upon your assistance until all affiers matters are settledI extract a portion of his letter for your considerationTurkey is a long way from home. It takes over $20000 perhaps $250 00/100 to reach here. Most elders are stripped when they arrive (I was even without the necessary means to reach Constantinopleand may as well state right here that I have no present resources to raise funds. I am therefore forced to look for assistance to me a continual regret) There for the elders to go into the interior and live takes another good round sum Hence the fact is we arrive poor, and we nearly all need assistance from home in some way, and that assistance is not forth coming. Therefore we havehad to ask your assistance. For instance my Bp.was especially instructed by Apostles F. D. Richards 
 and John H. Smith to assist me and when I wrote to him about the twenty pounds I personally bor-rowed of your office he did not even answer; He is not a bad man but I understand my case is among the common ones." Well I think I have said enough about the Turkish Mission. If it was now a question of dollars and dimes I should hesitate to bother you with so long a letter. The ani-mormons have been breathing out threatnings and this office is watched.We are all well in health and spiritsat present. Bro. Brookband has been quite unwell but is better. We keep sending BroJohn L. papers when there is anything of interest. Bro. C. D. Fjeldsted writing from Copenhagen Aug 12, says "There is quite an opposition started in the Aalborg Conferenceall the Utah brethren except two having been called before the police authoritiesand one already received his sentence of banishment. Will inform you further as soon as we learn particulars." The elders had been successful in baptizing a member and it aroused the priests so the brethren said.With kindest regards to yourself, Counsellors and all with you, I remain as everYour brother in the covetGeo Teasdale

S. Nevada. There were three appointed tothe Netherlands. Jos. H. Lambert, Albert Spencerand Louis W. Simmons. Eight were appointed to theBritish Isles and were located in the following Conferen-ces Samuel W. Western and John E. Huish, to the Bir-mingham; George Marshall and Robert H. Hodgeto the Manchester; John H. Clark and Edwin JohnLonghurst, to the London; Charles England to theNorwich Conferences and John T. Evans toWales. Bro. John B. Milner and his wife on avisit to relatives and business. They were all ingood health and spirits. We held a council meet-ing in the morning with the missionaries and theywere appointed to their fields of labor. They metwith us at our evening meeting in Bittern St,and bore their testimonies and expressed their wil-lingness to do their best to fill a good mission.(Prest Jos. Leaing, of the London Conference, who waswith us at our morning council, gave the brethrensome most excellent counsel on missionary labors. 
 Bro. Joseph Leaing has expressed himself as everyLatter-day Saint, or servant of God feels. Hewishes to be where the Lord wants him. In yourcommunication to me, of July 23rd, you say "We thinkit quite proper for you to release Br. Jos Leaing sothat he may return home if he so desires " Now hehas never expressed that desire. He is one of theLords Own, a minute man, a bright live miss-ionary and waits patiently to be released whenhe shall receive that word. He has been herethree years next month, having arrived here onOctober 13, 1886 and is willing to stay as long ashe is required. He enjoys the fellowship of theHoly Ghost, and consequently knows that thework we are engaged in is of God, and guidedby the Spirit of revelation, according to theorder of the Priesthood that He had appointedto the responsibility of presidency and thedirecting of the labors of their fellowservantsunder His direction, or revealed will, andso he says "when the Lord manifests His willfor me to return I shall be pleased to do so,but until then I am perfectly willing to la-bor wherever I may be appointed." As I un-derstand it, my beloved president, this is thetrue feeling of every disciple of Jesus Christ.It is, "Father not my will but thine be done."It is the glory of God to have such humblefaithful soul who love to serve Him and 
 keep His commandments, because they wantto. Now I would be pleased to have your mindon this question Shall Bro. Leaing stay until theSpring or go him this fall? I ask this questionto satisfy my own mind as much as any-thing else. I will write more freely next timeafter I have received your answer. I havereceived a letter from Bro. Job Pingree inwhich he says he has had an interviewwith yourself & counsel and some membersof the Twelve "in my behalf" I am at a loss toremember whatever I could have said to himto call forth such an expression. Bro Pingreespent a few days with us and we muchenjoyed his excellent spirit. We talked to-gether very freely about the mission andthe spirit of the gentiles. He had quitean experience visiting his friends andacquaintances. He was with me in the prayerroom and I read him some letters fromthe elders, all testifying to the spirit ofindifference in some places and mobocra-tic feeling in others so that he got quite aninsight into the condition of the missionand I remember telling him that if he sawany of the authorities at home he would bewell posted to give them a pretty good report 
 much better then I could do through the me-dium of a sheet of paper; and when he left allI remember saying was give my kind love tothe Presidency, or any of the Twelve you may seeand tell them we are patiently rowing againstthe stream. We have been sounding the gospeltrumpet by preaching and destributing tractsand consequently have stirred up the people,unprincipled men finding Jarman are makinga good living by traduscing the "mormons" haveadopted a similiar mode of obtaining aliving and selling Jarmans books of courseall this inflames the people against us. Youknow how ready they are to believe anythingagainst us. But we are busy doing all wecan to seek out the House of Israel andtrying by the grace of God to do our dutyand tell the people what the Book of Mormonis and supply them at a cheap rate.  Inall our heavenly Father has blessed us and en-couraged as in our labors and duties.  It isHis work and we are only poor representa-tives of His cause, but we love to serve Him andlabor in our poor way looking to Him for theincrease, and grace ourselves to over come andendure unto the end in His Church & Kingdom.So far as we are concerned we are not discouraged.If the people do not want the gospel it is their 
 loss not ours. If they prefer the testimony ofan escaped lunatic going through theland with a lying spirit traducing Godspeople, why we cannot help it. Our Eldershave been testifying to the restoration ofthe gospel and the authority of God,with the priesthood, to administer in theordinances of His House, and offering themthe Pearl of Great Price Eternal Lives andthey despise them and their testimony, soit is not to be wondered at, they shouldcrowd together to listen to and believea lie, that they may be damned whohave pleasure in unrightiousness and be-lieve not the truth. I do not know thatwe should condemn these people so muchwhen we see the course being pursued inthe gathering place of the saints amongstthose who have been converted and blessedof the Lord, and their children who havebeen raised in the midst of light andtruth. From all we hear through the pressand from private sources, if there arenot those in Zion ripening for the burn-ing as well as those on the outside world,why then we will gladly confess ourselves 
 mistaken. President Woodruff, the elders inIsrael, at home or abroad, who are servingGod and keeping His commandmentsare not discouraged. They understandthe signs of the times and know that butfew men will be left. The propecies do notpoint to the Church of the Lamb being so verynumerous; they know it is a strait and narrowway that leads to life everlasting, and aremore interested in making their owncalling and election sure then gettingdiscouraged because of the folly or in-difference of others. Do not think we arediscouraged or weary of serving God, forit is not so. We simply trust in God andseek His counsels day and night. Wewant His will to be done, we want HisKingdom, not only for ourselves, but for thebenefit of our posterity of unborn generations.We want the government of God and the ruleof His Priesthood of righteousness for we haveall faith that where the meek and pure inheart rule we will have a reign of righteous-ness.

I would inform you that Irecieved a letter from my wife yesterday informing me that shetook two letters out of the Office for me, one from you, & the other from Brother Asahel. She gave me the purport of them. I was glad to hear from you, & all the friends & esspecially that the word hadthe desired affect in Aunt Cossetts family, & with others. I would like tobe with you & our friends in Connecticut long enough to build up aChurch, but if I cannot be, I pray God to send some faithful servent amongyou to teach the word. I expect you wish to hear where I am, & what I amdoing &c. On the 19th of Aug, in company with Elder Hale, I left Portland onboard the steamboat Bangor, foxr fox Islands, Vinalhaven. After travling 100miles on the steam boat; we took a vessel & was landed on North fox Island at 2 oclok Sunday morning following, entire strangers & about peneyless. We called at the firsthouse & retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day & night. We arose at 8oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island.they informed us theirre was a Baptist meeting house & church & priest in thecentre of the Island, & that there would be preaching to day. In the name of theLord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deaconto come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message tothe people & wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us intothe pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose & addressedthe congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the firsttime the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea,to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments forpreaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long & 2 miles wide containing 800inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (thisBaptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In thefirst fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, & the whole Island flocked out to hear.The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed & began to cry against us& would not let us have the meeting house. But the excitement ^was^ so great & the people so muchin our favor that on Sunday the 27th the people asseb assembled at a school house to hear us 
 While Mr. Newton had the meeting house to himself without one solitary soul to accompany him.Even the deacons of the church were attending our meetings & enquiring into these things && calling upon us to visit them, & the sound went abroad to other Islands of thesea with rapidity, & they came over in their ships & boats to hear for themselves. OnSunday the 3rd Sept. I preached to a Large congregation assembled together from differentIslands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Sea Captain & his Lady cameforeward & wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Atlantic & Elder Halelead them down into the sea & baptized them. These are the first baptized upon the Islandsof the sea (to my knowledge) by the Elders of Israel, & they are the first fruits of our min-istry here. & On last Sunday the 10 th of the month, I met a large congregation at the sameplace from different Islesands, & & preached to them from Math 16 ch 17, 18, & when I closedanother sea captain a member of the Baptist church came forward for baptism & also a young Lady. We repaired to the sea shore, & while the people throng'd the beach I leadthem forth into the ocean & baptized them both for the remission of their sins & ladehands upon them & they received the Holy ghost & were made glad. On the Tuesdayfollowing three others wished to be baptized & the ordinance was administered unto themby Elder Hale which makes seven we have baptized. Thus you seae the Lord hath notsent us here in vain. There is many on our right & left ready as it were to step intothe waters of Baptism. Calls begin to salute us from the different Islands come &preach to us, come & preach to us. We have visited South Fox Island & held five meet-ings with them, they came out by hundreds & filled the homes. South Fox Island is 10 miles long & 5 wide containing 1000 inhabitants with 6 school houses no meeting house but a methodistchurch, & a priest in their midst. They have 3 saw mills & one grist mill these are all tidemills vinal haven fits out rising of 100 vessels for fishing & mostly from this Island.The inhabitants of Vinalhaven are wealthy, healthy, industrious, intelligent, generous & very hospitableto strangers notwithstanding they are mostly fishermen. pop 1,800. Vinalhaven includes both of fox Islands. NorthIsland is rather rocky & rough have some fine farms, rase good wheat, barley, & potatoes, which is the staple pro-ductions, but little stock excepting sheep which are numerous. they have but just finished haying and are nowin the midst of wheat harvest. There is an aboundance of raspburies and gooseburies on these Islands, but arenow mostly gone. not much of any other fruit. The timber is spruice, fir, & hemlock. Their is one Post Office &store on this Island. one tide grist mill, &c.South Fox Island is as near without any form or void I think asany think I ever saw. It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universalmass of ledges & shelves of rocks formed into hills & valleys cut up into necks & points to make room for thecoves and harbours that run through & through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it issupposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks & angles. There is some small partsof this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour & toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and spruce, the timber & bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the samemanner with fir & birch. this people procured their wealth & living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supplygreater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland & prepare them for sale here. their ismany kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel,stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, DolphinFrost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers,Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels, Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, & Porposes &c &c. & many others not named. I have stood on theshore & seen large schools of Mackerel come up to us so that we could catch any quantity of them with hooks that wewished, also the beach is supplyed with clames in almost any part of the Island. The adjoining Islands are more fertilethan these. In a clear day I can view with the naked eye about fifty Island of the sea many of which are inhabited, & sometimes20 or 30 gallant ships are passing by us at once &c. I have not givien this brief history of these Islands because my mind is more 
 on these things than my calling, for it is not. consequently I wish to call your minds back again to my labour in the vineyardI remarked that many came out to hear us on the South Island. The methodist priestbecame alarmed for fear his foundation also was in danger, & he came over whare we were baptizing& made friends with the Baptist priest, (like Herod & Pilate) and called a meeting I went outto hear him. [##Luke 23:12##] He commenced warm hostilities against the Book of Mormon and our principlesI wrote down his discours & are to give answer to it next Sunday, at which time I expectto meet a numerous assembly I learned he would not be present to hear my answer so Iarose & rectifyed some of his wild mistakes in his presensce before he left the congregation.The Baptist priest has written Letters & even gone himself to the main land after several prieststo come over and help them, declairing if they do not come the churches here will surelyfall. -[But cursed is man that puteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord]- But O yepriests of Baal your cry is in vaine. The God of Israel hath set his hand to recover Israel his peopleThe stone has begun to roll. God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, andwith them he will rend your Kingdoms. The cry of the Saints is assending unto the Ears of the Lordof Sabaoth for Ephraim. The Apostles of the Lamb of God are bearing the Keys of his Kingdomon the shores of Europe. Yea & the mighty captains of these Islands are receeving the gospel ofJESUS CHRIST & injoying its power. And the call of many from distant Islands hasalready entered into our Ears to come & preach to them. My own Book of Mormonhas this day taken its departure over the billows of the great deep to teach those that trade inships at sea, & the word & work is propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And every weaponformed against Zion shall soon be broken, & he that raises his puny arm against it, is fightingagainst God, & shall soon mourn because of his loss. I say these things are so as God [himself]& the Spirit beareth record & the record is here. Therefore O Babylon thy fall is sure.My dear parents suffer me to drop a few words of mymeditations on this paper. When I think where I am, what my calling is, & where I have been & whare I shall be, & have to do in this generation, I marvel & wonder. I [page torn]myself. A few years since, I was tendindg mill as other men not expecting to do [page torn]to live & di[e] with my friends. But how changed the scene, the last four years has [page torn]the plow, called me into the ministry, bestowed the Holy priesthood, annointing, [page torn]Blessing upon my head, & called me into the ranks of [page torn] [s]eventy Apostles to pus [page torn]from the ends of the earth, and act a conspicuous part in winding up the august scene of these lastdays in rending the kingdoms of darkness, and error with everlasting truth. It has called me tovisit 16 different states in America, & travel about 14,000 miles to preach the word of God, andare now standing upon the Islands of the Sea, & thousands seeking wisdom & instructionat my mouth, While at the same time its wise & learned complain Bitterly that I amsapping the foundations of their Holy religion, churches & kingdom, & the ships of the seaspread their canvas to bring captains & sailors to hear my voice. I say amid thesetruths I ask myself the question who am I. ^I^ am that poor, weak, ignorant, IlliterateWillford. then I have nothing to boast. No God forbid. It is not Willford that has done this,but it is the power & work of God. I'll acknowledge he hath chosen the weak thingsof this world to perform his work with, & if I glory it shall be in the cross of ChristI cannot tell when I shall see any of you again. their was some invisidble power seemed tohurry me from connecticut to come on my journey, it has been so with me ever since I left Kirtland, untill I reached theseIslands, and the reason was because of the great work to be done here, for the sound will go from here to a vast number of theIslands to prepare the way before us. But I rejoice that I had the privilege of visiting you at all. I now feel as though it will be my privilegeto visit you again & build up a church in connecticut. But if I do not I pray GOD to send some one among you that will. I have greatfaith yet to believe that many of my blood relations & other friends will stand in the covenant before they die. yes I believe my Parents & their family will, for I know they are of the Blood of Ephraim, and the Lord will never suffer the good my father hath done to the poor in his ^day^ go unrewarded. I believe you will both live to see a change in this world which is fast hastning. it would be great joy to mysoul to see you stand in the covenant. It is the work of God that hath called me to do as I have done, and it marvelous in mine eyes. I rather expectto spend next summer amid these Islands of the sea. I intend to visit Deer Island as soon as possible, it is but 12 miles to it. it contains 4000inhabitants, and theirre is but one priest among them. I do not know whare I shall spend the winter, whether here or in Scarborough. My friendsmay still direct letters to Scarborough. Give my respects to Eunice, To Uncle Ozem & family & Aunt Cossetts family I think of writing to them both & also^to^ Brother Asahel, & finally remember me to all inquiring fr^i^ends. O how I wish they would all receive the fullness of the gospel. DearParents Pray for me & watch the signs of the times. I want to see you all much but I'll be content whare God would have me. ElderHale, & Phebe both wish to be remembered to you and all inquiring friends. That the peace of GOD may abide with you & thatyour lives health & strength may be prescious in HIS sight, is the prayer of your Dutiful son Willford Woodruff

 Rochester Sangamon County Illinois Dec 19th 1838[FIGURE] Eunice WoodruffMy Dear SisterAlthough I am in the midst of acroud & but a few moments allotted me to write yet I feel it my Duty to appropriatethese few moments in communicating a few words to you & my Dear parents.I thought it proper to direct this sheet to you in consequence of the writingon the 3rd page which is the production of Brother Asahels pen which I foundamong his papers which appears to be an address to you. Whether it is a copy ofwritings already in your possession or not I am unable to say. But as I feel anxiousto put in your possession all writings that you have sent him or that he hasdirected to you is the cause of my writing upon the same sheet. As Death hasclosed all communications between Asahel & yourself & our parents I feelit my duty to give you all information that I possess concerning his sickness& Death or any thing concerning him that will be of interest to you. I alsofeel it my Duty to write to you as often as my circumstances will admit& I have matter of interest to comunicate. I have much uponmy mind at this time I would like to communicate which I mus[t]omit for want of time but I will touch upon some importent itemsFirstly I hold in my hands a letter Dated Farmington Oct 31st 1838 fromAphek & Azubah & Eunice Woodruff to Mr James Dayson. in fine I havein my possession (I suppose) all the writings that were Directed to Asahel as well ashis own compositions I took them because I supposed that I should be ableto put them into the possession of my parents & Sister sooner than they could obtain them any other way & I much doubt whether you would ever obtained them had I left them in Terre Haute I shall give youinformation upon this subject from time to time as I write. I have not hadtime as yet to look over his writings but little & do not know what there isamong them, but all of his corresponding letters with his Dear Sister & parents & Azmon & myself & many other friends are among them there is many compo-sitions of his own of interest among them I was particular to enquire of hisclerk & also Mr Smith concering his mind, his sickness, & death & I learnthe following particulars that he was considered one of the first & most respect-able citizens of Terre Haute & his death much regretted[upside-down text]Wilford Woodruff toEunice Woodruffgiving the Acco[un]t of the deathof Ashael Woodruff[end of upside-down text] 
 his clerk said to never find a more [page torn] task than to part with him he saidhe never saw a [page torn] mind than his he also remarked that he was very absent mindedfor several months before his Death cheerful most of the time but occasionly lostin Deep meditation he spent muc^c^h of the time During his last months among his friendsin public at ^times^ almost to the neglect of his business this was a secret they could not account for (ButI could have told them that it was his mind upon spiritual subjects he was convinced of light & truth had none tounbosom his feelings unto & mingled with company to pass away his time & c.) [None] knew his mind uponreligious subjects he was moral in all his conduct far from any thing leading to disruptionhe often spoke of his friend, & [doted] much upon a visit from me he remarked when he wastaking sick that he feared he should not recover. he did not convers upon religious subjectsafter he was takingen sick & I do not wonder at it for there was no spirit in Terre Hauteto receieve it I wonder how Asahels mind would have suffered him to have remainedthere as long as it Did. the Land was as [page torn] the garden of Eden but a wicked barrenplace spiritually. I wrote Asahel a Letter which he received just before his Death inwhich my mind was much exercised I never felt like bearing stronger testimony to anyperson than in that letter I little thought that it was my last testimony to him Iwrite a letter to him afterwards but it did not arive untill after his death There wasthree Doctors attended upon Asahel During his sickness (which was 3 to many) I visited myBrothers grave I felt solumn while viewing it poor man he had not a relative to attendon his bed side or follow him to his grave I picked up some small stones from hisgrave in memory of him I was sorrow that in the sale of his papers that some articlesof his clothing was not reserved but every thing of that nature was sold I have all of his[former] account Books his journals compositions, his watch two silver thimbles& pencils & penknife & c. you can make any enquiries of me by letter concerningthose things that you wish as soon as I can inform you where to direct a letter Iam sensible that Asahels Death will be deeply felt by you all he was a belovedSon & Brother truly may the Lord comfort you all under this affliction. My DearSister since Asahel is gone It has given me great consolation to meditate uponthe cause. you have persued continue faithful in the cause in which you areengaged & you will receive a crown of Life! O that I can but meet my Sisterin the celestial glory the thought of it will sweeten my tri[a]ls on Earth. Do notthink that your Brother is Discouraged because of persecutions in the west. No God forbidit is true a number of our worthy brethren have sealed their testimony with their Bloodof late, it is equally true that if it is the will of God your Brother is ready & willing to share thesame fate. I tremble not at the approach of Death it has no terror to me I may be called tofeel a Missourian's steel or lead for my religion if so & my work is Done I say amen, I amready to meet it you may hear of my Death, but by the grace of God assisting me youshall not be pained with the intelligence that I have drawn back unto perdition I amtravling through the cold of winter with a wife & child which is severe at this time but Iendure these things patiently many of our Brethren are stoped at the Mississippi River beca[u]seof there faith I may be stoped myself but I shall travel untill I am give me yourprayers Dear parents & Sister while Asahel sleeps in Death let me be consecrated tolive or Die for Christ.

 Salt Lake City,April 21, 1880.Ammon M. TenneyDear Brother:I have tried to get time to write to you ever since I have reached SaltLake City, but have never been in a situation to give you any information forthe want of time and getting certain business done before the Council. Bro.Taylor got a letter from J. W. Y. -[John W. Young]- saying that you had moremissionaries than was necessary at the Meadows to hold the claims so you wasgoing to put some of them into the Missionary field. I was glad to learn this.If you have men to spare, the sooner the better. Bro. Young telegraphed thatyou, Christofferson and himself were at Albuquerque to buy goods for a Co-opStore, and he spoke about taking contracts on the Railroad for our people. Ifthe brethren could unite together and take a contract so as to pay, I think itwould be a good thing, so as to get their bread.Now, concerning St. Johns. How is that a going? Bro. Hatch wrote me thatsomebody was sent as an Agent to borrow 100 cows to make the first payment ofBro. Flake. I was in hopes that the people who went there would be able to raisethat first hundred cows. I wish you would write to me an[d] let me know how mattersare at St. Johns, and what arrangements you have made for entering the land. Ihave got the privilege from Bro. Taylor and Council to use all tithing stockin the Territory to help pay for St. Johns, unless the brethren can occupy theland and pay for it.This may be used as a loan and repaid when the people pay; I shall writeto Lot and Jesse N. Smith and Richards of St. Joseph to unite with the tithingstock what they can, for we do not want that purchase to fail and I want you to call upon Christofferson of Round Valley, Bp. Hunt and Jesse N. Smith of Snow-flake, Bp. Richards of St. Joseph and Lot Smith of Sunset, and Bp. Lake ofBrigham City to gather the tithing stock, and you use it for the payment onthat purchase as a loan, keeping a strict account of what tithing stock youuse for the purpose. I shall write to them about it.I wish you would write to me as soon as you get this, and tell me how things are with you, and what you have paid on St. Johns, and what the prospectis. Tell me where the railroad is going and what the prospect is for our brethren to take jobs on it, and what rate. Direct from W. Woodruff, Salt LakeCity, Utah Box 321. I feel anxious to hear from you, and want to know whatmissionaries you have in the field and where, and any news I will be glad to get.My kind regards to Sister Tenney and all the brethren with you.Your brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake CityMay 25, 1880Mr. A. M. Tenney,Dear Brother;I received your two letters May 7 and 8, and ^they^ have been read to Bro.Taylor, and we are all pleased that things are as well as they are with you.A few items I wish to speak of. We sent word to the Priests and Bishops to assistin paying for the purchase of St. John in case of necessity, but as they can haveno demand upon you until next November perhaps by that time there may be helpenough to pay for the place without borrowing the Church stock, at least it mightbe well to let it rest until fall to see what position you will be in.Concerning taking contracts on the railroad I think that would be well, butI think the Presidents of the Stakes should be consulted and a Committee appointedand some man chosen to make these contracts for the people who will do justice bythe people and not pocket one half the people's earnings by their lax^b^or. Ofcourse any man who takes these contracts on the railroad should be well paid forhis labors. But there is so much speculation in taking railroad contracts thatit wants to be well guarded. This work should be done through the Board of Tradeor a Committee appointed by the people. But one thing should be guarded against,the Mormons should not underbid each other but get as much as they can for thework. Our people should grade all the railroad that goes through our settlementsand if they act wisely they can get a good price for it. I think it would be wellto consult with Jesse N. Smith and Lot Smith on the subject, as the work willhave to be done by those stakes.You will want to unite together upon that work, and all act honestly witheach other, and let each have what he earns. I think the grading of that rail-road will give profitable business to many of our people.Again Bro. Watkins gave me an account of some political or Elections matterswith you concerning sending the next Delegate to Congress. I want to say concern-ing this matter. It is one of the most delicate things between this church andthe Gentiles. There should be no step taken by any of the Saints upon this subject 
 or pledges offered by any of the people without strictly consulting with Lot Smith, Jesse N. Smith, the Bishops and leading Mormons of Arizona.And the next Election we should have all the County Offices of Apache Co.Our people have legal votes enough to carry it. My feelings would be to elect asa Delegate to Congress one who would be the best man, (if there is any best) andthe one that would do us the most good; but the Mormons must all unite upon thismatter, there should be no divisions with any of the brethren upon this point.With regard to your entry of the land of St. John, I have conversed withPrest. Taylor and he thinks I should consult a lawyer upon this subject, and Iwill send you instructions what to do Therefore take no further action until youhear from me upon the subject. Perhaps we can enter a townsite under the ArizonaLaws, if not we will have to pre-empt. I do not want to trust to homestead, itwill take too long But we have got to have honest men, if we can find them, toenter the land. But I will send you word as soon as I can get it.There is another subject I was somewhat surprised at, that is the price ofthe claim of the upper ditch, for I understood when you made the purchase thatyou had all the water and land except a small upper ditch that Barths chargedcows for, and when there was a failure in the purchase the 50 cows was knockedoff. Now they want $7,500 for the purchase, which amounts to a bout two thirds asmuch as all the first purchase that is something I do not understand.Still, we as a people ought to own all of the land and water we can get, aswe want as little mixture with the outside as we can help. I shall do what I canto send men and means. But many who were opposed to going make but slow headway.I have spoken to the brethren about appointing David Udell -[David K. Udall]- forBishop of St. John and have had no opposition to it yet.I realize that you want more Missionaries to go among the Lamanites and Iwill do what I can to help send men. I am glad you have good prospects for a crop,and that you have a chance to turn in barley. I think it is a fair price.How do the brethren do about holding the claims on the meadow? Remember mekindly to J. W. Young if he is with you and say to him that I have written him and shall write again soon.Remember me to your family and all the Saints with you. I remain yourbrother in the Gospel.W. Woodruff 
 LeSueurSalt Lake City May 26, 1881Elder A. M. Tenney,Dear Brother: Your letter of March 11, 1881, is before me and I write to answerit. I was glad to hear that all things were as favorable as theyare in the payment of the St. John purchase. We have called something like ahundred men to go to St. John this season. How many will reach there I do notknow. I hope it will be occupied by the Saints, so that the Gentiles will not wishto be there. I saw from a letter from Bishop Udall, that arrangements were madeto enter a good deal of the land in the purchase. This I was pleased to see forI have considered this very important.Now BrotheSr Tenney, concerning your remarks upon the railroad contracts, Iwish to say that the Presidency of the Church were not anxious for our peopleto engage in the railroad business at all, but as so many were anxious to engagein it, the Presidency and the Twelve both felt that it was important that someof the Quorum should be appointed to go to Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado andpreside over the organization of our people in these territories who were engagedin the building of these railroads, and Erastus Snow, B. Young, J. W. Young andJesse N. Smith were appointed a committee to go to these territories and organizethe camp, and to direct and control all contracts made upon that railroad and seethat all camps of the Saints attend to their prayers and observe the Sabbath andto see that all labor get their pay. They received strict written instructionswhat to do, and E. Snow and B. Young went to Arizona for that purpose, but nobodycomplied with the instructions, and the consequence is that John W. Young wascalled to Salt Lake City and the Twelve and the Presidency have sat for days ininvestigating this subject, and the final decision is that John W. Young and allthe others must abide by their instructions and take counsel in the matter ifthey maintain their standing in the Church of Jesus Christ of LatteSr-day Saints.John W. Young has agreed to do this, to throw all of his contracts intotheir hands and to carry it on under their united counsel. And I would advise youand every other elder in the church, who are taking contracts upon that railroad,who are employing the Saints to work under them, to do as John W. Young has done,to take their counsel in these matters. If you are not satisfied with yoursettlement with J. W. Young, I would advise you to have E. Snow and B. Young tosettle it between you.Another subject I wish to speak upon and that is the Lamanite Mission.I had a great deal of confidence in you in this matter, as you had the Spanishand were qualified to labor there, and I was in hopes that you would be able tocarry that mission. But it seems that you are engaged in the railroad businessand I do not know whether you will ever by at liberty to do anything upon thatmission. You wished me to appoint somebody else to preside and you would workwith them, but I thought you the best qualified to preside over it of any onethere. But as you have resigned, I told Brother Snow to accept of your resignation,if you could not attend to it, and appoint some one in your place so that the mis-sion may not be given up, for I do consider the salvation of that people of moreimportance than building railroads or getting rich.I am always glad to hear from you. Remember me kindly to your family and toBrother Udall, if you see him.Your brother in the Gospel.W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City May 27, 1880Ammon M. TenneySt. Johns, Apache Co., ArizonaDear Bro.I have consulted with lawyers and friends about entering the St. Johns purchase and after getting all the information we can, we have come to the conclusion that the safest, best and cheapest way is to enter the land by quarter sections. It is very difficult to enter a townsite and we have to pay a good deal more to the Government and it takes all together too long to home-stead.If you have not used your entry right, I would like you to enter the Quarter which is of the most value and then put trusty men to enter the rest. Those who enter will have to claim a house or shanty of some kind, until they pay for it, and get a Government title before they can deed to others. You will want to find out the sections, stakes, half sections and quarter sections, so as not to make any mistakes about the land you enter. All persons will have to go to Prescott to enter the land.You will want to learn the Township, Range Plot Section, so as not to make a mistake in the entry.I enclose a letter to J. W. Young, which I will not seal for I have an order in it for several persons who paid tithing to J. W. Young, and they may be with you, some of them. I want you to see that they have credit on the tith-ing books, of whatever ward they may be in, as I do not know where John W. is, I trust to you to send the letter to him.I wish now to say that we decided in Council last night to send David Udell -[ David K. Udall ]- to preside as Bishop at St. Johns., L. John Nuttall will notify him. I have tried ever since I came, to get him appointed as Bishop of that place, but I did not get it accomplished until last night.I shall be glad to hear from you from time to time to know how you progress. My love to your family and all the Saints with you and please excuse a short letter now.Your brother in the GospelW. Woodruff

Tenney,Dear Brother:I have just received your two letters and read them to Brother Taylor, and our counsel is for you today, to those brethren who are at St. John, who are taking land, that our counsel to them is to turn out in payment for the land, oxen, horses, wagons, harness, or anything they have to help pay for it, and not wait for the last day of payment.I have written to you concerning the election. We want you to consult with the presidents of stakes and their counsellors, the bishops and counsellors, and all the people must unite together and agree whom they will vote for as delegate to Congress, and then all write and vote for your county officers. The Mormons have a great majority of votes in Apache County, and it is a duty they owe to themselves to put their own men into office. You write to Lot and to Jesse N. Smith and consult with them about it. The people must be united and not divide in these matters.I have already notified you that we have appointed David Wall, -[ David K. Udall ]- as bishop of St. John and he has been notified of it. How soon he can go I know not. You should reserve a good city lot and farming land for him. You can ask him when he can come.I am surprised that you have received so little pay on the purchase for the number of men. All should understand that they cannot hold that land if they do not pay for it, for it was bought for the Saints, but we expect them to pay for it.If you are likey to have trouble with the Apaches, you should all form yourselves into a military company without delay and see that your arm and ammunition are in good order and ready at hand.I thought all matters were settled between Brothers Hunt and Hatch. They agree(d) to settle and bury everything (the) night of the settlement.I am now notifying some men at Box Elder City to prepare to go to St. John. We will send men as fast as we can.You need not call for any tithing stock to pay on the St. John purchase, unless you are obliged to. I was sorry to hear that Brother Johnson had made such a poor -[choice]- out of his settling. I told him to go to St. John. Men who take counsel will be blessed. Those who do not will suffer.I have only time to write a little this evening. My love to all.Your brother in the Gospel, W. Wroodruff per J. J. 
 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona Feb. 19th 1880To the Latter-day Saints in St. John District:Bleoved Brethren:We have met in council at Sunset, and taken into consideration the situationof the town and land purchased by A. M. Tenney, and we have put a ^the^ price of the farming land $8.00 per acre: and the City Lots at $25.00 on an average; and wehave named our town "St. John," for it is at St. John. And we wish it distinctlyunderstood, by the Saints who settle there that we do not expect to enter intoany speculation in the purchase of this country, for ourselves or our Brethren.Our labors in these matters are for the building-up of Zion, and the settlingof the Saints. We have figured this matter as closely as we can, and we feel thatwe cannot put the land and lots at any lower price. When the land and lots are soldand the debts paid, if there is anything left, it will be returned, pro. rata, tothose who have paid for the land: and if we fall short of the payment, we considerit right and just that those who have purchased the land, shall also pay, pro. rata.to help pay the debt: but we expect the price set, will pay for the land. Bro.Ammon M. Tenney was appointed to make this purchase, and we look to him to deal outthis land, both city lots and farming land, to those who buy: the payments to bemade to him. He is held responsible for the fulfilment of the contracts. We wouldlike all of the Brethren that he calls upon to assist him in any matter appertainingto the settling of the place. We wish further to be understood that Brother Tenneyhas been appointed to preside over the settlement of St. John, and to preside overall meetings when he is present, until he is released from his responsibilities.We also appointed Brother Tenney to preside over the Lamanite Mission; the thereason that he has already opened the doors among many of the Eastern Villages,and is quite well versed in Spanish.We have also appointed Brother J. Allred to assist Bro. Tenney, under hisdirection, and to preside over the meetings in Bro. Tenney's absence, until theyare more fully organized. And we wish all the Brethren who take land, to do whatthey can, at once, to assist in the payment of the same. We have advised Bro.Tenney in relation to the Missionaries associated with him, as regards theirraising grain for the season, concerning which he will instruct you.W. Woodruff John W. Young

WoodruffSalt Lake City.Dear Brother:I sent a copy of the Liverpool Daily Post to Prest Snow,F. D Richards & Bro Jno. containing a report of the mobbing of some "Mormon" Elders, through the report of a woman that the Elders had decoyed away her daugh-ter who had returned, with two children and had to walk from Liverpool to London &c. Well from advices received from London we learn that the Elders did not preach in that place, but they held an open air meeting in Mile End Road and had a splendid good meeting and was listened to with a good deal of attention. I suppose this is the way the adversary is educating his children to mob the Saints. In my inquiries about copyright and the regis-tering at Stationers Hall I have come ac-cross the following "A copyright extends to 42 years." Elder C. W. Symons and D. H. Snarr, who are laboring in London, went to Stationers Hall and obtained the 
 following information "The Doctrine and Covenants was registered at Stationers Hall, June 7, 1845, by Wilford Woodruff of Stanley Buildings, Bath St Liverpool.These brethren are searching to find out the copyrighting of all our Church works.They could find nothing of the Book of Mormon. The officials at Stationers Hall said if it was first published in America, it could not be registered there.They also assert that the Doctrine and Covenants was registered June 7, 1845 and published June 15, 1845 eight days after being registered and therefore gives it no protection. The charge for searching is one shilling a letter, it being arranged in letters. They searched through two letters from 1840 to 1873. They could not find The Book of Mormon or HymnBook. Prest Leaing is giving it his attention and I hope before long to get all the information we want. We are all well and rejoicing in the truth. With kindest regards.Your brother in the CovtGeo.

Hays and some of the Elders from Utah.We held a Priesthood Meeting oin the everning. There were fifteen Elders from Utah and several of the local Presidents of Branches and local priesthood.On Sunday we held three meetings. On Monday a meeting with the Utah elders in the morning and in the evening I preached at Hucknall Torkard. Yesterday after visiting at Hucknall I went to Mansfield and held a meeting Elders H. H. Shurtliff, H Y Tilley and myself doing the preaching. We had a most excellent time. This conference is in an excellent condition.On Saturday last Elders L. A. Cannon, E. L.Sloan and his sister left for Utah pr. Guion S.S. Nevada. When we received your cablegramwe notified these brethren and on the following day for the departure of a Guion Co. Steamship they left for home. Bro. E L Sloan seemed ra-ther disappointed to have to return before the completion of his mission, but Bro. Cannon having 
 been away from home over two years and a quarter was happy of the privilege of returning. The Lord has kindly encouraged some of the brethren by giving them some precious souls for their hire and seals for their ministry that has caused them to rejoice and take courage in their labors. I returned this afternoon full of thanksgiving to God for all His mercies received a most excellent letter from folks ^at^ Nephi and rejoiced in His matchless love and kindness. In Sundays Chronicle there is a piece call-ed "Dying Mormonism" which I enclose that you may see how the people are being educated (?)with regard to the Work of God. How ready the peo-ple are to believe false prophets. If the "recruits from Europe" where as benighted and ignorant as this "Travelling Correspondent", they may well be pitied.These wiseacres speak as they would wish it to be,but fortunately for the human family and the righteous in particular it is Babylon that is doomed and every plant that the Father has not planted and not His Church or the Gospel of the Kingdom. It is mail time and our ^Wednesday^ even-ing meeting so I must conclude. I am happy to report we are all well in health and spirits.With kindest love to yourself, counsellors, bretherenof our Quorum and those associated with you I remain as everYour brother in patienceGeorge Teasdale

Last Sunday I met with the Elders and Saints in the Welsh Mission in a Conference held at Merthyr and we had a very profitable time. The anti "mormons" tried to annoy and break up our meeting, but signally failed. There were 20 Elders from Utah and we had an exceedingly 
 pleasant time in our Priesthood meetings.  Tomor-row Sunday the 22nd we hold Conference at Norwich. In our searchings after the copy right-ing of our Church Works we do not seem very hap-py but we discover enough to be assured of the absurdity of the claim of the Pratt family. The key to Theology was copyrighted in March 1855 by Franklin D. Richards of 15 Wilton St Liverpool.the day of the month does not appear on the records.

October 23rd 1889.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, U. T.My dear brother:On Sunday last I attended a Conference of the Saints in the Leeds Conference which was held at Dewsbury about 9 miles from Leeds. The Conference House is at Armley, two miles from Leeds. The only train we could use left Leeds at 6.45 a m So we had to walk from Armley to Leeds in the Early morning and it pouring down rain. We got wet, it was cold and cheerless. When we ar-rived at Dewsbury it was about 7.30, no Saints in the town and the Hall engaged from 10 a.m. SWe stayed in the waiting room until Prest  Tuckett went to the Hall to Ascer-tain if we could find a shelter until 10 a. m as it was raining. It being Sunday morning and but few trains running there was no fire in the waiting room, we walked under the cover of the station on the platform to keep ourselves warm. Arrangements being made we went to the Hall a fine cConcert Hall capable of holding some thousand people, with side rooms for cloak & hat rooms &c. The Elders and Saints had taken a picnic, for all places of business were 
 closes, it being a very religious town where the peo-ple were supposed to strictly keep the Sabbath. The janitor of the Hall did all in his power to make the people comfortable supplying plates cups & saucers, hot water &c which some-what added to the comfort of the people. We held three meetings. In the morning it was very cold, no fires and we got somewhat chilled. In the afternoon the gas was lit to ptemper the atmos-phere and we had some 118 strangers. I felt quite unwell, took a chill and had every symptoms of fever & cold. I remarked to Prest Tuckett I was afraid I should not be able to talk much in the evening when I was ex-pected to occupy most of the time. When even-ing came we had some 200 strangers and after the evening singing & prayer I arose to speak feeling pretty miserable and having nothing to say. I commence tremblingly, but the Spirit of the Lord came upon me and I preached in power for about 70 minutes, and was entirely healed. All the miserable feeling left me and I was as well as ever I was in my life. I was enabled to bear a strong testimony to the truth of Joseph Smiths mission and to plead with the people to investigate the prin-ciples, we taught, with a prayerful heart. My subject was man's relationship with God and the necessity of the principles of the Gospel & Atonement

Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:Your favor of the 23rd ult was received and read with much pleasure and I have deemed it wisdom to publish it in part for the encouragement of the Elders that they may redouble their efforts and work whilst the day lasts. Prest Fjeldsted writes us under date of Sep. 21stas follows "It is with regret that I must inform you that we are meeting with quite an oppo-sition in the Aalborg Conference, as also oin Bornholm, from which places now several of the Elders have been banished so I have for athe time being compelled to withdraw the missionaries from Bornholm and send the one (bro E. Kofford), under banishment, to Norway where also a brother Nielsen from Aalborg Conf[eren]ce had to go a few weeks ago, and now Bro. C. K. Hansen, President of Aalborg Conf[eren]ce is also banished and Bro L. C. Johnson expects to get papers served on him in a few days,but I have changed him to another Con-ference so perhaps he can evade the officers and remain in Denmark. The police are also seeking after the other brethren now laboring 
 In the afternoon I explained why we partook of the Sacrament and what we considered essential before we could consistently do so. Elder John B. Milner & his wife attended Conference. Bro Milner spoke in the after-noon for about half an hour and bore an excellent testimony, was exceedingly interesting, and listened to with rapt attention. We had a fine successful conference seven Elders from Utah Prest Hy Tuckett, Abraham Maw, Rosel H. Hunter, Thos H. Blackburn, Wm J. Critchlow Jno B. Milner & myself. Bro's A. Maw & Hunter have been successful under the blessing of God of organizing a branch in Hull and bap-tizing twenty two souls. They have pretty much to sustain themselves in that Conference, Saints few and far between. When I returned to 42 I found your telegram relating to Bro D. M. McAllister and must say I am exceedingly sorry to part with him. I told him he had better leave with this Company on the 26th but he said he could not in justice as he would have to see to all the business connected with the Company but he would leave the following Saturdayand then he would be able to arrive in 
 in Aalborg Conf[eren]ce and if found will of course also be banished." Prest Fjeldsted also says "Outside from these troubles we enjoy peace in the other parts of the mission and the brethren are meeting with encouraging success in various places." He also informs me he has sent a native elder to Preside in Alalborg. We have had some little encouragement also. Last Sun-day I attended an excellent Conference of the Norwich Conf[eren]ce. There was five to have been baptized but through some misunderstanding two men did not meet with the others, but three were baptized and confirmed. In the Scottish Mission also there have been some baptisms. Next Sunday I expect to attend a Conference of that Mission in Glasgow. We have the half yearly statistical reports of the Conferences of the British Mission and find (193) one hundred and ninety three baptisms (155) one hundred and fifty five emigrated (53)fifty three excommunicated and (23) twenty three died; a decrease of (66) sixty six to the mission (3230) Thirty two hundred and thirty, officers and members comprise the British Mission, good & bad. We have just published our Book of Mor-mon Ad broadcast, as much as to tell the people what the Book of Mormon is as to make business and so leave them without excuse. We have sold some we should not have done if we 
 the City about as soon as they would. When you send a cable gram to send anyone home immediately I should let them go without any regard to business. You know I am a minute man, but I cannot force anyone away. Bro Mac is a man of faith and trust in God, he is as calm as a summer's morning, and is turning over the business every day to the understand-ing of Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been as-sisting in the office during Emigration, and he is getting his things together to pack up and leave as cheerful and unconcerned as if it had been arranged for him to go and there had been no telegram. Bro. McAllister is a man of God one of natures noblemen, humble faithful and true. I have lived with him here two years and a third and can say that he improves upon acquaintance. We have in the office with us at present Bro S. T. Whitaker who leaves on Saturday for home and a brother George F. Phillips a youngman of excellent family   as the world goes  and good education. He is about 23 years of age. His parents are Catholics, mother is dead, 
 had not advertized but not enough to pay us in a financial point. We keep pushing our business to try and sell books. Our next venture is a cheap edition of the Hymn Book so all our children and young people as well as grown people, can have one for one shilling. Our cheap edition of the Book of Mormon for two shillings and our Voice of Warning for sixpence has been quite a success in spreading the know-ledge of the gospel and the scriptures. The blessing of the Lord has been with us. He put it into our hearts to publish these cheap editions and He has prosper-ed us in our labors. I hope for the sake of the work and of the people the elders will not be withdrawn from the nationsuntil He says it is enough. There is a pleasure in laboring for the Lord, in la-boring for Zion, if it is uphill business, or rowing against the stream, with all its discouragement it has its lights and shadows, its joys and sorrows. The exper-ience the elders gain is invaluable in fact it is priceless. It could not be gained under any other circumstances. Elder W. P. Payne was 
 His grand father on his mothers side was a Jew. He has always been religiously inclined and educated in the Catholic Church speaks French, Latin and is an organist, educated to be a physician. He was assistant organist at a Catholic Church. Of late he has been dissatisfied with the Catholic Church and had some interviews with a popular protestant evangelist, but was disgusted with the Come to Jesus declarations of this gentleman and concluded the Catholic Church was better than that. It happened that the Priest of the Church where bro Phillipswas assistant organist saw him walking with and in conversation with the Evan-gelist, and one evening after vespers when Bro P had been playing, the organist being absent, the priest came to him and asked him what he was talking to the evangelist for, and Bro Phillips told him he was in-quiring into his faith and principles. The Priest sharply reprimanded him and Bro P. defended himself and told the priest he was far from being satisfied with the Catho-lic Church. This added fuel to the fire, he was told that to doubt was to be damned &c and en-ded by cursing him and discharging him 
 unwilling to return he made a most excellent missionary. And as a general thing all the Elders say when spoken to about their releaseor released "Just as you say Bro. Teasdale" we are in the hands of the Lord." This is the result of intelligence, they know this is the Work of the Lord that we are engaged in and that theirre is an order in His Curhurch and feel safe in sustaining that order. Your letter concerning the release of Bro. A Judd has been re-ceived. We have telegraphed him for the 5th of October Company if he can get ready. He will be missed in the Hol-land mission. Bro. Brown writes me he does not know what to do with the last three missionaries who have been appointed to Holland as they cannot speak the language and it takes a year before they can be of any service to the mission He is in want of elders who can go into the field and push the sale of the Book of Mormon and be an immediate help to him. Our good friend Mr Ramsden has just apprized us of the accident that happened to the Wisconsin Company that Bro. W. P. Payne had charge of. Is it 
 from the situation of assistant organist. He was occupying a position as assistant to a physician as he was training for the medical profession. One day he saw a scrap of a newspaper with a letter from a Mormon Elder writen on it. He had al-ways believed the Mormons were a wicked people. He was impressed to inquire about them and he wrote to the Glasgow Mail to make inquiry about the location of the "Mormons" in Glasgow where he could gain information concerning them and theydirected him to the "Millennial Star Office" and he wrote for information. We sent him some tracts and referred him to President S. T. Whittaker. A correspondence was open between them and Bro Whitaker let him have some tracts and he got quite interested One day he went out to visit a sick child leaving one of the tracts on the desk. During his absence the physician he was with saw the tract and read some of it and when Bro P. returned he censured him exceedingly for reading such stuff Bro P. defended himself and the princi-ples advocated in the tract and this led to the his dismissal from the physicians employ. Up to this time he had not been 
 not wonderful that no one was killed or crippled in such a terrible smash up? Sure-ly it is another evidence of the matchless love and power of God manifested in theprotection of His people. It is marvellous! Mr Ramsden has also caused the Post to insert another paragraph concerning that canard they published about "Mob-bing Mormon Missionaries" Mr Ramsden says in a letter to me "I sent one of the copies of the "Star" to the Daily Post and asked them not to give you the trouble of inserting such articles for the future I think it will do them good and make them more care-ful in future." Mr Ramsden is our true friend. I often think if we were all as faith-ful in our sphere as he is in his we would all do pretty well. And this man cannot see the truth as the Saints have the privilege but if he was a member of the Church he could not treat our people better than he does. I should like to know if the Post would have published that at our request? I doubt it very much for it has always been very bitter towards our people. I am happy to say we are all 
 baptized he was only investigating read-ing and attending meetings. When it was known he was investigating and likely to embrace the mormon faith it caused the greatest consternation. The priest was sent to reason with him his father persuaded him but he stood his ground got cursed by the priest and disowned by his father. He had asked for baptism but had been put off to be more enlightened, count the cost &c Bro Whitaker seeing what a cross he was taking up was slow to baptize him. However as there were some converted to the truth who disired Bro.Whitaker to baptize them before he left Bro Philips was baptized same time. A number of strangers were present at the baptism and confirnation. Through this step Bro Phillips father has turned his back upon him, would not speak to him not even to say good bye. They kept his clothes. He came here with Bro Whitaker to see me. He wrote me to say he was willing to do anything the Lord had for him to do. I saw him and 
 well in body and mind. We thank you very kindly for your faith and prayers and for the prayers of your counsellor's and the Twelve, for they are certainly answered. Jarman & Co are continuing their lectures because there is money in it, but they seem to have lost their influence. We are letting them severely alone and this seems the best way to do. The Lord is certainly able to do His own work, and from the very fact that He has allowed Jarman & Co. to travel and vilify His people for so many years is an evidence that it is for a purpose hereafter to be developed. With kindest love to the First Presidency, The Twelve and all associated with youand with continual prayers for your wel-fare and blessingI remain, as ever,Your brother in the gospelGeorge Teasdale 
 conversed with him at the Conference of the Scottish Mission, he was not in the Church then. I had intended to let him go into the field and labor to give him an experience but I find him so useful that he has been assisting us in the office this week. Your much valued favor of the 25th ult came safe to hand and read with much interest. I regret exceedingly that you lent Bro. Galbraith any money. He was going to work his way to Utah. He did work his passage across the sea. He appeared to me to have been brought into the Church for a wise purpose in the Lord and seemed to be an honest man. I should not have taken the liberty to introduce him to you if I had dreamed he would have taken an undue advantage of the introduction. He expressed himself as desiring to spend his life in the service of God and teach the young, preach the Gospel and labor anyhwere he might be of use. I only wanted you to see him and if you thought proper and there was a va-cancy in some of the coutown or country set-tlements where he gcould get an experience after he had got located that he might have the chance of it   But I am ashamed of having written so long a letter so will conclude withKindest love from all to all your brother in the Gospel Geo.

On Thursday evening, the 24th inst, whilst we were holding a fellow-ship meeting in the prayer room at 42 with the returning missionaries and some of the Saints, a number of missionaries arrived per GuionS. S. Arizona. F. C. Mickleson, J. P. Olsen, John Johnson & Ole Olsen for Scandinavia Orson Merrill Edward Peay, Ezra C. Rich, Chas R. Lyman, W. B. Gibbons. 
 for the British B. Heertjes, for the Holland, and John Schweizer, for the Swiss & German Missions. Those for England are appointed as follows E. C. Rich and Chas R. Lyman to Birmingham, Edward Peay to Leeds, W. B. Gibbons to Norwich and Orson Merrill to the Newcastle Conferences. There were also some visitors O. P. Arnold, C. S. Burton & wife, T. Williams, Mrs Jane Ferguson & daughter Mary and Mrs Morse sister in law to Bro RdMorse now presideing over the Welsh Mission. There are some few persons left who wish to emigrate, but who have not been able to get ready with our companies; so to prevent anyone being disappointed we have arranged to send them on the 16th of November pr Guion S. S. Nevada. Our Brother McAllister leaves on Saturday per. Guion S. S. Arizona, and we are exceedingly sorry to part with him. I wish he could have finished up the year with us. Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been assisting us in the office during the emigration sea-son, will hold the books until the successor of Bro. McAllister arrives. He should be a good accountant and business man. Bro Macallister has been first class help, and he is a gentleman and Latter-day Saint who appreciates the honor and privilege of being a citizen of the Kingdom of God and a standing in the Church of Christ, which many do not seem to sense, I am sorry to say. 
 Brother George F. Phillips, of whom I wrote you in my last of the 23rd inst, is still with us. I have not had any conversations with him but have let him take his own course. He has been keeping in the office. He bore a very good straitforward testimony on Sunday at our testimony meeting, and seems to feel very well in the Church. He has made covenant with the Lord by sacrifice indeed. This is an evidence to us how capable God is of per-forming His own work and bringing the seed of Israel into His fold. How many have beenled by a scrap of paper into His Church I see by the papers that our Quorum has been fil-led, which is a satisfaction to me because I think at the advanced stage of the work we ought to learn our duty to God and in-quire of Him to know who He wishes to fill vacancies. I recognize we are the Church of Christ and the order of that Church. You are the head of the High Priesthood the chief apostle of the Church of Christ and have a right to the revelations of God. We all sustain you as a prophet, seer and revelator and ask God to reveal His mindand will unto you that His will may be done. We all want the will of God done not ours or anyone elses' but His will. It is His 
 Church we are members of, He is our Father in Heaven, our God and Redeemer, all we have we owe to Him, all we ever expect to enjoy we look to Him for, and it is natural we should be jealous for Him, that He may be sought after, inquired of, honored and obeyed. He has established His Church and He is going to extablish His kingdom with those who love Him and delight to serve Him, and who are jealous for Him. We have been a Church long enough to know something of the order of His appointing and for one I say let His order be honored and let Him be inquired of and He will direct. This is just what we are all praying for that His will may be done on earth as in heaven I say Amen with all my heart because this is just what I truly want to see. It matters little to me whom the Lord calls, for I am a brother and friend of every man who is a Latter-day Saintin good standing and full fellowship in the Church of Christ. There are so many good and competent men to day who are capable under the blessing of God of fulfilling any poition to which they might be called, but they want to be just werethe Lord wants them and to do just what He wants them to do and would not wish for any position only as they are called by Him, knowing they are all the same in His sight and their labors of equal value all working for the same recompense. 
 of reward viz Endless lives in His glorious presence. If it is a strait and narrow way it is open to all who love God and delight to keep His commandments; members of all quorums being equally honorable. For it is not the position that makes the man, or ^is^ a sureity of success, but it is the man of God who is humble, childlike, true and faithful, enjoying the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, who makes the position an honor-able one in any quorum or in any position. The man who honors God is honored by Him in whatsoever calling or responsi-bility he is called to, Priests of the order of Aaron often being blessed in a most miraculous manner on account of their faith and good works. I am thankful for the men God has given us to be our com-panions in our Quorum and hope we shall be one with each other, and as a Quorum, and with the First Presidency, that we may be Christs', that we may be sanctified by the Truth, and he the servants of God in very deed. May the Holy Ghost be our con-stant companion that we may all see eye to eye and be a blessing to the House of Israel. May we be humble and full of love possessing 
 faith, hope and charity, being temperate in all things intrusted in our care, working out our own salvation and laboring with an eye single to the glory of God. This is my prayer, and if I had the power to confer a blessing upon the heads of my fellow ser-vants ^this^ would be the blessing I would confer upon all, with deepest love and fraternal affection. God bless the First Presidency and God bless the Twelve and unite them toge-ther as the heart of one, to bless and be blessed, and set a righteous example to all quorums, and to all Israel for brotherly love, humility, faith, hope and charity to the glory of God the Father is the prayer of His unworthy servant. With kindest love to allI remain as everYour brother & fellow laborerGeorge Teasdale.

T.Dear Brother:On Saturday last our Brother McAllister left Liverpool per. Guion S. S. Arizona. Such sudden changes are never very pleasant, especially with book keepers. Whenyour telegram reached us we were in the midst of the business of shipping off a company of Saints. Bro. Mc Allister has worked assiduously to get his books posted up and in some shape to hand over to Brother L. R. Thomas so that he could hold them and carry on the business until Bro. McAllisters' successor should be sent. Bro Mc set up the whole of Friday night working to have the accounts in good condition. Bro. Thomas is doing very well for a young man as you will see from the Balance Sheets for October. As you will soon see Bro. Mac he will give you quite a history of our doings and hand you a very handsome-ly bound large sized Book of Mormon for the Tabernacle and a Psalmody. We furnish the unbound copies and Mr Fazackerly binds them free of charge. They are exceedingly handsome and will be a pleasant souvenire 
 from old 42 Islington and our friend Fazackerly.Your greatly esteemed favors of Oct 19 and 17th have come safe to hand. The reason why Elder L. A. Kelsch did not go to Turkey was because he could not get a passport. It is no use anyone coming here without a passport, for they cannot ob-tain one in this country. Bro. Kelsch tried all he could and made it a subject of prayer but was refused and that is why we put him into the fieldHe wrote home to try and get a passport but failedSo we have appointed him President of the Bris-tol Conference where he is laboring at present.I have received letters from J. M. Sjodahl and W. H. Smart wishing to be released from the Turkish Mission through sickness. Bro.Smart writes that Bro Socander is down sick also. I enclose their letters and shall be pleased to know what to do. A few days ago I sent ( 6.0.0) six pounds and an en-couraging letter to Bro Sjodahl. Bro. W. H. Smart has never had much faith in the mission since he has been there. Bro Stauffer is the only one who seems to be really doing anything. The last letter I got from Bro Hintze he seemed to be doing but little in Constantinople. He wanted  10.0.0 to get some letters or articles into the Newspaper as he could not get any printing done. With kind regards Your brother in the gospel George Teasdale 
 Br. Woodruff. Mothers, Daughters, and Sisters in Zion,I feel happy to have the privilege of meeting with you, but think it a difficult matter to speak to such a congregation.It requires the spirit of God to speak and teach the sisters in their duties. God has taken the weak things of the world to confound the wise. Said that Joseph Smith organized the Female Relief Society as he did the church by revelation; that when he did organize this Society, he had an object in view; so also did the Lord.Spoke on fore-ordination: clearly showing that the Lord known unto his servants, those things that should come to pass down to the present day. The Lord has prepared people to carry on His purposes that would not be thwarted. Said the Lord had foreordained that these mothers should come forth in this day and gen-eration to raise up a people to carry on His work.That they had a mission just as important as the Brethren, but they must be co-workers with each other. Spoke at some length upon the sisters having the power to controll the fashions; did not care how beautifully we dressed, so that it was of comly and home-made. Encouraged the sisters to cooperate in these things untill we become independent of Babylon. Referred to Brigham City as an example in cooperation.Spoke at some length on selk culture, and showed the nescessity of cultivating the mulberry tree, and encouraged the sisters to enter into this with a will. Also spoke of the laying up of grain, in case of famine for it will surely come. Spoke of the power the sisters have in assisting to build temples and gather the poor. Spoke of the responsibility resting upon mothers in bearing children and training them to bear of this Kingdom.Said there is many trials attending the principle of Prural Marriage, but there is also the greatest blessings attending the same. Made some very pleasing remarks on this subject. Asked the blessings of God on all. Amen.

Islington, Liverpool.April 15th 1890President Wilford Woodruffand Council.Dear Brethren:On the 6th of AprilI attended a very good Conference of the Scot-tish Mission. Our priesthood meetings andassembly of the Saints were attended verysatisfactory and an excellent spirit prevailed. Last Sunday I attended the NewcastleConference and had quite a number ofstrangers attend. Although but few baptismsthe Elders have much joy in their labors. Last week Elders Carlisle, Fraser, the YoungBrothers and others arrived and received theirappointments as you will see from the MillennialStar9. On Saturday the 12th inst. Elders W. H. Smart and Richard Yeates left here forhome per S. S. AlaskaYour favor of March 22nd received. I had readin the Deseret News that two dollars was to be al-lowed the passengers from New York to Utah forprovisions, and could not understand it, butyour letter explains that this two dollars is to helppay provisions on the railroad and incidentalexpenses." I am afraid this will cause someconfusion. If two dollars is to be returned to the 
 passengers, would it not be easier to chargethem $60 sixty dollars and thus save any fur-thur trouble. The presidents of the Companieshave much to do already and to have theresponsibility of giving every passenger twodollars at New York or a part of two dollarsafter some necessary expenses have been paidwill increase his labors and make him a tar-get for the passengers to accuse and find faultwith. I think we should do all we could toprevent confusion and guard against givingroom for complaint. I was sorry when I readthe notice in the News that two dollars wasto be spent in provisions. If it had been sixtydollars for the fare and understood as here-tofore they have to provide themselves provis-ions over the R Road, they do it. But if theyknow two dollars is to be given them at NewYork for provisions they will think thatis sufficient for the journey and look tothe President to provide them. He has hadto do this ^for some^ on several occasions in the past andhave so reported to this office. We have to dealwith a jealous people and it is a thanklessposition to have to serve them. I have hadan experience with them for years and have not wondered when men apostatisedbecause of the people. The best way to handlethem is strait and give them no chance for

With regard to Thomas Galbraith I am sorry for him because he has been over come by the power of the adversary. I am satisfied he had a desire to serve God. He was going to work his way to Utah. He never asked me for any money. When I found he was deter-mined to go I thought the matter over and talked it over with Bro. McAllister and thebrethren here. One morning, before I said anything to Galbraith, I told the brethren I had concluded to offer him a loan to help him across the continent, for I thought he was honest. He had been told he would have to meet difficulties, that he was going to a new country where he was unknown and he would meet with people who would en-deavor to poison his mind, to discourage him and lead him out of the Church; but he was prepared for this he had read a great deal against the people, but he knew he

[end of sideways text]LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool.April 19th 1890.President Wilford Woodruff,and Council.Dear Brethren:A small company, the first of the season, left here this morning,per Guion Steam Ship Wisconsin, under the presidency of Elder Orson H. Worthington, with Edward A. Cottrell and Daniel H. Snarr as his counsellors, and Thos. E. Bassett clerk and recorder. The following named brethren returning missionaries, Timothy B. Davis, Jenkyn Thomas,T. E. Ricks Jr, Joseph H. Ward and E. L.Burgoyne. The company consisted of 43 soulswithout counting the missionaries. 32 full fares 4 halves 6 between 1 & 5 years and 1 infant = 43 souls 9 missionaries = 52. 19 were for Salt Lake City, 7 for Ogden, 2 for Nephi 7 for Provo, 1 for Evanston, 11 for Market Lake Idaho, 3 for Farmington, 1 for Logan, and 1 for Montpellier = 52.As we have received no advices concerning the fares north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork, we have been obliged to guess at it, and have ad-ded the difference we paid last year to the places north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork not knowing what better to do. According to your instructions we have made out the lists at $45.25/100 fortyfive dollars and twentyfive cents and opened an account with 
 had a work to do, and was willing to devote himself to the service of the Divine Master, and prepared for the difficulties and quoting scrip-ture, with which he seemed to be familiar, that the Saints would have to suffer tribulation.When I spoke to him I told him I thought himan honest man, and had come to the conclu-sion to loan him sufficient to pay his overland journey personally. I told him I did not know why I did it, because I had little faith in men,my experience had taught me that there was agreat deal of dishonesty in men, and that he need not thank me, but thank God who had softened my heart towards him to take a step I was not in the habit of doing. I told him the difficulties he would have to meet with, and that he had to establish a character amongst a people who would naturally look upon him with suspicion, because so many frauds had imposed upon them,that they wanted to know men before they were willing to invite them into theirfamilies. Galbraith heard me lecture to a Scandinavian Company, who were leaving here for Zion, telling them in my plain flat-footed way, what they might expect and the experience they would meet. And he said to me, no one could misunderstand that, and he was struck with the disposition 
 suspicion or to think they do not receive whatthey ought to receive and accuse an innocentman who happens to be their servant. I know you will pardon me for this suggestion. I only know to honestly give you my viewswhich are the result of my experience and submit them to your consideration, andthen I shall do just as you say. Withthis company that leaves here on Saturdaynext, the 19th inst, we shall give the Presidentof the company two dollars for every adultpassenger to pay expenses and furnishsome provisions. We shall instruct thebrethren with him to assist him all in theirpower. We have done so on previous occa-sions and have received word from the President of the Company that after theyleft Liverpool they took no further in-terest than to look after the Saints theywere more immediately interested in. Itis not all men who are willing to put them-selves out of the way for the convenience of others. I would suggest that if the pass-engers are to have a rebate of two dollarsthat it be given them here, on their leav-ing, and so save the President of the Com-pany, who has all he can attend to with-out this extra responsibility. I am sure the 
 the climate and he wanted to go home. We let him have the means to go as he was without and has promised faithfully to send it back to me as soon as he returns home. The Guion S.S. brings us a few missionaires and visitors. They landed here this morn-ing. The following are their names and appointments Thomas H. Woolford, to the London Conference Geo H. Robinson and Ether E. McBride to the Liverpool, Geo. Hanks, to the Bristol; Samuel Worsencroft, to the Manchester and Joseph Newbold to the Nottingham Conference; Jos S. Douglas to the Irish Mission.H. H. Akert for the Swiss & German, Ola Jenson L Dahlquist, L. J. Hernstrom, C. Olsen and Joseph R. Olsen for Scandinavia. Bro. Wm Langton and wife, Francis T. Bailey & wife, Captn J. D. Wright Doug-las Watson, Brother H. H. Thomas' wife and others whose names I have not yet got. All are in good health & spirits. They came by the S.S. Wisconsin and arrived to day. All but the missionaries have left for their destinations or friends where they are visiting.Bro J. E. Carlisle met with an accident which has somewhat lamed him. He was jammed between a tram and cab and bruised considerably. I am happy to say he has almost recovered. We learn from the papersthrough their American telegrams that "A consignment of Mormons landed at New York (14th) yesterday It is believed that these peo-ple are nothing more or less than contract laborers and it is the intention to raise that point when the next batch ofMormons is landed" This is going the rounds of the press. We are allwell at 42 & join in love. Your brotherGeo. Teasdale. 
 Mr R. Tenbroeck at these figures and have mail-ed him names and lists of full and half faresso he can have the tickets ready for the company on their arrival. We cabled you to-day "Fifty two sailed send Tenbroeck 1770 " The account figured at $45.25 for Passengers and missionaries was $1990.04We sent by Prest Worthington $22000 and cabled you for 1770 00/100 making $1990.04. We also gave the President of the Company (8600) Eighty six dollars to pay any necessary expenses and furnish some provisions on the journey. As an evidence of how this is understood he asked me if it could be used for provisions for the returning missionaries, or tipping the saloon stewards. To handle this emigration business re-quires experience. I do not know how we would have got along if we had a large company. It took the brethren all their time to manage this small company and sit up all night to do it, and they are good bookkeepers but not used to this busi-ness. With new hands on everything I am getting an experience in patience. Mr Ramsden is as kind and considerate as ever. Our returning mis-ionaries all had saloon passage, one of them the odd one, a cabin to himself. According to your wish we sent Bros. Ricks and Bassett, two good missionaries. There is a call for good help in nearly all the Conferences to fill the place of those leaving. With kind love to allI remain faithfully yours in the Kingdom of patienceGeorge Teasdale 
 Scandinavian brethren would have pre-ferred the fare being 6000 or 6100 sixty or sixty one dollars and all expenses paid andfind their own provisions, than the rebateOf course you may have some idea that assures you of the wisdom of therebate that I am unacquainted with, for I do not assume to have muchwisdom, I think sometimes I am verydull of comprehension and wish I had more wisdom and prudence, andcould see with clearer judgment. YetI do the best I can to my poor abilityand regret it is so poor.I am happy to say we useall reasonably well; The last attackI had gave me a severe shaking, butI am getting along wonderfully.

 to truthfulness as to the real state of affairs in Utah.Prest Woodruff you know we never offer any in-ducements, outside of the gospel of Christ. Wetell the people in Christ they will have peacebut in the world tribulation. No Elder ever of-fered any inducement to T. Galbraith to go to Zion by "false and cruel arguments." He went be-cause he wanted to go, and all the promises of tribulation, persecution and difficulties,could not deter him from going. He deceived us all. We all thought him an honest man:he possessed a testimony and enjoyed the Spirit of God, and God has been his friend and would have established him in His righteousness if he had not turned his back upon Him. Dear Brother Woodruff, there is nothing I have done I regret in this business except giving him an introduction to yourself.I humbly ask your pardon for so doing. It was done in haste without reflection and I cannot excuse myself. It is the first time I have been guilty of this unwarrantable liberty, you may depend upon it being the last. The suffering I have had in this unfor-tunate experience will certainly be a warning to me to never repeat it. The loss of the money advanced him I count a light thing.

 ance to us since he has been here. He is growing in-to the knowledge of the gospel, bears his testimony and is very humble and willing, does not expect any salary, and willing to go and preach the gospel. He is astonished at his own conversion, because he knows it has not been by the power, logic, or wisdom of man, and is convinced that the Lord has brought him into His Church and given him a testimony for some purpose and de-sires to fulfill anything He has for him to do.He has had quite a struggle with opposing in-fluences the pleading of his friends, and the change from having all the money he wanted to be without anything. We have not encoura-ged him at all or taken him into our con-fidence. We gave him 20/- to go home as he had been here some time and was feeling ra-ther blue and I thought if he had the means he would return, that perhaps he was to proud to ask his father after he had been so treated by him. But he did not go, and afterwards I learn-ed his sister had sent him word, she presumed he was cured of his folly by now, having found us out, and discovered what kind of people we were, and if he wished to return she would send him whatmoney he wanted. He has been quite a help to us since Bro. Brookbank has been sick. But if you would ra-ther that he should not work here, that is enough he will leave. With love, I am your brother,George Teasdale.

We telegraphed you this evening and calledfor 2000 dollars to be sent to Mr. Tenbroeck. Thereturning Missionaries and Saints were verycomfortably situated. Last Sunday I attendeda very good Conference in London which was wellattended. I am satisfied a good work is being169 + 52 = 221 
 It is very han[d]somly bound. Prest Brown ispushing the gospel in Holland, he wantsmore capable help. When the languagehas to be learned it is sometimes twelve toeighteen months before the Elders can preachthe gospel. He wants some help now. Thelast missionary Elder H. C. Gelderblom doesnot seem to take very well with his countrymen.The work in England is rather discouragingin baptisms and the indifference of the people.At a District Meeting held in the ManchesterConference, there was a good attendance. NextSunday I expect to attend a Conference of theLondon Conference. We are having a numberof visitors. Elder John W. Young his son Willieand David H. Cannon. They are in London atpresent. Bro Wm Langton & wife are in Manches-ter R. F. Neslen in Lowestoft all expect to bein London on Sunday, with several of the UtahElders and other visitors. Prest G. Q. Cannonhas telegraphed for Angus to return first steamerHe was expecting to leave by the June 7th Com-pany but we are trying to have him leave bythe "Arizona" next Saturday. We are all prettywell considering. We have just received the newsof the death of Elder James Picton of Nephi whichhas been very much of a shock and surprise tous. With kind love I remain as everYour affectionate brotherGeorge Teasdale. 
 the Liverpool, and B. S. Hunt to the Nottingham Conferences. The brethren have all left for their various fields of labor, after a pleasant visit in Liverpool and to their friends.I have returned from seeing the Scandinavian Company off. This is our second company of the season. There are 144 emigrants and 8 returning missionaries, also an English family of 4 persons making in all 156 souls. This company is in charge of Elder Adolph Anderson with L. Ernstrom & G. S. Bastian as his first and second counsellors. Ole Petersen, of Brigham City N. C. Lund, of Ogden, Niels Anthon, of Spanish Fork, L. P. Niel-sen, of Montpelier, & A. G. Erickson of Sale Lake City. We tele-graphed you to day "156 sailed 81 full 32 half send Tenbroeck 4300." There are 148 souls without the missionaries, 74 adults, 32 half fare, 35 between 1 and 5 years, and 7 infants. = 148 and 8 missionaries = 156. Brother Anderson has his wife and children along. His wife was only booked to New York to see if she could get a pass over the line. Mr Ramsden made Bro. Anderson & family exceedingly comfortable. The Elders all had a cabin passage and were exceeding well pleased. Your much appreciated favor of the 12th ult. came safe to hand and we have deemed it wisdom to publish most of it in the "Star"; so that all the Elders may know your mind concerning them. I am grate-ful to be able to report we are all well at 42 and doing as well as we can under the circumstances.With kind love Your brother George TeasdaleThe Guion S. S. Wyoming is the name of the vessel that left to-day. The strike caused a stop in the sailings which made a change 
 done and we shall reap the fruits if we faintnot. I regret to have to report Elders A. Mawand Dalrymple of the Newcastle Conferenceso indisposed as to warrant their returnhome with the June Company of the 28thif not before. It seems as if there wasa warfare against the good earnest work-ing Elders. You can tell that by the num-ber who return through sickness. PresidentStucki is with us. He came with this Com-pany of Saints. They were well treatedall along the journey. Mr. Ramsdenexercises his influence in our behalfall along the route and our emigrantsreceive very kind treatment. I hope weshall soon have some good mission-aries to help out so many going home.Good missionaries are in demand every-where, who can preach the gospel.We are all well at 42; justgot through house cleaning. We had avisit from the sanitary officers who arevery strict in regard to cleanliness anddoing everything to preserve the health ofthe people. All here join in kind loveand pray for you morning and eveningat our family alter; patiently waiting forthe redemption of Zion, and laboring quietlyon for the recompence of reward.

 Willd. WoodruffMinutes of a conferenceheld in Preston, LancashireEngland, April 15, 1840 
 New York, Sept. 14th [18]56.Elder Woodruff,Dear Bro: On account of my absence from Washington I only received your letter of the 31st  July at thisplace the day before yesterday. I am exceedingly thankfulfor the general information your letters contain and am indeed grate--ful for the better prospects of harvest announced in your last.I have remained here for the last month expressly to get ElderTaylor to complete his account of the Murder of the Prophet.He is so buisy that it has been with difficulty that he hasbeen able to bring his mind to the task and remain at it. I am, however, extremely satisfied with the prospectsof accomplishing the work. He thinks Dan Jones' statementof the dreams ought to be considerableed reliable. Frommany conversations I have had with Bro. Markhamin relation to the subject I have formed the opinion that hismemory is so treacherous that he would unwittingly mixother circumstances with those attending Joseph's ass-assination. His statements would therefore require criticismElder Taylor is bothered for dates of days & hours.Since I wrote you I have visited  your native Statean account of which the boys will find in the Mormon.I am greatly obliged to Bro. Bullock & the clerks in the officefor keeping me posted on the affairs at home and thank youkindly for the attention to my fruit trees.I expect to go to St. Louis just as soon as ElderTaylor finishes his narrative of the conversation betweenthe Governor & the Prophet, &ce.I preached last Sunday here and according tothe announcement of the brethren in to-day's Herald Iam to lecture this evening on "Utah and the presentposition of the Mormons."Heywood has returned to Washington and has betterprospects of winding up his business affairs and hopes to 
 return to Utah this season yet. Appleby is attendinga "Wood's Meeting" to-day in New Jersey. Elder Tayloris at this moment going a head with the Governor'sconversationThe political atmosphere is as usual cloudyand betokens storms. The spirit of dis-unionis rampant and "Bleeding Kansas" is the principalcapital for the Republican party: and a battlehas to be fought every week to keep up the exite-ment.Neither Elder Taylor or myself has receivedany letters from our families by the August mailI think you will find Elr. Taylor's accountof Governor Ford's conversation with Joseph asplendid affair.Please give my kindest regards to theclerks in the office I hope that by this time theyhave something better and more substantial thanbarley-meal.  Perhaps you would say a word or two of my family in your communicationsso that if I fail to obtain their letters I may learnsomething of their whereabouts.With best affection for self & familyI am, Yours faithfully,Geo. A. Smith.[sideways text]George A SmithNew York Sept 14thAnswd April 1th 1857[end of sideways text]
