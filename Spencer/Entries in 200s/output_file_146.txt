 because: better able to stand the climate, the poor food, long walks, sometimes poor beds, and sometimes no beds. Elder Reid of Ogden informs me he is 67 years of age and he finds it impossible for him to put up with the hardship incident to missionary life. his spirit is willing but his flesh is weak. Elders Geo Goddard and Edward Stevenson are making an ernest effort in Leicester their old home they have hopes of accomplishing some good altho their first meetings they regarded as almost failures so far as attendance was concerned. We are continuing our outdoor preaching when the wheather permits, it having been quite rainy for two weeks past. has interifered with us some. The prospect of crops at present is moderately good. Farmers are harvesting. In the some of the Manufacturing districts business is very dull quite a number of our people are out of employment in various places. I trust that arrangements may be made with the Church property that [Him] and his thieving gang wont get their hands upon it even if Congress should at some future time pass to vote a bill as the one which fails to go through. Give my kind regards to the brethren in the Office with you and any other of the brethren you may meet my wife thought it best to go home and I felt it was right. May the Lord bless and prosper you and lengthen out your days that your testimony may be heard in Israel until you are sattisfied with life your Brother in the Gospel John Henry Smith

 St. Joseph, Dec. 5th 1888  Pres. W. Woodruff, S. L. City.  Dear Brother:  Your answer to the Sunset Committee's Report was rec'd in due time a  coppy of which was sent to the members. The means have been all divided, and the  committee will send all the books and papers to you by Team the first safe opportunity as there are rather much to send by mail.  Hoping yourself and your Brethren with you are well I remain your Brother in Christ,  John Bushman 
 -[Updated letter, but written sometime in December 1888, perhaps Dec. 5.]-  President W. Woodruff and the Apostles:  I desire to inform you of our condition in this ward; last week dureing  the heavy Rains we had the largest freshet we have had (sinece 1878) which took out  about half of our Dam., and as there are only 15 families liveing here they feel  some what Discouraged, and feel it a heavy labor to put the Dam in without any  asistance, and should any more leave it would be still harder for us to maintain  our location here. The present Dam was put in with Piles about 4 years ago and  has stood the freshets very well, we repaired it last summer and it appeared  quite safe, our People began to think we had the Dam Perminant and have some  pretty good substantial homes and farms, our lands seems to yeald very well when  it is properly tilled, I am confident if we had as many more settlers we could  establish a very good place here, and sustain our selves very well, as we have  had plenty water the driest seasons and there is plenty land to take up by Home- stead or Premption, the most of the land we farm is held by Homesteads, the  Health of the People is excelent and a good spirit Prevails, ever Praying for the  Prosperity of Zion I am your Brother,  John Bushman, Bp. 
 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona, Nov. 24, 1879.  Dear Brother Tenney;  I received your communication on Saturday night at the Springs 40 miles  west of here. I arose early in the morning and came to Sunset at night and have  counseling with Pres. Lot Smith concerning your purchase with Mr. Barth and our  united voice is for you to accept his proposals But we would like to know what  that 2 1/2 acres is reserved for and by whom. Cannot that be included in the pur- chase? And again does the purchase include all the water right of the creek or  does the west side hold claims to a part of the waters of the creek? Brother  Smith and myself both would rather you would buy out all the water right of the  town if you can. If the people hold the right on the west side of the creek  will they not claim the surplus water and play the Stinson game on us and still  occupy the west side and let their cattle run over our crops. We would like to  understand, as far as we can, cooncerning all these matters. We would rather buy  out the place if we could so as to make a Mormon town of it, and not be mixed  with Jews, Mexicans and Gentiles.  I am satisfied that Barth is a sharper and will get all he can and you will  have to be careful and in making the purchase with him do not let him have a  loop hole to crawl out, and if you can get the 2 1/2 acres you had better get it.  I know he is a slippery man but if anybody can trade with him I know you can.  I wish You would send me a letter by the bearer and answer the foregoing questions.  If your purchases will take all the water of the creek, if not what portion?  Will there be any water claim on the west, if so how much? Does Barth own the  2 1/2 acres and what does he want to keep it for? Will he ^not^ have a hold on a part of  the water to make us trouble? We would like information upon all these points.  Will there be surplus water for him or anybody else to claim to make us trouble?  We would like you to buy all the water rights of the place if possible. We  think we can back you up so as to make the purchase. Is sSt. Johns surveyed by  the U. S. surveyors? You say the 2 1/2 acres is on the edge of town on the east  side of the creek. I thought the village was on the west side of the river. Does  your purchase include the dwellings or any of them? We would like an explanation  of all these things. Brother Smith is anxious to have you buy out of the whole town  if you could, if not get all the water rights you can.  Of course you will not have a chance to consult with us about anything  after you get this until you get your purchase made, but do the best you can  and whatever bargain you make bind it with a band of iron so strong that no one can break it. Write by the bearer all you can about it and as soon as you  get the bargain send me word by mail.  I shall write to Brother Taylor immediately and tell him to have mis- sionaries who are coming to take possession of the place to bring cows with  them of the age you speak of. Do not fail to make the purchase if possible. I  Tthink that is all I need to say upon the subject. With regard to occupying  the Colorado Meadows, there should be means taken immediately to occupy the  place by the brethren. We are now making arrangements to fit up teams and  send 2 from Sunset, 2 from Bringham City and will call for 1 from St. Joseph  and 4 perhaps from Snowflake and will send what we can to you to take up the  Meadow forth with, but we shall want you to go with them to go with them to Greers and help  them settle or locate and Gilbert Greer might make a claim and I want these  brethren to locate their claims so as to exclude the St. Johns folks from  getting a hold there. 
 We will start them off forthwith and send them to you. I want all these  things kept as secret as possible until we get the place secured. We have  concluded to start 4 men tomorrow morning to St. Joseph and from there to  Brother Greers and Brother Brookbank will take the letter to you from St.  Joseph. You will find him a No. 1 man and I want him to be with you in the  mission, I know you can work together like a charm and I now want to say to  you once for all this is the voice of all our Council and if you want any more, I wilol say it is the Will of the Lord that Ammon M. Tenney preside over this  mission. Therefore make no more excuse but round up your shoulders and receive  this mission and appointment and God will bless you and make you an instrument  in his hands of bringing many of the House of Israel into the Church and Kingdom  of God, who will be saved through your instrumentality. Therefore, go to, unite with your brethren and lead out in this work and open your mouth, preach the Gos- pel to the Lamanites or Nephites as you find them and prophecy unto them as you  shall be led by the power of God and the Lord will stand by you and you will be  able to accompllish all that your heart desires in righteousness.  As Brother Brookbank will not return, but will stop with you, therefore  send your communications to me by mail, unless there is a private conveyance  open. I want the Meadows taken possession of about the same time you buy St.  Johns or a little before so that they cannot get possession. Now if you make  any change in your purchase of St. Johns notify me immediately as I may want  to write to President Taylor.  Concerning your going to St. Johns with your family; if you purchase  perhaps you had better go there and take possession of it. But I want you to  go with the Brethren to Brother Greer's and scatter them through the Meadow  and take up all the desirable places as fast as the brethren come. I do not  intend to let daylight, dark night or grass grow under my feet to stop me  trying to do my duty or helping to settle Arizona or  New Mexico or bringing  the House of Israel into the Kingdom of God not if I know it.  I would like you to instruct the missionaries in Spanish eor council them  to improve their time in it what you can. I have thought of asking you what  you would think trying to buy out that Mexican at the Spring where we got a  drink of water as we came into Meadow. It might do no harm to try. I do not  think of anything more at this time.  My love and blessings to your wives, children, mother, brother and friends.  Yours Brother in the Gospel Lewis Allen. (Wilford Woodruff)  PRIVATE: I am going to write to Brother Greer to assist the brethren to locate  the Meadow. Now I do not know how much of the Spirit of Zion he has got. His son  Gilbert has the Spirit of his mission. I think if he has and can locate a claim  with the rest it might be well for them to do it. I would like you to see how  Brother Greer is and if he feels like it I would like him to help what he can in it.  I have given Brother Gilbert Greer a notification of his appointment as a  missionary to the Lamanites under your direction. I would like him to take hold  immediately with you and perhaps he can assist you in your temporal affairs.  Some of these missionaries who will go to the Meadows who to make claims as far  as they can I want them to enter upon their missions as soon as convenient. 
 I do not wish to make any presidency in this mission separate from the  presiding officers of these Stakes, so while I am in the country I will give  you ^what^ council I can, but you may consider yourself under the Presidency of Jesse  N. and Lot Smith, but while any of the twelve are in the country it is their  province to give counsel upon all these matters as far as they have an oppor- tunity.  I am soon expecting Brigham Young and several others from the north,  before long and we may call and visit you.  L. A.

Dear Brother:  This will in- troduce to you Brother Thomas R. Galbraith  from Sligo Ireland, who is a Priest in the  Liverpool Branch and who is desirous to  make himself useful in assisting in the  building up of the kingdom of God on the  earth in any manner that his time or  talents can be made available. As he is  comparatively a stranger I have taken the  liberty to introduce him unto you in the  hope there may be a vacancy in some  of the Latter-day Saint schools where his  talent might be available as he has been  very successful amongst children and  takes much pleasure in that profession  and believes that Theology should be one  of the principle subjects in education as the  fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Trusting you will pardon the liberty I have  taken and kindly consider the interest I have in  the young & rising generation, I remain  Your brother in the gospel George Teasdale

President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City U. T.  Dear Brother:  A company of Saints from Scandinavia leave Liverpool to-day in charge of Elder J. C. A. Weibye of Manti. with Elder Mads Jorgensen, of Provo, and Andrew Knudsen, of Provo, as his 1st and 2nd Counsellors Elder J. P. Toolsen, of Smithfield, as clerk & recorder. The other elders  returning are Andrus Mortensen, of West Porterville, Jas. Anderson, of Spanish Fork, Ole Petersen, of Bennington, Hans Sarrensen, of Orderville, Ola Jonson of Logan (who has added Nordberg to his name) Jas. Thompson of Brig- ham City, Hans Larson, of Kamas, Ole Olesen of Lewis- ton, O. J. Johnson, of Plain City, and Oluf Jensen of Brigham City. H. P. Jensen, of Provo. The company without counting the returning missionaries num- ber 176 souls 93 adults and 83 children (There is one amongst them who was baptized when eight years old he says who has been sent for by his twin brother who is likely to be sent back his appearance is so much against him ragged and rough. It is much to be regretted this kind of people are sent for, surely we have enough of the vagobond element amongst us. The saints have objected to his company so we have had 
 to berth him with the gentiles. We cannot be responsible for this class. His name is Adolph Peter Hansen aged 21, Booked for Salt Lake City. All this I learn by representation which should be reliable. It has pleased our heavenly Father to draw into His fold a young man who is the son of a clergyman of the established Church of England. He has been an earnest worker in education and in faith relying upon God to provide the necessary means, for the inde gent. His name is Thomas Richard Galbraith. He has been in the office a good deal and I have taken to him as an honest man. He is going to work his passage to New York hav- ing obtained a situation on the S. S. Wyoming He is a sailor having been apprenticed to the sea and travelled a good deal. He entered as a sailor but the captain has placed him amongst the stewards. He was going to work until he obtained sufficient means to go to Utah but I have advanced him the money feeling that his labors will be more valua ble to us amongst the rising generation. He appears to be a gentleman, humble, prayerful and willing. Has quite a good faith and trust in God and improves upon acquaintance although he has quite the ministerial expression that he has been trained in which will ^doubtless^ give way before the 
 natural education he will obtain through association in the Kingdom of God. I should have used him here in the work of the min istry, and he was quite willing, but I have reflected that it would be better for him to get a home in Zion and better educated in true principle, with some experience in the gospel to better qualify him for that labor. I have given him a letter of intro- duction to yourself so you may see him and if you think proper for him to engage in school keeping in the Latter- day Saints schools that he can do so. I  have also given him a letter of introduc- tion to Bro. James Jack who could intro- duce him to yourself when convenient. This has been entirely my own arrange ment Bro. Galbraith never asked such a thing. He said if he could reach Utah he was satisfied he could make his  living and was going trusting in the Lord, and this is what the Lord has done for him, for my natural suspicious nature would have prompted me to take no such course. I tell him he need not thank me for this but Him who has so wrought upon me to take this step. 
 The future will unfold whether I have been led right or not. So far as I am concerned I am willing to risk it for my impressions are he will prove true blue. I regret to inform you that Bro Payne from Filmore now laboring in London will have to re- turn through delicate health. With regard to Bro. Jas. Leaing he is the best missionary we have in the field. He is doing an excellent work in London presiding over that Conference and if it would be agreeable to all we should be pleased to keep him until next spring but if it is necessary he should return, why he will leave in October. Bro. Payne is a worker, he is a first class missionary, and has done a good work. Bro. Wm Kelson  will have to return through ill health He is hardly capable for the hardships  of missionary life in the British Isles. I am happy to say we are all reasonably well at 42 and join in kind love to yourself Counsellors and brethren with you. Hoping and praying for the re- demption of Zion I remain as ever:  Yours very affectionately in the Gospel George Teasdale

President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  President J. U. Stucki  of the Swiss and German Mission has been down  with the small pox which he contracted in Bohemia  at the house of Bro. Dittrich. He was travelling through  the mission and taken sick while in Stuttgart with a  heavy fever and chills, pains in his back and head  which kept increasing on him until he broke out. He  thought he had caught a severe cold and kept moving  about filling his appointments being all the time exposed  to heat causing sweatings and then to chilly winds,  and made the trip from Basel to Bern in a  draughty railway car. He mentioned these facts  to show how miraculously he was healed by the  power of God being so exposed to heat & cold. When  he reached Bern Bro Brandley felt determined  to wait on Pres Stucki and nurse him, as he had no  fear. The Brethren administered to him and in less  than two weeks he was up again comparatively well, only weak. No one took the disease and no  one in the house outside of our own folks knew  that anyone had the disease. Bro. Stucki has hardly  any marks from the effects of the disease. He  has surely been very much blessed of our heavenly Father. 
 Bro Stucki reports that while he was in Reichenberg  he sent for Bro. L. M. Cannon in Saxony as he thought  it would be a good plan for Bro Dittritch to have some  help, but through a couple of traitors in the Church  a strong persecution arose. Bro. Dittritch was arrest ed for committing the crime of teaching an unauthor- ized religion, baptizing &c and the prospect was  he would get perhaps a year and a half imprison- ment so he concluded to give them the slip and  he was then in Bern. Four of his children had been  sick with the small pox, one of them had died and  his wife had been sick. His family is in a very  pitiable condition alone amongst traitors and  enemies, only a few Saints to sympathise and  they too poor to render any assistance. Bro Cannon  barlely escaped arrest. I think I have stated before  that the Swiss and German Mission will require  some more missionaries to relieve those who  are going home in the fall. They will want at  least seven good missionaries for the fall indeed  the field is amply large for many more elders. Prest Stucki is an excellent missionary. He says "The Elders feel well everywhere and they are blessed  in their labors more especially in South Germany  Four ^persons^ have been baptized in Saxony who seem to be  earnest and faithful. I am somewhat troubled about  the Turkish Mission. I receive letters from Bros Hintzie, J. M. Sjodabl, W. H. Smart and Locander  With the exception of Bro. Hintzie and J. M. Sjodabl 
 II  they do not seem to have much faith in the  Turkish Mission or in Bro Hintze. They say  he tells the people too much from pre-existence to  Adam being the God of this earth and that God is  only man perfected. The principle topic is a coloni- zation scheme, means for printing, and  house rent  and "backshish" which I am informed "is absolutely  necessary." Bro Hintze says "I cannot say what  we may need in means because it is all so  uncertain where a government is to be bought  with money. Then I do not know what to apply  for without knowing what our brethren will  sustain. Excuse me for a suggestion. As the  whole matter now stands, and as it is of  great importance would it not be better  that you and the Presidency at home see me  face to face so as to make proper arrangements as to our efforts here? It would save me ans time and anxiety." The above subjects of those  wants of the mission and schemes for getting the gospel before. the people, all requiring means are what the letters I receive are composed of. Bro. Clove is returning sick. Just about the time he has some smattering of the lan- guage enough to converse he is obliged to return. I watched to see binic until I wrote to  you but concluded to write for the prospect of acertaining how far I am at liberty to go 
 in the using of means for instead of one  establishment there are three expecting to  draw on this office. One in Constantinople one in Aintab and one in Palestine. With  the exception of Bro. Sjodabl the brethren  do not seem, to have much faith in the  Turkish Mission only to kill time. They  have got the experience of Elder Clove  and have seen how he has passed his  time and of the labors of Elder Hintze  and his experience, seen the class of  converts who have professed to become  converted and got acquainted with the  opposition of all around them and the  absence of any interest manifested that  they do not write very encouraging let- ters. If you have noticed any commanica- tions from the elders in that mission it has  been about the manners and customs of  the people as they view it. Letters that seem  to have been written for a consideration to  help them to a little means in their needy  condition. But so far as missionary labors  are concerned they do not seem to have  much to write about. I would be pleased  to hear from you how far you will be willing I should supply this mission with means beecause  they have drawn upon us to consume all the  three hundred dollars appropriated. I wrote to  Prest Hintze asking about how much he thought it  would need for publishing some tracts &c and 
 III  telling him that I did not think we wanted  to buy the government for the sake of the  privilege to preach the gospel, that called  for the remarks I have quoted from his  letter. Some time ago the brethren got some  printing done in germany and all the tracts  were confiscated. In No 34 Star we have publish- ed a letter from Prest Hintze. I think some policy  should be defined with regard to this Mis- sion. Prest H. writes Our house rent  5.0.9 is again  due and I have no M. funds only to rely upon your  assistance until all affiers matters are settled I extract a portion of his letter for your consideration Turkey is a long way from home. It takes over  $20000 perhaps $250 00/100 to reach here. Most elders are  stripped when they arrive (I was even without  the necessary means to reach Constantinople and may as well state right here that I have  no present resources to raise funds. I am therefore  forced to look for assistance to me a continual  regret) There for the elders to go into the interior  and live takes another good round sum Hence  the fact is we arrive poor, and we nearly all need  assistance from home in some way, and that  assistance is not forth coming. Therefore we have had to ask your assistance. For instance my Bp. was especially instructed by Apostles F. D. Richards 
 and John H. Smith to assist me and when I wrote  to him about the twenty pounds I personally bor- rowed of your office he did not even answer; He  is not a bad man but I understand my case is  among the common ones." Well I think I have  said enough about the Turkish Mission. If it  was now a question of dollars and dimes I  should hesitate to bother you with so long  a letter. The ani-mormons have been breathing  out threatnings and this office is watched. We are all well in health and spirits at present. Bro. Brookband has been quite  unwell but is better. We keep sending Bro John L. papers when there is anything of  interest. Bro. C. D. Fjeldsted writing from  Copenhagen Aug 12, says "There is quite an  opposition started in the Aalborg Conference all the Utah brethren except two having  been called before the police authorities and one already received his sentence of  banishment. Will inform you further as  soon as we learn particulars." The elders  had been successful in baptizing a member  and it aroused the priests so the brethren said. With kindest regards to yourself, Counsellors  and all with you, I remain as ever  Your brother in the covet Geo Teasdale

President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  On Wednesday the 4th inst we were visited by the following brethren and sister who arrived in Liverpool from New York per Guion S. S. Nevada. There were three appointed to the Netherlands. Jos. H. Lambert, Albert Spencer and Louis W. Simmons. Eight were appointed to the British Isles and were located in the following Conferen- ces Samuel W. Western and John E. Huish, to the Bir- mingham; George Marshall and Robert H. Hodge to the Manchester; John H. Clark and Edwin John Longhurst, to the London; Charles England to the Norwich Conferences and John T. Evans to Wales. Bro. John B. Milner and his wife on a visit to relatives and business. They were all in good health and spirits. We held a council meet- ing in the morning with the missionaries and they were appointed to their fields of labor. They met with us at our evening meeting in Bittern St, and bore their testimonies and expressed their wil- lingness to do their best to fill a good mission. (Prest Jos. Leaing, of the London Conference, who was with us at our morning council, gave the brethren some most excellent counsel on missionary labors. 
 Bro. Joseph Leaing has expressed himself as every Latter-day Saint, or servant of God feels. He wishes to be where the Lord wants him. In your communication to me, of July 23rd, you say "We think it quite proper for you to release Br. Jos Leaing so that he may return home if he so desires " Now he has never expressed that desire. He is one of the Lords Own, a minute man, a bright live miss- ionary and waits patiently to be released when he shall receive that word. He has been here three years next month, having arrived here on October 13, 1886 and is willing to stay as long as he is required. He enjoys the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, and consequently knows that the work we are engaged in is of God, and guided by the Spirit of revelation, according to the order of the Priesthood that He had appointed to the responsibility of presidency and the directing of the labors of their fellowservants under His direction, or revealed will, and so he says "when the Lord manifests His will for me to return I shall be pleased to do so, but until then I am perfectly willing to la- bor wherever I may be appointed." As I un- derstand it, my beloved president, this is the true feeling of every disciple of Jesus Christ. It is, "Father not my will but thine be done." It is the glory of God to have such humble faithful soul who love to serve Him and 
 keep His commandments, because they want to. Now I would be pleased to have your mind on this question Shall Bro. Leaing stay until the Spring or go him this fall? I ask this question to satisfy my own mind as much as any- thing else. I will write more freely next time after I have received your answer. I have received a letter from Bro. Job Pingree in which he says he has had an interview with yourself & counsel and some members of the Twelve "in my behalf" I am at a loss to remember whatever I could have said to him to call forth such an expression. Bro Pingree spent a few days with us and we much enjoyed his excellent spirit. We talked to- gether very freely about the mission and the spirit of the gentiles. He had quite an experience visiting his friends and acquaintances. He was with me in the prayer room and I read him some letters from the elders, all testifying to the spirit of indifference in some places and mobocra- tic feeling in others so that he got quite an insight into the condition of the mission and I remember telling him that if he saw any of the authorities at home he would be well posted to give them a pretty good report 
 much better then I could do through the me- dium of a sheet of paper; and when he left all I remember saying was give my kind love to the Presidency, or any of the Twelve you may see and tell them we are patiently rowing against the stream. We have been sounding the gospel trumpet by preaching and destributing tracts and consequently have stirred up the people, unprincipled men finding Jarman are making a good living by traduscing the "mormons" have adopted a similiar mode of obtaining a living and selling Jarmans books of course all this inflames the people against us. You know how ready they are to believe anything against us. But we are busy doing all we can to seek out the House of Israel and trying by the grace of God to do our duty and tell the people what the Book of Mormon is and supply them at a cheap rate.  In all our heavenly Father has blessed us and en- couraged as in our labors and duties.  It is His work and we are only poor representa- tives of His cause, but we love to serve Him and labor in our poor way looking to Him for the increase, and grace ourselves to over come and endure unto the end in His Church & Kingdom. So far as we are concerned we are not discouraged. If the people do not want the gospel it is their 
 loss not ours. If they prefer the testimony of an escaped lunatic going through the land with a lying spirit traducing Gods people, why we cannot help it. Our Elders have been testifying to the restoration of the gospel and the authority of God, with the priesthood, to administer in the ordinances of His House, and offering them the Pearl of Great Price Eternal Lives and they despise them and their testimony, so it is not to be wondered at, they should crowd together to listen to and believe a lie, that they may be damned who have pleasure in unrightiousness and be- lieve not the truth. I do not know that we should condemn these people so much when we see the course being pursued in the gathering place of the saints amongst those who have been converted and blessed of the Lord, and their children who have been raised in the midst of light and truth. From all we hear through the press and from private sources, if there are not those in Zion ripening for the burn- ing as well as those on the outside world, why then we will gladly confess ourselves 
 mistaken. President Woodruff, the elders in Israel, at home or abroad, who are serving God and keeping His commandments are not discouraged. They understand the signs of the times and know that but few men will be left. The propecies do not point to the Church of the Lamb being so very numerous; they know it is a strait and narrow way that leads to life everlasting, and are more interested in making their own calling and election sure then getting discouraged because of the folly or in- difference of others. Do not think we are discouraged or weary of serving God, for it is not so. We simply trust in God and seek His counsels day and night. We want His will to be done, we want His Kingdom, not only for ourselves, but for the benefit of our posterity of unborn generations. We want the government of God and the rule of His Priesthood of righteousness for we have all faith that where the meek and pure in heart rule we will have a reign of righteous- ness. With kindest love and blessing to your- self, counsellors, and brethren of the Apostles, I remain as ever  Your unworthy brother in Christ George Teasdale  P.S.

 North Lat. 44, Long 69, 10. North Fox Islands, Vinalhaven, Maine, Sept. 15, 1837  Aphek & Azubah Woodruff, Honoured Parents As duty And the commandments of God hath called your Son to stand upon the Islands of the sea in defence of the word of God, & the testi- mony of Jesus Christ, I am under the necessity of making use of my pen to communicate all information that you recieve from me, but this is a privilege inasmuch as we can not do it by word of mouth. I would inform you that I recieved a letter from my wife yesterday informing me that she took two letters out of the Office for me, one from you, & the other  from Brother Asahel. She gave me the purport of them. I was  glad to hear from you, & all the friends & esspecially that the word had the desired affect in Aunt Cossetts family, & with others. I would like to be with you & our friends in Connecticut long enough to build up a Church, but if I cannot be, I pray God to send some faithful servent among you to teach the word. I expect you wish to hear where I am, & what I am doing &c. On the 19th of Aug, in company with Elder Hale, I left Portland on board the steamboat Bangor, foxr fox Islands, Vinalhaven. After travling 100 miles on the steam boat; we took a vessel & was landed on North fox Island at 2 oclok  Sunday morning following, entire strangers & about peneyless. We called at the first house & retired to rest, as we had slept none through the day & night. We arose at 8 oclock took breakfast. I then enquire if their was any priest or religion on the Island. they informed us theirre was a Baptist meeting house & church & priest in the centre of the Island, & that there would be preaching to day. In the name of the Lord we hastened to the place. Meeting had commenced. I sent for the deacon to come to the door; I told him we were servents of God, we had a message to the people & wished to be herd. he informed the priest of it. he invited us into the pulpet. After he closed they had a short intermission I then arose & addressed the congregation, and it was amid many peculiar feelings; knowing that it was the first time the voice of an Elder ^of^ the Latter Day Saints, was herd upon one of the Islands of the sea, to set forth the fullness of the gospel. When I closed I gave out several appointments for preaching in different parts of the Island, which was 9 miles long & 2 miles wide containing 800 inhabitants divided into four distrects having four school houses. We presented Mr Newton (this Baptist priest) the Book of Mormon he was mild, did not object to it, said he would read it. In the first fourteen days, we preached nineteen discourses, & the whole Island flocked out to hear. The priest began to see his foundation giving way, he was alarmed & began to cry against us & would not let us have the meeting house. But the excitement ^was^ so great & the people so much in our favor that on Sunday the 27th the people asseb assembled at a school house to hear us 
 While Mr. Newton had the meeting house to himself without one solitary soul to accompany him. Even the deacons of the church were attending our meetings & enquiring into these things & & calling upon us to visit them, & the sound went abroad to other Islands of the sea with rapidity, & they came over in their ships & boats to hear for themselves. On Sunday the 3rd Sept. I preached to a Large congregation assembled together from different Islands after I closed a very wealthy, respectable Sea Captain & his Lady came foreward & wished to be baptised. We repaired to the waters of the Atlantic & Elder Hale lead them down into the sea & baptized them. These are the first baptized upon the Islands of the sea (to my knowledge) by the Elders of Israel, & they are the first fruits of our min- istry here. & On last Sunday the 10 th of the month, I met a large congregation at the same place from different Islesands, & & preached to them from Math 16 ch 17, 18, & when I closed another sea captain a member of the Baptist church came forward for baptism & also a  young Lady. We repaired to the sea shore, & while the people throng'd the beach I lead them forth into the ocean & baptized them both for the remission of their sins & lade hands upon them & they received the Holy ghost & were made glad. On the Tuesday following three others wished to be baptized & the ordinance was administered unto them by Elder Hale which makes seven we have baptized. Thus you seae the Lord hath not sent us here in vain. There is many on our right & left ready as it were to step into the waters of Baptism. Calls begin to salute us from the different Islands come & preach to us, come & preach to us. We have visited South Fox Island & held five meet- ings with them, they came out by hundreds & filled the homes. South Fox Island is 10 miles  long & 5 wide containing 1000 inhabitants with 6 school houses no meeting house but a methodist church, & a priest in their midst. They have 3 saw mills & one grist mill these are all tide mills vinal haven fits out rising of 100 vessels for fishing & mostly from this Island.  The inhabitants of Vinalhaven are wealthy, healthy, industrious, intelligent, generous & very hospitable to strangers notwithstanding they are mostly fishermen. pop 1,800. Vinalhaven includes both of fox Islands. North Island is rather rocky & rough have some fine farms, rase good wheat, barley, & potatoes, which is the staple pro- ductions, but little stock excepting sheep which are numerous. they have but just finished haying and are now in the midst of wheat harvest. There is an aboundance of raspburies and gooseburies on these Islands, but are now mostly gone. not much of any other fruit. The timber is spruice, fir, & hemlock. Their is one Post Office & store on this Island. one tide grist mill, &c.  South Fox Island is as near without any form or void I think as any think I ever saw. It is almost impossible for the best historian to give an exact description of it. it is a universal mass of ledges & shelves of rocks formed into hills & valleys cut up into necks & points to make room for the coves and harbours that run through & through this Island. One may form some faint idea of it, on learning that it is supposed to be rising of 100 miles round the Island to follow the beach in all its crooks & angles. There is some small parts of this Island under cultivation but it is at the expens of great labour & toil. The hills are timbered with pitch pine and  spruce, the timber & bushes principly grow out of the cracks of the rocks, while the valleys are timbered in the same manner with fir & birch. this people procured their wealth & living wholey by fishing, perhaps their is no people that supply greater quantities of fish than they of this Island. many of them fish at Newfoundland & prepare them for sale here. their is many kinds of fish here around these Island such as Whale, Blackfish, shark, ground shark, Pilot fish, Hors mackerel, stergeon, Holloboat, Salmon, Cod, Pollock, Hake, Haddock, Shad, Mackerel Tom cod, Bass, Alewives Herren, Pohagen, Dolphin Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Scate, Shrimp, Skid, Cusk, Bluebacks, Dogfish, Muttonfish, Lump fish, Squid, Five fingers, Munkfish, Nurs fish, Sunfish, Sword fish, Tharsher, catfish, whiting, scuppog, Tootog, Eyefish, Minney's, cunner, Ling, Eels,  Lobsters, clames, scollops, Mussels, Wrinkles, seal, & Porposes &c &c. & many others not named. I have stood on the shore & seen large schools of Mackerel come up to us so that we could catch any quantity of them with hooks that we wished, also the beach is supplyed with clames in almost any part of the Island. The adjoining Islands are more fertile than these. In a clear day I can view with the naked eye about fifty Island of the sea many of which are inhabited, & sometimes 20 or 30 gallant ships are passing by us at once &c. I have not givien this brief history of these Islands because my mind is more 
 on these things than my calling, for it is not. consequently I wish to call your minds back again to my labour in the vineyard  I remarked that many came out to hear us on the South Island. The methodist priest became alarmed for fear his foundation also was in danger, & he came over whare we were baptizing & made friends with the Baptist priest, (like Herod & Pilate) and called a meeting I went out to hear him. [##Luke 23:12##] He commenced warm hostilities against the Book of Mormon and our principles I wrote down his discours & are to give answer to it next Sunday, at which time I expect to meet a numerous assembly I learned he would not be present to hear my answer so I arose & rectifyed some of his wild mistakes in his presensce before he left the congregation. The Baptist priest has written Letters & even gone himself to the main land after several priests to come over and help them, declairing if they do not come the churches here will surely fall. -[But cursed is man that puteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord]- But O ye priests of Baal your cry is in vaine. The God of Israel hath set his hand to recover Israel his people The stone has begun to roll. God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, and with them he will rend your Kingdoms. The cry of the Saints is assending unto the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth for Ephraim. The Apostles of the Lamb of God are bearing the Keys of his Kingdom on the shores of Europe. Yea & the mighty captains of these Islands are receeving the gospel of JESUS CHRIST & injoying its power. And the call of many from distant Islands has already entered into our Ears to come & preach to them. My own Book of Mormon has this day taken its departure over the billows of the great deep to teach those that trade in ships at sea, & the word & work is propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And every weapon formed against Zion shall soon be broken, & he that raises his puny arm against it, is fighting against God, & shall soon mourn because of his loss. I say these things are so as God [himself] & the Spirit beareth record & the record is here. Therefore O Babylon thy fall is sure.  My dear parents suffer me to drop a few words of my meditations on this paper. When I think where I am, what my calling is, & where I have been  & whare I shall be, & have to do in this generation, I marvel & wonder. I [page torn] myself. A few years since, I was tendindg mill as other men not expecting to do [page torn] to live & di[e] with my friends. But how changed the scene, the last four years has [page torn] the plow, called me into the ministry, bestowed the Holy priesthood, annointing, [page torn] Blessing upon my head, & called me into the ranks of [page torn] [s]eventy Apostles to pus [page torn] from the ends of the earth, and act a conspicuous part in winding up the august scene of these last days in rending the kingdoms of darkness, and error with everlasting truth. It has called me to visit 16 different states in America, & travel about 14,000 miles to preach the word of God, and are now standing upon the Islands of the Sea, & thousands seeking wisdom & instruction at my mouth, While at the same time its wise & learned complain Bitterly that I am sapping the foundations of their Holy religion, churches & kingdom, & the ships of the sea spread their canvas to bring captains & sailors to hear my voice. I say amid these truths I ask myself the question who am I. ^I^ am that poor, weak, ignorant, Illiterate Willford. then I have nothing to boast. No God forbid. It is not Willford that has done this, but it is the power & work of God. I'll acknowledge he hath chosen the weak things of this world to perform his work with, & if I glory it shall be in the cross of Christ  I cannot tell when I shall see any of you again. their was some invisidble power seemed to hurry me from connecticut to come on my journey, it has been so with me ever since I left Kirtland, untill I reached these Islands, and the reason was because of the great work to be done here, for the sound will go from here to a vast number of the Islands to prepare the way before us. But I rejoice that I had the privilege of visiting you at all. I now feel as though it will be my privilege to visit you again & build up a church in connecticut. But if I do not I pray GOD to send some one among you that will. I have great faith yet to believe that many of my blood relations & other friends will stand in the covenant before they die. yes I believe my  Parents & their family will, for I know they are of the Blood of Ephraim, and the Lord will never suffer the good my father hath  done to the poor in his ^day^ go unrewarded. I believe you will both live to see a change in this world which is fast hastning. it would be great joy to my soul to see you stand in the covenant. It is the work of God that hath called me to do as I have done, and it marvelous in mine eyes. I rather expect to spend next summer amid these Islands of the sea. I intend to visit Deer Island as soon as possible, it is but 12 miles to it. it contains 4000 inhabitants, and theirre is but one priest among them. I do not know whare I shall spend the winter, whether here or in Scarborough. My friends may still direct letters to Scarborough. Give my respects to Eunice, To Uncle Ozem & family & Aunt Cossetts family I think of writing to them both & also ^to^ Brother Asahel, & finally remember me to all inquiring fr^i^ends. O how I wish they would all receive the fullness of the gospel. Dear Parents Pray for me & watch the signs of the times. I want to see you all much but I'll be content whare God would have me. Elder Hale, & Phebe both wish to be remembered to you and all inquiring friends. That the peace of GOD may abide with you & that your lives health & strength may be prescious in HIS sight, is the prayer of your Dutiful son  Willford Woodruff

 Rochester Sangamon County Illinois Dec 19th 1838  [FIGURE] Eunice Woodruff  My Dear Sister  Although I am in the midst of a croud & but a few moments allotted me to write yet I feel it my Duty to appropriate these few moments in communicating a few words to you & my Dear parents. I thought it proper to direct this sheet to you in consequence of the writing on the 3rd page which is the production of Brother Asahels pen which I found among his papers which appears to be an address to you. Whether it is a copy of writings already in your possession or not I am unable to say. But as I feel anxious to put in your possession all writings that you have sent him or that he has directed to you is the cause of my writing upon the same sheet. As Death has closed all communications between Asahel & yourself & our parents I feel it my duty to give you all information that I possess concerning his sickness & Death or any thing concerning him that will be of interest to you. I also feel it my Duty to write to you as often as my circumstances will admit & I have matter of interest to comunicate. I have much upon my mind at this time I would like to communicate which I mus[t] omit for want of time but I will touch upon some importent items Firstly I hold in my hands a letter Dated Farmington Oct 31st 1838 from Aphek & Azubah & Eunice Woodruff to Mr James Dayson. in fine I have in my possession (I suppose) all the writings that were Directed to Asahel as well as his own compositions I took them because I supposed that I should be able to put them into the possession of my parents & Sister sooner than they  could obtain them any other way & I much doubt whether you would  ever obtained them had I left them in Terre Haute I shall give you information upon this subject from time to time as I write. I have not had time as yet to look over his writings but little & do not know what there is among them, but all of his corresponding letters with his Dear Sister & parents &  Azmon & myself & many other friends are among them there is many compo- sitions of his own of interest among them I was particular to enquire of his clerk & also Mr Smith concering his mind, his sickness, & death & I learn the following particulars that he was considered one of the first & most respect- able citizens of Terre Haute & his death much regretted  [upside-down text] Wilford Woodruff to Eunice Woodruff giving the Acco[un]t of the death of Ashael Woodruff [end of upside-down text] 
 his clerk said to never find a more [page torn] task than to part with him he said he never saw a [page torn] mind than his he also remarked that he was very absent minded for several months before his Death cheerful most of the time but occasionly lost in Deep meditation he spent muc^c^h of the time During his last months among his friends in public at ^times^ almost to the neglect of his business this was a secret they could not account for (But I could have told them that it was his mind upon spiritual subjects he was convinced of light & truth had none to unbosom his feelings unto & mingled with company to pass away his time & c.) [None] knew his mind upon religious subjects he was moral in all his conduct far from any thing leading to disruption he often spoke of his friend, & [doted] much upon a visit from me he remarked when he was taking sick that he feared he should not recover. he did not convers upon religious subjects after he was takingen sick & I do not wonder at it for there was no spirit in Terre Haute to receieve it I wonder how Asahels mind would have suffered him to have remained there as long as it Did. the Land was as [page torn] the garden of Eden but a wicked barren place spiritually. I wrote Asahel a Letter which he received just before his Death in which my mind was much exercised I never felt like bearing stronger testimony to any person than in that letter I little thought that it was my last testimony to him I write a letter to him afterwards but it did not arive untill after his death There was three Doctors attended upon Asahel During his sickness (which was 3 to many) I visited my Brothers grave I felt solumn while viewing it poor man he had not a relative to attend on his bed side or follow him to his grave I picked up some small stones from his grave in memory of him I was sorrow that in the sale of his papers that some articles of his clothing was not reserved but every thing of that nature was sold I have all of his [former] account Books his journals compositions, his watch two silver thimbles & pencils & penknife & c. you can make any enquiries of me by letter concerning those things that you wish as soon as I can inform you where to direct a letter I am sensible that Asahels Death will be deeply felt by you all he was a beloved Son & Brother truly may the Lord comfort you all under this affliction. My Dear Sister since Asahel is gone It has given me great consolation to meditate upon the cause. you have persued continue faithful in the cause in which you are engaged & you will receive a crown of Life! O that I can but meet my Sister in the celestial glory the thought of it will sweeten my tri[a]ls on Earth. Do not think that your Brother is Discouraged because of persecutions in the west. No God forbid it is true a number of our worthy brethren have sealed their testimony with their Blood of late, it is equally true that if it is the will of God your Brother is ready & willing to share the same fate. I tremble not at the approach of Death it has no terror to me I may be called to feel a Missourian's steel or lead for my religion if so & my work is Done I say amen, I am ready to meet it you may hear of my Death, but by the grace of God assisting me you shall not be pained with the intelligence that I have drawn back unto perdition I am travling through the cold of winter with a wife & child which is severe at this time but I endure these things patiently many of our Brethren are stoped at the Mississippi River beca[u]se of there faith I may be stoped myself but I shall travel untill I am give me your prayers Dear parents & Sister while Asahel sleeps in Death let me be consecrated to live or Die for Christ. O glorious strength, O Blessed hope. If we do not meet on Earth if we  are faithful we shall meet in heaven. phebe wishes to be remembered to you als[o] give our respects to all enquiring friends  Eunice Woodruff Your friend & Brother  Willford Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, April 21, 1880.  Ammon M. Tenney  Dear Brother:  I have tried to get time to write to you ever since I have reached Salt Lake City, but have never been in a situation to give you any information for the want of time and getting certain business done before the Council. Bro. Taylor got a letter from J. W. Y. -[John W. Young]- saying that you had more missionaries than was necessary at the Meadows to hold the claims so you was going to put some of them into the Missionary field. I was glad to learn this. If you have men to spare, the sooner the better. Bro. Young telegraphed that you, Christofferson and himself were at Albuquerque to buy goods for a Co-op Store, and he spoke about taking contracts on the Railroad for our people. If the brethren could unite together and take a contract so as to pay, I think it would be a good thing, so as to get their bread.  Now, concerning St. Johns. How is that a going? Bro. Hatch wrote me that somebody was sent as an Agent to borrow 100 cows to make the first payment of Bro. Flake. I was in hopes that the people who went there would be able to raise that first hundred cows. I wish you would write to me an[d] let me know how matters are at St. Johns, and what arrangements you have made for entering the land. I have got the privilege from Bro. Taylor and Council to use all tithing stock in the Territory to help pay for St. Johns, unless the brethren can occupy the land and pay for it.  This may be used as a loan and repaid when the people pay; I shall write to Lot and Jesse N. Smith and Richards of St. Joseph to unite with the tithing stock what they can, for we do not want that purchase to fail and I want you to  call upon Christofferson of Round Valley, Bp. Hunt and Jesse N. Smith of Snow- flake, Bp. Richards of St. Joseph and Lot Smith of Sunset, and Bp. Lake of Brigham City to gather the tithing stock, and you use it for the payment on that purchase as a loan, keeping a strict account of what tithing stock you use for the purpose. I shall write to them about it.  I wish you would write to me as soon as you get this, and tell me how  things are with you, and what you have paid on St. Johns, and what the prospect is. Tell me where the railroad is going and what the prospect is for our  brethren to take jobs on it, and what rate. Direct from W. Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah Box 321. I feel anxious to hear from you, and want to know what missionaries you have in the field and where, and any news I will be glad to  get.  My kind regards to Sister Tenney and all the brethren with you.  Your brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City May 25, 1880  Mr. A. M. Tenney, Dear Brother;  I received your two letters May 7 and 8, and ^they^ have been read to Bro. Taylor, and we are all pleased that things are as well as they are with you. A few items I wish to speak of. We sent word to the Priests and Bishops to assist in paying for the purchase of St. John in case of necessity, but as they can have no demand upon you until next November perhaps by that time there may be help enough to pay for the place without borrowing the Church stock, at least it might be well to let it rest until fall to see what position you will be in.  Concerning taking contracts on the railroad I think that would be well, but I think the Presidents of the Stakes should be consulted and a Committee appointed and some man chosen to make these contracts for the people who will do justice by the people and not pocket one half the people's earnings by their lax^b^or. Of course any man who takes these contracts on the railroad should be well paid for his labors. But there is so much speculation in taking railroad contracts that it wants to be well guarded. This work should be done through the Board of Trade or a Committee appointed by the people. But one thing should be guarded against, the Mormons should not underbid each other but get as much as they can for the work. Our people should grade all the railroad that goes through our settlements and if they act wisely they can get a good price for it. I think it would be well to consult with Jesse N. Smith and Lot Smith on the subject, as the work will have to be done by those stakes.  You will want to unite together upon that work, and all act honestly with each other, and let each have what he earns. I think the grading of that rail- road will give profitable business to many of our people.  Again Bro. Watkins gave me an account of some political or Elections matters with you concerning sending the next Delegate to Congress. I want to say concern- ing this matter. It is one of the most delicate things between this church and the Gentiles. There should be no step taken by any of the Saints upon this subject 
 or pledges offered by any of the people without strictly consulting with Lot  Smith, Jesse N. Smith, the Bishops and leading Mormons of Arizona.  And the next Election we should have all the County Offices of Apache Co. Our people have legal votes enough to carry it. My feelings would be to elect as a Delegate to Congress one who would be the best man, (if there is any best) and the one that would do us the most good; but the Mormons must all unite upon this matter, there should be no divisions with any of the brethren upon this point.  With regard to your entry of the land of St. John, I have conversed with Prest. Taylor and he thinks I should consult a lawyer upon this subject, and I will send you instructions what to do Therefore take no further action until you hear from me upon the subject. Perhaps we can enter a townsite under the Arizona Laws, if not we will have to pre-empt. I do not want to trust to homestead, it will take too long But we have got to have honest men, if we can find them, to enter the land. But I will send you word as soon as I can get it.  There is another subject I was somewhat surprised at, that is the price of the claim of the upper ditch, for I understood when you made the purchase that you had all the water and land except a small upper ditch that Barths charged cows for, and when there was a failure in the purchase the 50 cows was knocked off. Now they want $7,500 for the purchase, which amounts to a bout two thirds as much as all the first purchase that is something I do not understand.  Still, we as a people ought to own all of the land and water we can get, as we want as little mixture with the outside as we can help. I shall do what I can to send men and means. But many who were opposed to going make but slow headway. I have spoken to the brethren about appointing David Udell -[David K. Udall]- for Bishop of St. John and have had no opposition to it yet.  I realize that you want more Missionaries to go among the Lamanites and I will do what I can to help send men. I am glad you have good prospects for a crop, and that you have a chance to turn in barley. I think it is a fair price.  How do the brethren do about holding the claims on the meadow? Remember me kindly to J. W. Young if he is with you and say to him that I have written him  and shall write again soon.  Remember me to your family and all the Saints with you. I remain your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff 
 LeSueur  Salt Lake City May 26, 1881  Elder A. M. Tenney, Dear Brother: Your letter of March 11, 1881, is before me and I write to answer  it. I was glad to hear that all things were as favorable as they are in the payment of the St. John purchase. We have called something like a hundred men to go to St. John this season. How many will reach there I do not know. I hope it will be occupied by the Saints, so that the Gentiles will not wish to be there. I saw from a letter from Bishop Udall, that arrangements were made to enter a good deal of the land in the purchase. This I was pleased to see for I have considered this very important.  Now BrotheSr Tenney, concerning your remarks upon the railroad contracts, I wish to say that the Presidency of the Church were not anxious for our people to engage in the railroad business at all, but as so many were anxious to engage in it, the Presidency and the Twelve both felt that it was important that some of the Quorum should be appointed to go to Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado and preside over the organization of our people in these territories who were engaged in the building of these railroads, and Erastus Snow, B. Young, J. W. Young and Jesse N. Smith were appointed a committee to go to these territories and organize the camp, and to direct and control all contracts made upon that railroad and see that all camps of the Saints attend to their prayers and observe the Sabbath and to see that all labor get their pay. They received strict written instructions what to do, and E. Snow and B. Young went to Arizona for that purpose, but nobody complied with the instructions, and the consequence is that John W. Young was called to Salt Lake City and the Twelve and the Presidency have sat for days in investigating this subject, and the final decision is that John W. Young and all the others must abide by their instructions and take counsel in the matter if they maintain their standing in the Church of Jesus Christ of LatteSr-day Saints.  John W. Young has agreed to do this, to throw all of his contracts into their hands and to carry it on under their united counsel. And I would advise you and every other elder in the church, who are taking contracts upon that railroad, who are employing the Saints to work under them, to do as John W. Young has done, to take their counsel in these matters. If you are not satisfied with your settlement with J. W. Young, I would advise you to have E. Snow and B. Young to settle it between you.  Another subject I wish to speak upon and that is the Lamanite Mission. I had a great deal of confidence in you in this matter, as you had the Spanish and were qualified to labor there, and I was in hopes that you would be able to carry that mission. But it seems that you are engaged in the railroad business and I do not know whether you will ever by at liberty to do anything upon that mission. You wished me to appoint somebody else to preside and you would work with them, but I thought you the best qualified to preside over it of any one there. But as you have resigned, I told Brother Snow to accept of your resignation, if you could not attend to it, and appoint some one in your place so that the mis- sion may not be given up, for I do consider the salvation of that people of more importance than building railroads or getting rich.  I am always glad to hear from you. Remember me kindly to your family and to Brother Udall, if you see him.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City  May 27, 1880  Ammon M. Tenney St. Johns, Apache Co., Arizona  Dear Bro.  I have consulted with lawyers and friends about entering the St. Johns  purchase and after getting all the information we can, we have come to the  conclusion that the safest, best and cheapest way is to enter the land by  quarter sections. It is very difficult to enter a townsite and we have to pay  a good deal more to the Government and it takes all together too long to home- stead.  If you have not used your entry right, I would like you to enter the  Quarter which is of the most value and then put trusty men to enter the rest.  Those who enter will have to claim a house or shanty of some kind, until they  pay for it, and get a Government title before they can deed to others. You  will want to find out the sections, stakes, half sections and quarter sections,  so as not to make any mistakes about the land you enter. All persons will have  to go to Prescott to enter the land.  You will want to learn the Township, Range Plot Section, so as not to  make a mistake in the entry.  I enclose a letter to J. W. Young, which I will not seal for I have an  order in it for several persons who paid tithing to J. W. Young, and they may be  with you, some of them. I want you to see that they have credit on the tith- ing books, of whatever ward they may be in, as I do not know where John W. is,  I trust to you to send the letter to him.  I wish now to say that we decided in Council last night to send David Udell  -[ David K. Udall ]- to preside as Bishop at St. Johns., L. John Nuttall will notify  him. I have tried ever since I came, to get him appointed as Bishop of that  place, but I did not get it accomplished until last night.  I shall be glad to hear from you from time to time to know how you progress.  My love to your family and all the Saints with you and please excuse a short  letter now.  Your brother in the Gospel W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, May 31, 1880  Mr. A. M. Tenney,  Dear Brother:  I have just received your two letters and read them to Brother Taylor,  and our counsel is for you today, to those brethren who are at St. John, who  are taking land, that our counsel to them is to turn out in payment for the  land, oxen, horses, wagons, harness, or anything they have to help pay for it,  and not wait for the last day of payment.  I have written to you concerning the election. We want you to consult  with the presidents of stakes and their counsellors, the bishops and counsellors,  and all the people must unite together and agree whom they will vote for as  delegate to Congress, and then all write and vote for your county officers. The  Mormons have a great majority of votes in Apache County, and it is a duty they  owe to themselves to put their own men into office. You write to Lot and to  Jesse N. Smith and consult with them about it. The people must be united and  not divide in these matters.  I have already notified you that we have appointed David Wall, -[ David K.  Udall ]- as bishop of St. John and he has been notified of it. How soon he can  go I know not. You should reserve a good city lot and farming land for him.  You can ask him when he can come.  I am surprised that you have received so little pay on the purchase for  the number of men. All should understand that they cannot hold that land if  they do not pay for it, for it was bought for the Saints, but we expect them  to pay for it.  If you are likey to have trouble with the Apaches, you should all form  yourselves into a military company without delay and see that your arm and  ammunition are in good order and ready at hand.  I thought all matters were settled between Brothers Hunt and Hatch. They  agree(d) to settle and bury everything (the) night of the settlement.  I am now notifying some men at Box Elder City to prepare to go to St.  John. We will send men as fast as we can.  You need not call for any tithing stock to pay on the St. John purchase,  unless you are obliged to. I was sorry to hear that Brother Johnson had made  such a poor -[choice]- out of his settling. I told him to go to St. John. Men  who take counsel will be blessed. Those who do not will suffer.  I have only time to write a little this evening. My love to all.  Your brother in the Gospel, W. Wroodruff per J. J. 
 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona  Feb. 19th 1880  To the Latter-day Saints in St. John District:  Bleoved Brethren:  We have met in council at Sunset, and taken into consideration the situation of the town and land purchased by A. M. Tenney, and we have put a ^the^ price of the  farming land $8.00 per acre: and the City Lots at $25.00 on an average; and we have named our town "St. John," for it is at St. John. And we wish it distinctly understood, by the Saints who settle there that we do not expect to enter into any speculation in the purchase of this country, for ourselves or our Brethren.  Our labors in these matters are for the building-up of Zion, and the settling of the Saints. We have figured this matter as closely as we can, and we feel that we cannot put the land and lots at any lower price. When the land and lots are sold and the debts paid, if there is anything left, it will be returned, pro. rata, to those who have paid for the land: and if we fall short of the payment, we consider it right and just that those who have purchased the land, shall also pay, pro. rata. to help pay the debt: but we expect the price set, will pay for the land. Bro. Ammon M. Tenney was appointed to make this purchase, and we look to him to deal out this land, both city lots and farming land, to those who buy: the payments to be made to him. He is held responsible for the fulfilment of the contracts. We would like all of the Brethren that he calls upon to assist him in any matter appertaining to the settling of the place. We wish further to be understood that Brother Tenney has been appointed to preside over the settlement of St. John, and to preside over all meetings when he is present, until he is released from his responsibilities. We also appointed Brother Tenney to preside over the Lamanite Mission; the the reason that he has already opened the doors among many of the Eastern Villages, and is quite well versed in Spanish.  We have also appointed Brother J. Allred to assist Bro. Tenney, under his direction, and to preside over the meetings in Bro. Tenney's absence, until they are more fully organized. And we wish all the Brethren who take land, to do what they can, at once, to assist in the payment of the same. We have advised Bro. Tenney in relation to the Missionaries associated with him, as regards their raising grain for the season, concerning which he will instruct you.  W. Woodruff John W. Young

President W. Woodruff Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother:  I sent a copy of  the Liverpool Daily Post to Prest Snow, F. D Richards & Bro Jno. containing a report  of the mobbing of some "Mormon" Elders,  through the report of a woman that  the Elders had decoyed away her daugh- ter who had returned, with two children  and had to walk from Liverpool to  London &c. Well from advices received  from London we learn that the Elders  did not preach in that place, but  they held an open air meeting in Mile  End Road and had a splendid good  meeting and was listened to with a  good deal of attention. I suppose this  is the way the adversary is educating  his children to mob the Saints. In my  inquiries about copyright and the regis- tering at Stationers Hall I have come ac- cross the following "A copyright extends  to 42 years." Elder C. W. Symons and  D. H. Snarr, who are laboring in London,  went to Stationers Hall and obtained the 
 following information "The Doctrine and  Covenants was registered at Stationers  Hall, June 7, 1845, by Wilford Woodruff  of Stanley Buildings, Bath St Liverpool. These brethren are searching to find out  the copyrighting of all our Church works. They could find nothing of the Book  of Mormon. The officials at Stationers  Hall said if it was first published in  America, it could not be registered there. They also assert that the Doctrine and  Covenants was registered June 7, 1845 and  published June 15, 1845 eight days after  being registered and therefore gives it no  protection. The charge for searching is  one shilling a letter, it being arranged  in letters. They searched through two  letters from 1840 to 1873. They could  not find The Book of Mormon or Hymn Book. Prest Leaing is giving it his attention and  I hope before long to get all the information we  want. We are all well and rejoicing in the  truth. With kindest regards.  Your brother in the Covt Geo.

My dear brother:  I have just returned  from a very satisfactory visit to the Nottingham  Conference I left here on Saturday Afternoon 12.th inst and was met at the Depot at Nottingham by  Pres Jno H. Hays and some of the Elders from Utah. We held a Priesthood Meeting oin the everning. There  were fifteen Elders from Utah and several of the  local Presidents of Branches and local priesthood. On Sunday we held three meetings. On Monday a  meeting with the Utah elders in the morning and in  the evening I preached at Hucknall Torkard. Yesterday  after visiting at Hucknall I went to Mansfield and  held a meeting Elders H. H. Shurtliff, H Y Tilley and  myself doing the preaching. We had a most excellent  time. This conference is in an excellent condition. On Saturday last Elders L. A. Cannon, E. L. Sloan and his sister left for Utah pr. Guion S. S. Nevada. When we received your cablegram we notified these brethren and on the following  day for the departure of a Guion Co. Steamship  they left for home. Bro. E L Sloan seemed ra- ther disappointed to have to return before the  completion of his mission, but Bro. Cannon having 
 been away from home over two years and a quarter  was happy of the privilege of returning. The Lord has  kindly encouraged some of the brethren by giving  them some precious souls for their hire and seals  for their ministry that has caused them to rejoice  and take courage in their labors. I returned this  afternoon full of thanksgiving to God for all His  mercies received a most excellent letter from folks  ^at^ Nephi and rejoiced in His matchless love and  kindness. In Sundays Chronicle there is a piece call- ed "Dying Mormonism" which I enclose that you  may see how the people are being educated (?) with regard to the Work of God. How ready the peo- ple are to believe false prophets. If the "recruits from  Europe" where as benighted and ignorant as this  "Travelling Correspondent", they may well be pitied. These wiseacres speak as they would wish it to be, but fortunately for the human family and the  righteous in particular it is Babylon that is  doomed and every plant that the Father has not  planted and not His Church or the Gospel of  the Kingdom. It is mail time and our ^Wednesday^ even- ing meeting so I must conclude. I am happy  to report we are all well in health and spirits.

Elder Christian  Tueller, of Paris, Bear Lake, was appointed Clerk and  recorder. The names of the other returning missionaries  are John F.

In the company there are besides the returning mission- aries, 63 adults, 36 children, and 5 infants, total  112 souls. PrestJ. U. Stucki came with the emi- grants from the Swiss & German Mission.  Hise is well. Last Sunday I met with the Elders and  Saints in the Welsh Mission in a Conference held  at Merthyr and we had a very profitable  time. The anti "mormons" tried to annoy and break  up our meeting, but signally failed. There were  20 Elders from Utah and we had an exceedingly 
 pleasant time in our Priesthood meetings.  Tomor- row Sunday the 22nd we hold Conference at  Norwich. In our searchings after the copy right- ing of our Church Works we do not seem very hap- py but we discover enough to be assured of the  absurdity of the claim of the Pratt family. The  key to Theology was copyrighted in March 1855  by Franklin D. Richards of 15 Wilton St Liverpool. the day of the month does not appear on the  records.

October 23rd 1889.  President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, U. T.  My dear brother:  On Sunday last  I attended a Conference of the Saints in the  Leeds Conference which was held at Dewsbury  about 9 miles from Leeds. The Conference  House is at Armley, two miles from Leeds. The  only train we could use left Leeds at 6.45 a m  So we had to walk from Armley to Leeds in the  Early morning and it pouring down rain. We  got wet, it was cold and cheerless. When we ar- rived at Dewsbury it was about 7.30, no  Saints in the town and the Hall engaged  from 10 a.m. SWe stayed in the waiting room  until Prest  Tuckett went to the Hall to Ascer- tain if we could find a shelter until 10 a. m  as it was raining. It being Sunday morning  and but few trains running there was no  fire in the waiting room, we walked under the  cover of the station on the platform to keep ourselves  warm. Arrangements being made we went to  the Hall a fine cConcert Hall capable of holding  some thousand people, with side rooms for  cloak & hat rooms &c. The Elders and Saints had  taken a picnic, for all places of business were 
 closes, it being a very religious town where the peo- ple were supposed to strictly keep the Sabbath.  The janitor of the Hall did all in his power  to make the people comfortable supplying plates  cups & saucers, hot water &c which some-what  added to the comfort of the people. We held three  meetings. In the morning it was very cold,  no fires and we got somewhat chilled. In the  afternoon the gas was lit to ptemper the atmos- phere and we had some 118 strangers. I  felt quite unwell, took a chill and had every  symptoms of fever & cold. I remarked to Prest  Tuckett I was afraid I should not be able  to talk much in the evening when I was ex- pected to occupy most of the time. When even- ing came we had some 200 strangers and  after the evening singing & prayer I arose to speak  feeling pretty miserable and having nothing  to say. I commence tremblingly, but the Spirit  of the Lord came upon me and I preached  in power for about 70 minutes, and was  entirely healed. All the miserable feeling left  me and I was as well as ever I was in my  life. I was enabled to bear a strong testimony  to the truth of Joseph Smiths mission and to  plead with the people to investigate the prin- ciples, we taught, with a prayerful heart. My  subject was man's relationship with God and  the necessity of the principles of the Gospel & Atonement

Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  Your favor of the  23rd ult was received and read with much pleasure  and I have deemed it wisdom to publish it in part  for the encouragement of the Elders that they may  redouble their efforts and work whilst the day  lasts. Prest Fjeldsted writes us under date of Sep. 21st as follows "It is with regret that I must inform  you that we are meeting with quite an oppo- sition in the Aalborg Conference, as also oin  Bornholm, from which places now several  of the Elders have been banished so I have  for athe time being compelled to withdraw the  missionaries from Bornholm and send the  one (bro E. Kofford), under banishment, to Norway  where also a brother Nielsen from Aalborg  Conf[eren]ce had to go a few weeks ago, and now  Bro. C. K. Hansen, President of Aalborg Conf[eren]ce  is also banished and Bro L. C. Johnson expects  to get papers served on him in a few days, but I have changed him to another Con- ference so perhaps he can evade the officers  and remain in Denmark. The police are  also seeking after the other brethren now laboring 
 In the afternoon I explained why we partook  of the Sacrament and what we considered  essential before we could consistently do  so. Elder John B. Milner & his wife attended  Conference. Bro Milner spoke in the after- noon for about half an hour and bore an  excellent testimony, was exceedingly interesting,  and listened to with rapt attention. We had  a fine successful conference seven Elders from  Utah Prest Hy Tuckett, Abraham Maw, Rosel H.  Hunter, Thos H. Blackburn, Wm J. Critchlow  Jno B. Milner & myself. Bro's A. Maw & Hunter  have been successful under the blessing of God  of organizing a branch in Hull and bap- tizing twenty two souls. They have pretty much  to sustain themselves in that Conference, Saints  few and far between. When I returned to  42 I found your telegram relating to  Bro D. M. McAllister and must say I am  exceedingly sorry to part with him. I told  him he had better leave with this Company  on the 26th but he said he could not in  justice as he would have to see to all the  business connected with the Company but  he would leave the following Saturday and then he would be able to arrive in 
 in Aalborg Conf[eren]ce and if found will of course  also be banished." Prest Fjeldsted also says  "Outside from these troubles we enjoy peace in  the other parts of the mission and the brethren  are meeting with encouraging success in  various places." He also informs me he has  sent a native elder to Preside in Alalborg. We have  had some little encouragement also. Last Sun- day I attended an excellent Conference of the  Norwich Conf[eren]ce. There was five to have been  baptized but through some misunderstanding  two men did not meet with the others, but  three were baptized and confirmed. In the  Scottish Mission also there have been some  baptisms. Next Sunday I expect to attend a  Conference of that Mission in Glasgow. We  have the half yearly statistical reports of the  Conferences of the British Mission and find  (193) one hundred and ninety three baptisms  (155) one hundred and fifty five emigrated (53) fifty three excommunicated and (23) twenty  three died; a decrease of (66) sixty six to the mission  (3230) Thirty two hundred and thirty, officers and  members comprise the British Mission, good  & bad. We have just published our Book of Mor- mon Ad broadcast, as much as to tell the people  what the Book of Mormon is as to make business  and so leave them without excuse. We have  sold some we should not have done if we 
 the City about as soon as they would.  When you send a cable gram to send  anyone home immediately I should let them  go without any regard to business. You know  I am a minute man, but I cannot force  anyone away. Bro Mac is a man of faith  and trust in God, he is as calm as a  summer's morning, and is turning over  the business every day to the understand- ing of Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been as- sisting in the office during Emigration,  and he is getting his things together to  pack up and leave as cheerful and  unconcerned as if it had been arranged  for him to go and there had been no  telegram. Bro. McAllister is a man of God  one of natures noblemen, humble faithful  and true. I have lived with him here  two years and a third and can say that  he improves upon acquaintance. We have  in the office with us at present Bro S. T.  Whitaker who leaves on Saturday for home  and a brother George F. Phillips a young man of excellent family   as the world goes   and good education. He is about 23 years  of age. His parents are Catholics, mother is dead, 
 had not advertized but not enough to pay us  in a financial point. We keep pushing our  business to try and sell books. Our next  venture is a cheap edition of the Hymn Book  so all our children and young people as  well as grown people, can have one for  one shilling. Our cheap edition of the Book  of Mormon for two shillings and our  Voice of Warning for sixpence has been  quite a success in spreading the know- ledge of the gospel and the scriptures. The  blessing of the Lord has been with us.  He put it into our hearts to publish  these cheap editions and He has prosper- ed us in our labors. I hope for the sake  of the work and of the people the elders  will not be withdrawn from the nations until He says it is enough. There is a  pleasure in laboring for the Lord, in la- boring for Zion, if it is uphill business,  or rowing against the stream, with all  its discouragement it has its lights and  shadows, its joys and sorrows. The exper- ience the elders gain is invaluable in fact  it is priceless. It could not be gained under  any other circumstances. Elder W. P. Payne was 
 His grand father on his mothers side was a  Jew. He has always been religiously inclined  and educated in the Catholic Church speaks  French, Latin and is an organist, educated  to be a physician. He was assistant organist  at a Catholic Church. Of late he has been  dissatisfied with the Catholic Church and  had some interviews with a popular  protestant evangelist, but was disgusted  with the Come to Jesus declarations of this  gentleman and concluded the Catholic  Church was better than that. It happened  that the Priest of the Church where bro Phillips was assistant organist saw him walking  with and in conversation with the Evan- gelist, and one evening after vespers when  Bro P had been playing, the organist being  absent, the priest came to him and asked  him what he was talking to the evangelist  for, and Bro Phillips told him he was in- quiring into his faith and principles. The  Priest sharply reprimanded him and  Bro P. defended himself and told the priest  he was far from being satisfied with the Catho- lic Church. This added fuel to the fire, he was  told that to doubt was to be damned &c and en- ded by cursing him and discharging him 
 unwilling to return he made a most excellent  missionary. And as a general thing all the  Elders say when spoken to about their release or released "Just as you say Bro. Teasdale" we  are in the hands of the Lord." This is the result  of intelligence, they know this is the Work of  the Lord that we are engaged in and that  theirre is an order in His Curhurch and feel safe  in sustaining that order. Your letter concern ing the release of Bro. A Judd has been re- ceived. We have telegraphed him for the  5th of October Company if he can get  ready. He will be missed in the Hol- land mission. Bro. Brown writes me  he does not know what to do with the  last three missionaries who have been  appointed to Holland as they cannot speak  the language and it takes a year before  they can be of any service to the mission  He is in want of elders who can go into  the field and push the sale of the Book  of Mormon and be an immediate help  to him. Our good friend Mr Ramsden  has just apprized us of the accident  that happened to the Wisconsin Company  that Bro. W. P. Payne had charge of. Is it 
 from the situation of assistant organist. He  was occupying a position as assistant to  a physician as he was training for the  medical profession. One day he saw a  scrap of a newspaper with a letter from  a Mormon Elder writen on it. He had al- ways believed the Mormons were a wicked  people. He was impressed to inquire about  them and he wrote to the Glasgow Mail to  make inquiry about the location of the  "Mormons" in Glasgow where he could gain  information concerning them and they directed him to the "Millennial Star Office"  and he wrote for information. We sent him  some tracts and referred him to President  S. T. Whittaker. A correspondence was open  between them and Bro Whitaker let him  have some tracts and he got quite interested  One day he went out to visit a sick child  leaving one of the tracts on the desk. During  his absence the physician he was with  saw the tract and read some of it and  when Bro P. returned he censured him  exceedingly for reading such stuff  Bro P. defended himself and the princi- ples advocated in the tract and this  led to the his dismissal from the physicians  employ. Up to this time he had not been 
 not wonderful that no one was killed or  crippled in such a terrible smash up? Sure- ly it is another evidence of the matchless  love and power of God manifested in the protection of His people. It is marvellous!  Mr Ramsden has also caused the Post to  insert another paragraph concerning  that canard they published about "Mob- bing Mormon Missionaries" Mr Ramsden  says in a letter to me "I sent one of the copies  of the "Star" to the Daily Post and asked them  not to give you the trouble of inserting  such articles for the future I think it will  do them good and make them more care- ful in future." Mr Ramsden is our true  friend. I often think if we were all as faith- ful in our sphere as he is in his we would  all do pretty well. And this man cannot  see the truth as the Saints have the privilege  but if he was a member of the Church  he could not treat our people better  than he does. I should like to know if the  Post would have published that at our  request? I doubt it very much for it has  always been very bitter towards our  people. I am happy to say we are all 
 baptized he was only investigating read- ing and attending meetings. When it  was known he was investigating and  likely to embrace the mormon faith it  caused the greatest consternation. The  priest was sent to reason with him  his father persuaded him but he stood  his ground got cursed by the priest and  disowned by his father. He had asked  for baptism but had been put off to  be more enlightened, count the cost &c  Bro Whitaker seeing what a cross he  was taking up was slow to baptize  him. However as there were some  converted to the truth who disired Bro. Whitaker to baptize them before he left  Bro Philips was baptized same time. A  number of strangers were present at  the baptism and confirnation. Through  this step Bro Phillips father has turned  his back upon him, would not speak  to him not even to say good bye. They  kept his clothes. He came here with Bro  Whitaker to see me. He wrote me to say  he was willing to do anything the Lord  had for him to do. I saw him and 
 well in body and mind. We thank you  very kindly for your faith and prayers  and for the prayers of your counsellor's  and the Twelve, for they are certainly  answered. Jarman & Co are continuing their  lectures because there is money in it, but they  seem to have lost their influence. We are  letting them severely alone and this seems  the best way to do. The Lord is certainly  able to do His own work, and from the  very fact that He has allowed Jarman & Co.  to travel and vilify His people for so  many years is an evidence that it is  for a purpose hereafter to be developed.  With kindest love to the First Presidency,  The Twelve and all associated with you and with continual prayers for your wel- fare and blessing  I remain, as ever, Your brother in the gospel George Teasdale 
 conversed with him at the Conference of the  Scottish Mission, he was not in the Church then.  I had intended to let him go into the field  and labor to give him an experience but I  find him so useful that he has been assisting  us in the office this week. Your much valued  favor of the 25th ult came safe to hand and read  with much interest. I regret exceedingly that  you lent Bro. Galbraith any money. He was  going to work his way to Utah. He did work  his passage across the sea. He appeared to me  to have been brought into the Church for a  wise purpose in the Lord and seemed to be  an honest man. I should not have taken  the liberty to introduce him to you if I had  dreamed he would have taken an undue  advantage of the introduction. He expressed  himself as desiring to spend his life in the  service of God and teach the young, preach  the Gospel and labor anyhwere he might be  of use. I only wanted you to see him and  if you thought proper and there was a va- cancy in some of the coutown or country set- tlements where he gcould get an experience  after he had got located that he might have  the chance of it   But I am ashamed of having  written so long a letter so will conclude with Kindest love from all to all your brother in the Gospel  Geo. Teasdale.

Teasdale 11 Dec. 1889 [end of sideways text]  Dear President Woodruff,  Your telegram, or rather cable  gram, of the 5th inst, was received early in the morning of Thurs day; before any one was up the boy from the Telegraph Office,  was vigorously knocking at the door. We telegraphed early  morning to Bro R.d Johnson and on Friday evening he was  here; went on board ship and left Liverpool, pr Guion S. S. Arizona, on Saturday morning about 10 o'clock.  I have written to Bro. J. M. Sjodhal to stay until the  spring, and have released Prest. F. F. Hintze to re- turn home on account of his being unwell, and  having been so long away from home. He will ar- rive in Utah about the last of this month, or the early  part of next year. Bros. Stauffer and Simmons seem  settling down to work. Bro. Locander writes me he  has received blessings, enjoyments and satisfaction during  the past year far above anything he anticipated and  that he was content.  As this will reach you about Christmas, I shall  do myself the pleasure, of wishing you, your  counsellors, and the Twelve, a happy peaceful Christmas, with your family and friends. May  the blessings of the God of Israel attend you  in all your administrations. Although I  am absent in body, I am with you in  spirit and in love, you all have my warm 
 affection, and fervent prayers, offered in the  warmest brotherly love, and deep desire for your  blessing and welfare; and that we may all  have the great privilege of overcoming and  enduring unto the end in the Church and  Kingdom of God, and obtain an inheritance  in the Kingdom of heaven.  Presuming that you have seen our Brother  D. M. McAllister, and that he has given you a  better discription of the condition of this miss- ion than I can on a sheet of paper; I have  said little at this time, reserving what I  have to say until the end of the year. It is  an anxious time with us now, to know how  we are going to come out in our twelve months work. When we send our yearly statement  I shall be pleased to give you further in- formation.  May the blessings of our heavenly  Father be continued unto you, and all the  faithful of the House of Israel. With kind  love to all, I remain,  Your brother & fellow laborer, George Teasdale  P. S. All at 42 desire to join me in every  expression of affection & confidence, and Compli- ments of the season. We send November State- ment to-day.  G. T.

October 29th 1889.  President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  On Saturday  last, the 26th inst, a company of Latter-day Saints  left Liverpool, pr Guion S. S. Wyoming. There were  116 from Scandinavia, 24 from England,  6 from Holland, 3 visitors, 9 missionaries from  Scandinavia, and 3 from England, making in  all 161 Souls. They were under the presidency  of Elders A. L. Skanchy Prest, Ola Olson 1st, and  C. C. A. Christensen 2nd Counsellor and Secretary.  F. Jacobsen, Olaus T Nielsen, Julius Johnson,  Chas. K. Hansen, J. J. Nielsen, & Edmund Sanderson,  (the last named returning through sickness) from Scan- dinavia and Samuel T. Whitaker, Samuel A Blair,  and Thomas Beard of the British Mission. Bro.  John B. Milner and wife and a Mrs. Brown  were the returning visitors. On Thursday evening,  the 24th inst, whilst we were holding a fellow- ship meeting in the prayer room at 42 with the  returning missionaries and some of the Saints,  a number of missionaries arrived per Guion S. S. Arizona. F. C. Mickleson, J. P. Olsen, John  Johnson & Ole Olsen for Scandinavia Orson Merrill  Edward Peay, Ezra C. Rich, Chas R. Lyman, W. B. Gibbons. 
 for the British B. Heertjes, for the Holland, and John  Schweizer, for the Swiss & German Missions. Those for  England are appointed as follows E. C. Rich and  Chas R. Lyman to Birmingham, Edward Peay to  Leeds, W. B. Gibbons to Norwich and Orson Merrill  to the Newcastle Conferences. There were also  some visitors O. P. Arnold, C. S. Burton & wife,  T. Williams, Mrs Jane Ferguson & daughter  Mary and Mrs Morse sister in law to Bro Rd Morse now presideing over the Welsh Mission.  There are some few persons left who wish to  emigrate, but who have not been able to get  ready with our companies; so to prevent anyone  being disappointed we have arranged to  send them on the 16th of November pr Guion  S. S. Nevada. Our Brother McAllister leaves  on Saturday per. Guion S. S. Arizona, and we  are exceedingly sorry to part with him. I wish  he could have finished up the year with us.  Bro L. R. Thomas, who has been assisting  us in the office during the emigration sea- son, will hold the books until the successor  of Bro. McAllister arrives. He should be a good  accountant and business man. Bro Macallister  has been first class help, and he is a gentleman  and Latter-day Saint who appreciates the honor  and privilege of being a citizen of the Kingdom  of God and a standing in the Church of Christ,  which many do not seem to sense, I am sorry to say. 
 Brother George F. Phillips, of whom I wrote  you in my last of the 23rd inst, is still with us.  I have not had any conversations with him  but have let him take his own course. He  has been keeping in the office. He bore a very  good straitforward testimony on Sunday at  our testimony meeting, and seems to feel very  well in the Church. He has made covenant  with the Lord by sacrifice indeed. This is an  evidence to us how capable God is of per- forming His own work and bringing the seed  of Israel into His fold. How many have been led by a scrap of paper into His Church I see  by the papers that our Quorum has been fil- led, which is a satisfaction to me because I  think at the advanced stage of the work  we ought to learn our duty to God and in- quire of Him to know who He wishes to fill  vacancies. I recognize we are the Church  of Christ and the order of that Church.  You are the head of the High Priesthood  the chief apostle of the Church of Christ and  have a right to the revelations of God. We  all sustain you as a prophet, seer and  revelator and ask God to reveal His mind and will unto you that His will may be  done. We all want the will of God done not  ours or anyone elses' but His will. It is His 
 Church we are members of, He is our Father in  Heaven, our God and Redeemer, all we have  we owe to Him, all we ever expect to enjoy  we look to Him for, and it is natural we  should be jealous for Him, that He may be  sought after, inquired of, honored and  obeyed. He has established His Church and  He is going to extablish His kingdom with  those who love Him and delight to serve  Him, and who are jealous for Him. We have  been a Church long enough to know something  of the order of His appointing and for one  I say let His order be honored and let Him  be inquired of and He will direct. This is just  what we are all praying for that His will  may be done on earth as in heaven I say  Amen with all my heart because this is just  what I truly want to see. It matters little to me  whom the Lord calls, for I am a brother and  friend of every man who is a Latter-day Saint in good standing and full fellowship in  the Church of Christ. There are so many good  and competent men to day who are capable under  the blessing of God of fulfilling any poition to which  they might be called, but they want to be just were the Lord wants them and to do just what He wants  them to do and would not wish for any position  only as they are called by Him, knowing they  are all the same in His sight and their labors of  equal value all working for the same recompense. 
 of reward viz Endless lives in His glorious  presence. If it is a strait and narrow way  it is open to all who love God and delight  to keep His commandments; members of  all quorums being equally honorable. For  it is not the position that makes the man,  or ^is^ a sureity of success, but it is the man  of God who is humble, childlike, true and  faithful, enjoying the fellowship of the Holy  Ghost, who makes the position an honor- able one in any quorum or in any position.  The man who honors God is honored by  Him in whatsoever calling or responsi- bility he is called to, Priests of the order  of Aaron often being blessed in a most  miraculous manner on account of their  faith and good works. I am thankful for  the men God has given us to be our com- panions in our Quorum and hope we shall  be one with each other, and as a Quorum,  and with the First Presidency, that we may  be Christs', that we may be sanctified by  the Truth, and he the servants of God in  very deed. May the Holy Ghost be our con- stant companion that we may all see eye  to eye and be a blessing to the House of Israel.  May we be humble and full of love possessing 
 faith, hope and charity, being temperate in  all things intrusted in our care, working  out our own salvation and laboring with  an eye single to the glory of God. This is my  prayer, and if I had the power to confer  a blessing upon the heads of my fellow ser- vants ^this^ would be the blessing I would confer  upon all, with deepest love and fraternal  affection. God bless the First Presidency and  God bless the Twelve and unite them toge- ther as the heart of one, to bless and be  blessed, and set a righteous example  to all quorums, and to all Israel for  brotherly love, humility, faith, hope  and charity to the glory of God the  Father is the prayer of His unworthy servant.  With kindest love to all  I remain as ever Your brother & fellow laborer George Teasdale.

Dear Brother:  On Saturday last  our Brother McAllister left Liverpool per. Guion  S. S. Arizona. Such sudden changes are never  very pleasant, especially with book keepers. When your telegram reached us we were in the midst  of the business of shipping off a company of  Saints. Bro. Mc Allister has worked assiduously  to get his books posted up and in some shape  to hand over to Brother L. R. Thomas so that he  could hold them and carry on the business  until Bro. McAllisters' successor should be  sent. Bro Mc set up the whole of  Friday night working to have the accounts  in good condition. Bro. Thomas is doing very  well for a young man as you will see from  the Balance Sheets for October. As you will soon  see Bro. Mac he will give you quite a history of  our doings and hand you a very handsome- ly bound large sized Book of Mormon for  the Tabernacle and a Psalmody. We furnish  the unbound copies and Mr Fazackerly binds  them free of charge. They are exceedingly  handsome and will be a pleasant souvenire 
 from old 42 Islington and our friend Fazackerly. Your greatly esteemed favors of Oct 19 and 17th  have come safe to hand. The reason why Elder  L. A. Kelsch did not go to Turkey was because he  could not get a passport. It is no use anyone  coming here without a passport, for they cannot ob- tain one in this country. Bro. Kelsch tried all he  could and made it a subject of prayer but was  refused and that is why we put him into the field He wrote home to try and get a passport but failed So we have appointed him President of the Bris- tol Conference where he is laboring at present. I have received letters from J. M. Sjodahl and  W. H. Smart wishing to be released from the  Turkish Mission through sickness. Bro. Smart writes that Bro Socander is down  sick also. I enclose their letters and shall  be pleased to know what to do. A few days  ago I sent ( 6.0.0) six pounds and an en- couraging letter to Bro Sjodahl. Bro. W. H.  Smart has never had much faith in the  mission since he has been there. Bro Stauffer  is the only one who seems to be really doing  anything. The last letter I got from Bro  Hintze he seemed to be doing but little in  Constantinople. He wanted  10.0.0 to get some  letters or articles into the Newspaper as he could  not get any printing done. With kind regards  Your brother in the gospel George Teasdale 
 Br. Woodruff. Mothers, Daughters, and Sisters in Zion, I feel happy to have the privilege of meeting with you, but  think it a difficult matter to speak to such a congregation.  It requires the spirit of God to speak and teach the sisters  in their duties. God has taken the weak things of the world  to confound the wise. Said that Joseph Smith  organized the Female Relief Society as he did the church  by revelation; that when he did organize this Society, he  had an object in view; so also did the Lord.  Spoke on fore-ordination: clearly showing that the Lord  known unto his servants, those things that should come  to pass down to the present day. The Lord has  prepared people to carry on His purposes that would  not be thwarted. Said the Lord had foreordained that  these mothers should come forth in this day and gen- eration to raise up a people to carry on His work.  That they had a mission just as important as the  Brethren, but they must be co-workers with each other.  Spoke at some length upon the sisters having the power  to controll the fashions; did not care how beautifully  we dressed, so that it was of comly and home-made.  Encouraged the sisters to cooperate in these things untill  we become independent of Babylon. Referred to Brigham  City as an example in cooperation.  Spoke at some length on selk culture, and showed  the nescessity of cultivating the mulberry tree, and encouraged  the sisters to enter into this with a will. Also spoke of the  laying up of grain, in case of famine for it will surely  come. Spoke of the power the sisters have in assisting  to build temples and gather the poor. Spoke of the  responsibility resting upon mothers in bearing children  and training them to bear of this Kingdom.  Said there is many trials attending the principle of  Prural Marriage, but there is also the greatest blessings  attending the same. Made some very pleasing remarks  on this subject. Asked the blessings of God on all. Amen.

April 15th 1890  President Wilford Woodruff and Council.  Dear Brethren:  On the 6th of April I attended a very good Conference of the Scot- tish Mission. Our priesthood meetings and assembly of the Saints were attended very satisfactory and an excellent spirit prevailed.  Last Sunday I attended the Newcastle Conference and had quite a number of strangers attend. Although but few baptisms the Elders have much joy in their labors.  Last week Elders Carlisle, Fraser, the Young Brothers and others arrived and received their appointments as you will see from the Millennial Star9. On Saturday the 12th inst. Elders W. H.  Smart and Richard Yeates left here for home per S. S. Alaska  Your favor of March 22nd received. I had read in the Deseret News that two dollars was to be al- lowed the passengers from New York to Utah for provisions, and could not understand it, but your letter explains that this two dollars is to help pay provisions on the railroad and incidental expenses." I am afraid this will cause some confusion. If two dollars is to be returned to the 
 passengers, would it not be easier to charge them $60 sixty dollars and thus save any fur- thur trouble. The presidents of the Companies have much to do already and to have the responsibility of giving every passenger two dollars at New York or a part of two dollars after some necessary expenses have been paid will increase his labors and make him a tar- get for the passengers to accuse and find fault with. I think we should do all we could to prevent confusion and guard against giving room for complaint. I was sorry when I read the notice in the News that two dollars was to be spent in provisions. If it had been sixty dollars for the fare and understood as here- tofore they have to provide themselves provis- ions over the R Road, they do it. But if they know two dollars is to be given them at New York for provisions they will think that is sufficient for the journey and look to the President to provide them. He has had to do this ^for some^ on several occasions in the past and have so reported to this office. We have to deal with a jealous people and it is a thankless position to have to serve them. I have had an experience with them for years and  have not wondered when men apostatised because of the people. The best way to handle them is strait and give them no chance for

Dear President Woodruff:  Your letters of Nov  25th, 26th, and 29th all came to hand on the  same day, and were read with indiescribable feelings, Iand I have suffered more than I can  express, because of my affection for you. With  regard to Thomas Galbraith I am sorry for  him because he has been over come by the  power of the adversary. I am satisfied he  had a desire to serve God. He was going to  work his way to Utah. He never asked me  for any money. When I found he was deter- mined to go I thought the matter over and  talked it over with Bro. McAllister and the brethren here. One morning, before I said  anything to Galbraith, I told the brethren  I had concluded to offer him a loan to  help him across the continent, for I thought  he was honest. He had been told he would  have to meet difficulties, that he was going  to a new country where he was unknown and  he would meet with people who would en- deavor to poison his mind, to discourage him  and lead him out of the Church; but he  was prepared for this he had read a great  deal against the people, but he knew he

April 19th 1890.  President Wilford Woodruff, and Council.  Dear Brethren:  A small company,  the first of the season, left here this morning, per Guion Steam Ship Wisconsin, under the  presidency of Elder Orson H. Worthington, with  Edward A. Cottrell and Daniel H. Snarr as  his counsellors, and Thos. E. Bassett clerk and  recorder. The following named brethren returning  missionaries, Timothy B. Davis, Jenkyn Thomas, T. E. Ricks Jr, Joseph H. Ward and E. L. Burgoyne. The company consisted of 43 souls without counting the missionaries. 32 full fares 4  halves 6 between 1 & 5 years and 1 infant = 43 souls 9 missionaries  = 52. 19 were for Salt Lake City, 7 for Ogden, 2 for Nephi  7 for Provo, 1 for Evanston, 11 for Market Lake Idaho, 3  for Farmington, 1 for Logan, and 1 for Montpellier = 52. As we have received no advices concerning the  fares north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork,  we have been obliged to guess at it, and have ad- ded the difference we paid last year to the places  north of Ogden and South of Spanish Fork not knowing  what better to do. According to your instructions we  have made out the lists at $45.25/100 fortyfive dollars  and twentyfive cents and opened an account with 
 had a work to do, and was willing to devote  himself to the service of the Divine Master, and  prepared for the difficulties and quoting scrip- ture, with which he seemed to be familiar, that  the Saints would have to suffer tribulation. When I spoke to him I told him I thought him an honest man, and had come to the conclu- sion to loan him sufficient to pay his overland  journey personally. I told him I did not know  why I did it, because I had little faith in men, my experience had taught me that there was a great deal of dishonesty in men, and that he  need not thank me, but thank God who had  softened my heart towards him to take a  step I was not in the habit of doing. I told  him the difficulties he would have to meet  with, and that he had to establish a character  amongst a people who would naturally  look upon him with suspicion, because  so many frauds had imposed upon them, that they wanted to know men before  they were willing to invite them into their families. Galbraith heard me lecture to a  Scandinavian Company, who were leaving  here for Zion, telling them in my plain flat- footed way, what they might expect and  the experience they would meet. And he  said to me, no one could misunderstand  that, and he was struck with the disposition 
 suspicion or to think they do not receive what they ought to receive and accuse an innocent man who happens to be their servant.  I know you will pardon me for this suggestion.  I only know to honestly give you my views which are the result of my experience and  submit them to your consideration, and then I shall do just as you say. With this company that leaves here on Saturday next, the 19th inst, we shall give the President of the company two dollars for every adult passenger to pay expenses and furnish some provisions. We shall instruct the brethren with him to assist him all in their power. We have done so on previous occa- sions and have received word from the  President of the Company that after they left Liverpool they took no further in- terest than to look after the Saints they were more immediately interested in. It is not all men who are willing to put them- selves out of the way for the convenience  of others. I would suggest that if the pass- engers are to have a rebate of two dollars that it be given them here, on their leav- ing, and so save the President of the Com- pany, who has all he can attend to with- out this extra responsibility. I am sure the 
 the climate and he wanted to go home. We let him  have the means to go as he was without and has  promised faithfully to send it back to me as soon  as he returns home. The Guion S.S. brings us a few  missionaires and visitors. They landed here this morn- ing. The following are their names and appointments  Thomas H. Woolford, to the London Conference  Geo H. Robinson and Ether E. McBride to the Liverpool,  Geo. Hanks, to the Bristol; Samuel Worsencroft, to the  Manchester and Joseph Newbold to the Nottingham  Conference; Jos S. Douglas to the Irish Mission. H. H. Akert for the Swiss & German, Ola Jenson L  Dahlquist, L. J. Hernstrom, C. Olsen and Joseph  R. Olsen for Scandinavia. Bro. Wm Langton and  wife, Francis T. Bailey & wife, Captn J. D. Wright Doug- las Watson, Brother H. H. Thomas' wife and others  whose names I have not yet got. All are in good  health & spirits. They came by the S.S. Wisconsin and  arrived to day. All but the missionaries have left for  their destinations or friends where they are visiting. Bro J. E. Carlisle met with an accident which has  somewhat lamed him. He was jammed between a  tram and cab and bruised considerably. I am happy  to say he has almost recovered. We learn from the papers through their American telegrams that "A consignment of Mormons  landed at New York (14th) yesterday It is believed that these peo- ple are nothing more or less than contract laborers and  it is the intention to raise that point when the next batch of Mormons is landed" This is going the rounds of the press. We are all well at 42 & join in love. Your brother  Geo. Teasdale. 
 Mr R. Tenbroeck at these figures and have mail- ed him names and lists of full and half fares so he can have the tickets ready for the company  on their arrival. We cabled you to-day "Fifty  two sailed send Tenbroeck 1770 " The account figured  at $45.25 for Passengers and missionaries was $1990.04 We sent by Prest Worthington $22000 and cabled you for  1770 00/100 making $1990.04. We also gave the President  of the Company (8600) Eighty six dollars to pay any  necessary expenses and furnish some provisions on  the journey. As an evidence of how this is understood  he asked me if it could be used for provisions for  the returning missionaries, or tipping the saloon  stewards. To handle this emigration business re- quires experience. I do not know how we would  have got along if we had a large company. It took  the brethren all their time to manage this small  company and sit up all night to do it, and they  are good bookkeepers but not used to this busi- ness. With new hands on everything I am getting  an experience in patience. Mr Ramsden is as  kind and considerate as ever. Our returning mis- ionaries all had saloon passage, one of them the odd  one, a cabin to himself. According to your wish we sent  Bros. Ricks and Bassett, two good missionaries. There  is a call for good help in nearly all the Conferences to  fill the place of those leaving. With kind love to all I remain faithfully yours in the Kingdom of patience  George Teasdale 
 Scandinavian brethren would have pre- ferred the fare being 6000 or 6100 sixty or  sixty one dollars and all expenses paid and find their own provisions, than the rebate Of course you may have some idea  that assures you of the wisdom of the rebate that I am unacquainted with,  for I do not assume to have much wisdom, I think sometimes I am very dull of comprehension and wish I had  more wisdom and prudence, and could see with clearer judgment. Yet I do the best I can to my poor ability and regret it is so poor.  I am happy to say we use all reasonably well; The last attack I had gave me a severe shaking, but I am getting along wonderfully. We have had of late many evidences of the power and goodness of God in healings and blessings, and glorify His Holy Name. The brethren in the office always desire their kindest re- gards whenever I write. Bro. Thomas is improving in health. Bro Carlisle is taking hold of his labors. Bro Hoge is doing well &  Bro Phillips is a help to me.  With brotherly love I remain as ever yours George Teasdale. 
 to truthfulness as to the real state of affairs in Utah. Prest Woodruff you know we never offer any in- ducements, outside of the gospel of Christ. We tell the people in Christ they will have peace but in the world tribulation. No Elder ever of- fered any inducement to T. Galbraith to go to Zion  by "false and cruel arguments." He went be- cause he wanted to go, and all the promises  of tribulation, persecution and difficulties, could not deter him from going. He deceived  us all. We all thought him an honest man: he possessed a testimony and enjoyed the  Spirit of God, and God has been his friend  and would have established him in His  righteousness if he had not turned his back  upon Him. Dear Brother Woodruff, there is  nothing I have done I regret in this business  except giving him an introduction to yourself. I humbly ask your pardon for so doing. It  was done in haste without reflection and I  cannot excuse myself. It is the first time I  have been guilty of this unwarrantable  liberty, you may depend upon it being the  last. The suffering I have had in this unfor- tunate experience will certainly be a warning  to me to never repeat it. The loss of the money  advanced him I count a light thing. My suf- fering arises from the knowledge that an act of

The burden of my  cross has been increased by my own unwise  act. Of late I have had all I can stand  up under. Bro. McAllister leaving, Bro. Brookbank being sick ha[ve] all increas- ed my cares and labor. The work in  Turkey no doubt is very discouraging. It  is not usual for the brethren to address  me over their presidents. All the brethren  are honored in their positions so far as I  know. I had only a few days before writ ten to Bro. Locander, who does not seem to have  taken very much to Prest Hintze, on the relation  of the Presiding Priesthood and necessity to la bor where appointed and not leave one field  for another; and to be in harmony. I have found  a correspondence between T. Galbraith and  Bro. McAllister which I have had copied and forward you by this mail. I can- not express to you how deeply I am humi- liated nor how deeply I suffer because I have  caused you to suffer for which I can never  forgive myself. God bless you with His unspeak- able peace and comfort your heart is the earnest  prayer of your unworthy brother  Geo. Teasdale 
 in the least, they cause its sectarian advocates to tremble while in discus- sion. It is because the faith of the  pseudo-Christian is a pervrsion and built upon sand, that when the tide of free thought and opposition surges against it its fall is sure. In our efforts, during the last few Sundays,  to declare the words of life in their  midst, we have endured much inter- ruption and a great deal of contumely  years absence I [3 illegible words] labors exceedingly, and spent some of the happiest days of my life in Aus- tralia. Now that my labor here is nearly finished, I raise my voice in gratitude to God for His continual mercies towards me in preserving my feet from the gilded paths of Satan and that I have been led to evade my enemies, among whom He has prepared a table for me many times.

 booked to Nephi, Milford, Logan, Brigham City,  Juab, Soda Springs, Monteplier, Franklin & Arizona We are at a stand still to know what we are to do about these places as we have receiv- ed no information concerning them. Prest Felydgsted of Copenhagen is waiting for the fares to publish to the Saints in Scandinavia. The Swiss and German frequently wish to go to Bear Lake or Southern Utah.  Bro. Thomas is with us. He has a fearful cough. We are nursing him and if he can get over it he wants to stay until the fall. We are having a pleasant opening for spring. Not much demand for herths in this first Company so far. The Easter holidays are just upon us. Next Sunday, April 6th, we hold a Con- ference of the Scottish Mission and the Sunday following of the Newcastle Conference. We are resonably well at 42 considering the anxieties we have had lately.

 ance to us since he has been here. He is growing in- to the knowledge of the gospel, bears his testimony  and is very humble and willing, does not expect  any salary, and willing to go and preach the  gospel. He is astonished at his own conversion,  because he knows it has not been by the power,  logic, or wisdom of man, and is convinced that  the Lord has brought him into His Church and  given him a testimony for some purpose and de- sires to fulfill anything He has for him to do. He has had quite a struggle with opposing in- fluences the pleading of his friends, and the  change from having all the money he wanted  to be without anything. We have not encoura- ged him at all or taken him into our con- fidence. We gave him 20/- to go home as he  had been here some time and was feeling ra- ther blue and I thought if he had the means  he would return, that perhaps he was to proud  to ask his father after he had been so treated by  him. But he did not go, and afterwards I learn- ed his sister had sent him word, she presumed  he was cured of his folly by now, having found  us out, and discovered what kind of people we were,  and if he wished to return she would send him what money he wanted. He has been quite a help to us since  Bro. Brookbank has been sick. But if you would ra- ther that he should not work here, that is enough he will  leave. With love, I am your brother,  George Teasdale.

President Wilford Woodruff & Council:  Dear Brethren:  A company of Saints from the Scandinavian & Swiss & German Missions left Liverpool today per Guion S. S. Wyoming in charge of Elder Erastus C. Willardson, with Elders James Poulsen as his first and Henry Wintch as his second coun- sellors, and J. M. Sjodahl clerk and recorder. The names of the other missionaries returning are as follows Elders John Dahlquist from the Scandinavian, and Henry Brandley, Godfrey Lienhard, Angus J. Cannon, Wm L. Hansen, & Fredk Inebrint from the Swiss & German Mission John J.  Carlson from the Scandinavian and John Hays from the British Mission. 12 returning missionaries in all, 170 souls from Scandinavia, 94 from Swiss and German 8 from Holland and 8 from the British Mission Total 292 souls. 169 full and 52 half fares. We telegraphed you this evening and called for 2000 dollars to be sent to Mr. Tenbroeck. The returning Missionaries and Saints were very comfortably situated. Last Sunday I attended a very good Conference in London which was well attended. I am satisfied a good work is being  169 + 52 = 221 
 It is very han[d]somly bound. Prest Brown is pushing the gospel in Holland, he wants more capable help. When the language has to be learned it is sometimes twelve to eighteen months before the Elders can preach the gospel. He wants some help now. The last missionary Elder H. C. Gelderblom does not seem to take very well with his countrymen. The work in England is rather discouraging in baptisms and the indifference of the people. At a District Meeting held in the Manchester Conference, there was a good attendance. Next Sunday I expect to attend a Conference of the London Conference. We are having a number of visitors. Elder John W. Young his son Willie and David H. Cannon. They are in London at present. Bro Wm Langton & wife are in Manches- ter R. F. Neslen in Lowestoft all expect to be in London on Sunday, with several of the Utah Elders and other visitors. Prest G. Q. Cannon has telegraphed for Angus to return first steamer He was expecting to leave by the June 7th Com- pany but we are trying to have him leave by the "Arizona" next Saturday. We are all pretty well considering. We have just received the news of the death of Elder James Picton of Nephi which has been very much of a shock and surprise to us.

 the Liverpool, and B. S. Hunt to the Nottingham  Conferences. The brethren have all left for their  various fields of labor, after a pleasant visit in  Liverpool and to their friends.  I have returned from seeing the Scandinavian  Company off. This is our second company of the  season. There are 144 emigrants and 8 returning  missionaries, also an English family of 4 persons  making in all 156 souls. This company is in charge of  Elder Adolph Anderson with L. Ernstrom & G. S. Bastian  as his first and second counsellors. Ole Petersen, of Brigham City  N. C. Lund, of Ogden, Niels Anthon, of Spanish Fork, L. P. Niel- sen, of Montpelier, & A. G. Erickson of Sale Lake City. We tele- graphed you to day "156 sailed 81 full 32 half send Tenbroeck  4300." There are 148 souls without the missionaries, 74 adults,  32 half fare, 35 between 1 and 5 years, and 7 infants. = 148 and  8 missionaries = 156. Brother Anderson has his wife and  children along. His wife was only booked to New York to  see if she could get a pass over the line. Mr Ramsden  made Bro. Anderson & family exceedingly comfortable.  The Elders all had a cabin passage and were exceeding  well pleased. Your much appreciated favor of the 12th  ult. came safe to hand and we have deemed it wisdom  to publish most of it in the "Star"; so that all the Elders  may know your mind concerning them. I am grate- ful to be able to report we are all well at 42 and  doing as well as we can under the circumstances.  With kind love  Your brother  George Teasdale  The Guion S. S.

 done and we shall reap the fruits if we faint not. I regret to have to report Elders A. Maw and Dalrymple of the Newcastle Conference so indisposed as to warrant their return home with the June Company of the 28th if not before. It seems as if there was a warfare against the good earnest work- ing Elders. You can tell that by the num- ber who return through sickness. President Stucki is with us. He came with this Com- pany of Saints. They were well treated all along the journey. Mr. Ramsden exercises his influence in our behalf all along the route and our emigrants receive very kind treatment. I hope we shall soon have some good mission- aries to help out so many going home. Good missionaries are in demand every- where, who can preach the gospel.  We are all well at 42; just got through house cleaning. We had a visit from the sanitary officers who are very strict in regard to cleanliness and doing everything to preserve the health of the people. All here join in kind love and pray for you morning and evening at our family alter; patiently waiting for the redemption of Zion, and laboring quietly on for the recompence of reward.

 New York, Sept. 14th [18]56.  Elder Woodruff,  Dear Bro: On account of my absence  from Washington I only received your letter of the 31st  July at this place the day before yesterday. I am exceedingly thankful for the general information your letters contain and am indeed grate- -ful for the better prospects of harvest announced in your last. I have remained here for the last month expressly to get Elder Taylor to complete his account of the Murder of the Prophet. He is so buisy that it has been with difficulty that he has been able to bring his mind to the task and remain at  it. I am, however, extremely satisfied with the prospects of accomplishing the work. He thinks Dan Jones' statement of the dreams ought to be considerableed reliable. From many conversations I have had with Bro. Markham in relation to the subject I have formed the opinion that his memory is so treacherous that he would unwittingly mix other circumstances with those attending Joseph's ass- assination. His statements would therefore require criticism Elder Taylor is bothered for dates of days & hours.  Since I wrote you I have visited  your native State an account of which the boys will find in the Mormon. I am greatly obliged to Bro. Bullock & the clerks in the office for keeping me posted on the affairs at home and thank you kindly for the attention to my fruit trees.  I expect to go to St. Louis just as soon as Elder Taylor finishes his narrative of the conversation between the Governor & the Prophet, &ce.  I preached last Sunday here and according to the announcement of the brethren in to-day's Herald I am to lecture this evening on "Utah and the present position of the Mormons."  Heywood has returned to Washington and has better prospects of winding up his business affairs and hopes to 
 return to Utah this season yet. Appleby is attending a "Wood's Meeting" to-day in New Jersey. Elder Taylor is at this moment going a head with the Governor's conversation  The political atmosphere is as usual cloudy and betokens storms. The spirit of dis-union is rampant and "Bleeding Kansas" is the principal capital for the Republican party: and a battle has to be fought every week to keep up the exite- ment.  Neither Elder Taylor or myself has received any letters from our families by the August mail  I think you will find Elr. Taylor's account of Governor Ford's conversation with Joseph a splendid affair.  Please give my kindest regards to the clerks in the office I hope that by this time they have something better and more substantial than barley-meal.  Perhaps you would say a  word or two of my family in your communications so that if I fail to obtain their letters I may learn something of their whereabouts.  With best affection for self & family I am, Yours faithfully,  Geo. A. Smith.  [sideways text] George A Smith New York Sept 14th Answd April 1th 1857 [end of sideways text]
