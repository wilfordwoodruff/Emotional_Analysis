Brother Brownell was vary stubborn &amp; it was finally dicided to cut him off from the Church if He did not make confession next Sabbath the whole branch voted for this measure. Brownell called upon Brother  Wells to get council upon it Brother Wells told him it  would do him no hurt to humble himself &amp; make a confes- sion as he was required. President Young said I have often thought of the words of Solomon that a wise child was Better than an old and foolish king I could pick out many Boys in this Church 16 years old more fit for Bishops than many old men who are Bishops there are but few men who seem calculated to make Bishops The Brethren then went to Willow Creek to settle a Difficulty with Elder A Cordon the President &amp; Bishop Dives there were three or Four charges brought against Brother Cordon but when they were all investigated they did not amount to any thing as a fault all the Branch  voted to sustain him as President the Bishops councellor for the men who accused him four of his accusers were  cut off from the Church. The people did not like to vote for Bishop Dives unless he would go by the council given him He had it was said that the Bishop had a watch which he carried that was tithing property &amp; a cow they had milked all summer &amp; No credit given on the tithing Books &amp;c these matters were not much investigated. President  Young said the Twelve should look into all such matters &amp; regulate them. He asked if they saw any body there that would make a Bishop they said No without it was Elder Cordon. O Hyde thought He knew much more than Bishop Dives. President Young said He is not calculated for a Bishop He is a good man for a President and in spiritual things But was not calcu- lated for a Bishop. Their is another thing Lorenzo Snow presides over that region &amp; is a prudent wise man yet he has strong pregudices &amp; does not pull on the same strings that I do there has been a kind of a spirit to keep Dives Down But I believe if he had had the sole controll of  things there as the president opened the meetings &amp; preached to the people He would have made a good smart preacher But I never saw the man that was kept down by his superiors that could rise above it John Taylor asked who is the greatest the President or the Bishop.

Europe &amp; America have made liberal  treaties with China &amp; Jappan which have opened their ports to the trade, commerce &amp; intercourse with the whole  world which have been heretofore entirely closed up  for thousands of Generations. The Emperor of Russia  has laid the foundation for the liberation of millions of  surfs from a species of slavery which has existed for  risen in their wrath to throw off the British yoke and  rivers of Blood as it were has been caused to flow in that land and the spirit of war has been poured out upon  all Nations and France &amp; other Nations have been  arming &amp; preparing for a Deadly conflict. The whole  Earth is becoming corrupt before God, wickedness and  abominations are rapidly increasing throughout all Nations  The Gospel of Jesus Christ has beeen offered to all Nations  By the Elders of Israel whareever they could get access  to the people and the world in a great measure have rejected the Gospel and the Lord is with holding his spirit from the   ENDENTRY  worse and are becomeing filled with all manner of lying  deceavings robing whoredoms, murders Blasphemies &amp; wicked- ness of evry kind.

The United States  Govorment sent fourteen thousand men including souldiers &amp; teamsters to Heber  C. Kimball Daniel H. Wells The Twelve Apostle &amp; other leaders  of the Church, they travelled One thousand Miles &amp; expended  some thirty Millions of Dollars to accomplish this evil design  even to shed the Blood of the Lords an Hedged up their way they had to spend the winter in the  snows of the everlasting rocky mountains and live upon  the flesh of their animals and when they did enter our  valies and cities it was by the permission of the prophets  &amp; saints of God for whom they had come one thousand  miles to slay, and instead of haveing the privilege of sheding  the Blood of the Prophets in Utah but vary few of them  have been permitted to behold their faces. President  Buchannan also sent Judges &amp; officers to this territory who are filled with wickedness, madness and abominations  of evry kind, they have also laid secret plans to destroy the prophets &amp; bring distress upon the people by their  decrees from the Judgment seat but the saints have called  upon the Lord in mighty prayer &amp; the Lord has heard &amp;  answered them &amp; he has taken away the wisdom of the  Judges and their power and their folley is manifest in  the eyes of the people and the power of God is manifest in  all these things and he has preserved his Prophets Church  &amp; Kingdom, against all the wrath of the President, Congress,  their armies, Judges and all the Devils who enter into  the tabernacles of men to fight against God &amp; his saints  Judge Sinclair has held an open United States District Court  being 88 days and tried all in their power to get  up some action against Brigham Young &amp; the leaders  of the Church but have accomplished a solumn Nothing  ownly tried to persecute James Furgerson &amp; have not been enabled to do much of that for the Lord has held  them so fast that they have not been enabled to accom- plish any evil plan which they have laid.
