 Apostle W. Woodruff read the 84th Section of the Doctrine and  Covenants, Revelation given Sept. 22 and 23, 1832. Admonished the  priesthood who were called upon to preside to feed the flock.  We could  not build up Zion without the power of God to assist us.  We ought  to be kind to one another, whether husbands, wives or children.  All the  powers of earth and hell combined could not prevent Zion from  prospering, and the judgements of God will come upon the wicked.  The Lord will fight our battles.  We should study the scriptures.    He expected to leave us in a few days to visit his northern home, and  attend the Conference to be held in Salt Lake City.  He spoke of the  great work that Joseph Smith and Brigham Young had performed  in the earth in connection with the apostles and elders, and sometimes  those who profess to be Latter-day Saints speak evil of those who have  passed away.  This should not be.  Counselor John W. Young is here  with us.  He has built a woolen factory at Hoan Coppy, which is in  successful operation.  He trusted it would be a benefit to the saints  and to the Lamanites.  Hoped he would be assisted in his business.  En couraged the young to lead virtuous lives and the young men  to marry the maidens.  The Lord will remember his convenants with  the house of Israel.  Thanked the Saints for the kindness extended to him. 
 Pres't Wilford Woodruff was glad to meet with the saints  of the stake, said, "We know no north, nor South among  the saints." The nations will be chastized with afflictions,  especially this nation. "I could not find the same Gospel  taught in my boyhood, that Jesus taught, but I have  lived to hear, & embrace, & work in it near fifty years."  We are here on a mission, We have great reasons to rejoise  We have the Kingdom of God." spoke of the restoration of  the Gospel by the ancient Prophets, of Joseph Smith's  mission upon the earth, & in the spirit world. Spoke of the powers  of the Priesthood into life, & salvation, of trials & prosperity of  the saints. Encouraged them to faithfulness, & diligence. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff was delighted  to see so many at meeting, spoke of the umpopularity  of the principles of truth, & the afflications, & suffering  of our Savior, "In my boyhood I prayed a great deal  to God, that I might be permitted to live in a day, &  age in which ministers could be found who taught  the same principles which we find in the new testa-  ment, the Lord heard, & answered my prayer, & has granted  me that glorious priviledge, spoke of the magnitude of  the labor, resting upon the L.D.S their mobility to  fully comprehend the extent of their mission upon the  Earth. the growth, & progress of the Kingdom of God.  "The Prophet Joseph Smith was reserved by our heavenly 
 father for 6,000 years that he through him might bring  to light the fullness of the everlasting Gospel." Said it  was the duty of the Elders of Isreal to preach this gospel  to all the nations of the Earth, & that Gods judgements  would follow their testimony. the suffering of the Jews  because they crucified the Savior. the day of their  redemption being nigh. the afflications, & Judgements of  God upon America because of their having slain the  Prophet Joseph, said "It is necessary that we build  temples in which to administer in behalf of the dead.  God requires it at our hand, that we may stand as  Saviors upon Mt. Zion. Closed with an appeal to God  to bless his people, & enable them to carry on the Latter  Day Work.

 W. Woodruff (5 min past 1 a.m. of Tuesday) I have desired to see this day  and I would rather see this meeting adjourned. I had not seen  half a dozen of these men, the Prophet, or Brother  Brigham  but there was a strong spirit that rested upon us and we had no  experience, but I am glad I had sufficient faith to go, for I knew  it was the work of God. Joseph was a plain simple man in his  manners, I have rejoiced from that day to this, we have a quarter  of that company here. Would not there have been an offering  if we had set fire to our houses in this city? It would.    When I heard the list read I mourned over those who had turned  away. The promises given us this evening are sufficient for us to  encourage us and I hope we shall have more like them.

 THE  AUTOBIOGRAPHY  OF   WILLFORD WOODRUFF    CHAPTER 1.  My parentage, Birth, (The The misfortunes which befel me in early life,) And occupation. My Fathers family    I Willford Woodruff was the son of Aphek Woodruff, who was the son of Capt Eldad Woodruff, who was the son of  Josiah Woodruff. My Mother Bulah Thompson was the daughter of Lot Thompson All of which were born in the town  of Farmington, Hartford Co, Connecticut. My Fathers family consisted of eight sons & one daughter viz Azmon   Thompson & myself by his first wife, who Died ^with the spotted fever^ June 11th 1808, Aged 26. And married Azubah Hart for his second  wiffe who was the mother of Philo, Asahel Hart, Franklin, Newton, Julius, And Eunice, three of which  died in infancy viz Franklin, Newton, & Julius. New^ton^ was drowned at two years of age. Philo Died Nov. 25, 1827  being 17 years of age. Asahel Hart, Died at Terre Haute Ia Oct 18th, 1838, Being 24 years of age, leaving  but four of us among the living.    My life commenced with the spring. I was born in the North part of the   town of Farmington, now called Avon, March 1st 1807. Tho occupation of my Father was a miller from his youth up  which occupation I followed untill AD 1831. Variant &and divers are the lives & fortunes of men in evry age of the  world, while the path of some are strewed with flowers & ease from the cradle to the grave, with naught to disturd their  peace, others Apparrently are marked victims, of variated misfortunes, accident & dangers, the last named class is  the one in whose ranks I have stood through my infancy, childhood, youth & manhood nearly to the present time  so much so that it has seemed at times as though some invisible power or fate was watching my footsteps in order  to find some opportunity to take my life from the earth, But I can ownly attribut the continuation of my life on earth to the  present time to a merciful Providence whose hand has ben stretched out & rescued me from death in the midst of the  many dangers & hair bredths escapes which I have passed through in life, some of which I will here mention. When three years  of age, I fell into a caldron of scalding water, was instantly caught out, &and so badly scalded, that it was nine nine months  before the[y] considerd me out of danger of the effects of the accident. My fifth & sixth years was interwoven with many acci-  dents. On a certain day in company with my elder Brothers I entered the Barn & chose the top of a hay mow for a place  of diversion. We had not been there long before I fell from the great beam upon my face upon the bear floor, which ended  our sport for that day at least, however I shortly recoverd from the fall & a few weeks afterwords was again to play  in the chamber of my Fathers House on Sunday with my Brothers Azmon & Thompson, and father reproved us for so  doing, but we were so busy we could not spend time to obey our fathers ^command^ advise, And whether we disturded him or  whether he thought of Solomons advise I know not but at all events he spared not the rod of correction, and began  to flog us. we started to go below, & as we came to the stairs I was behind & hence the blows fell on me and while making  an effort to get before my brothers I made a misstep & fell to the bottom of the stairs & broke one of my arms in the fall,   so much for disobediance. It was not long before I recoverd from this misfortune & was about the streets again  It was but a short time before I narrowly escaped with my life. My father owned a stock of horned cattle 
 And among them was one cow which I called mine, one evening I accompanied my father to the barn,   to fodder them. It being in the fall of the year we were feeding out pumpkins and among our stock  Father had a large surley Bull, & while distributing the pumkpkins my cow got one & the Bull another, soon  the Bull came & got the one my cow had. I then went & got the one the Bull left, to give my cow No sooner  had I got it in my arms, than the Bull left his & came after me, I ran down a hill with all my might &   the Bull at my heels my Father seeing my danger told me to throw down the pum^p^kin but feeling anxious  to see that my cow should have her right I still held on. Bullt while the Bull was approaching me with  the fierceness of a tiger I made a miss step fell flat upon the ground, the pumpkin rolled out of my arms  the Bull leaped over me run his horns into the pumpkin & tore it to peaces & probably would have  done the same by me had I not have fallen which escape like many others I attribute to the mercy & goodness  of GOD. It was during the same year that I was again under the necessary of employing a physician  while paying a visit at my Uncle Eldad Woodruff I was standing in a porch with one arm around a  pillar leaning over the railing my arm sliped off the pillar & I fell several feet across some timber &  broke my other arm. One would naturly suppose by this time that I should begin to grow caucious  in my procedings. But not many months rolled around defore I was called to endure still heavier  fate. My father owned a lumber sawmill in addition to his flowering mill, and one morning in  company with several other boys I went into the saw mill & got onto the head Block of the carriage  to ride not anticipating any danger but before I was awere of it my leg was caught between the  head block & fender post & broaken short into, I was taken to the house & lay nine hours before my bones  wer replased which time was spent amid severe pain, but being young my bones soon nit together  & in few weeks I was again upon my feet as usual attending to the sport & of my youth.   During my confinement with this lameness, my Brother Thompson was was my companion going  through a course of the tipus fever. Thus one scene of accident after another followed me through  my youth from ymonth to month & year to year. I had occasion one dark evening to cross my fathers  meadow while doing so I run against an ox that was feeding the ox not knowing what it was concluded  to defend himself with his heels, he kicked me in the bowels but I being so near him I was rather more frightened  than hurt. Again my uncle had a load of hay to get in and for the want of help proposed for me to load  it. Although I was young I agreed to make the trial, & with his assistance I thought it loaded vary well but  befor he reached the barn he drove over a large stone & turned most of the hay over I fell onto the ground  & the load top of me. But an exertion was made & the hay removed from me as soon as possible & I  once more breathed a free element. While 8 years of age I accompanied my father with several others  in a one horse waggon about three miles from home to attend to some work, while on the way the horses decame  frightend ran dow a hill & turned the waggon over with us in it But again while in danger I was saved  by the hand of providence none of us was injured. While in the days of my youth I cluimb^ed^ an elm tree  to procure some bark & while about fifteen feet from the ground the limb deing dry upon which  I stood it broke & I fell to the ground upon my baccks which apparrently beat the breath out of  my body A cousin that was with me ran to the house & told my parents that I was dead, but   before my freinds got to me I had revived rose upon my feet & met them on the way  At Twelve years of Age I was drowned in Farmington River & sunk in 30 feet  of water and was almost miraclulously saved by a young man named Bacon I suffered  much in being restored to life. At Thirteen years of age while passing through Farmington 
 meadows in the debth of winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceding  blustering day I became so chilled and overcome with the cold that I could not travel I cralwled  into the hallow of a large Apple tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into it hastened to me  realizing more fully than I did the danger I was in. when he arived at the spot I had fallen asleep,  & was nearly insensible he had much difficulty in arousing me to a sens of my situation. he procu-  red means to convey me to my Fathers House and through a kind Providence my life was again pres[er]ved.    At Fourteen years of Age I split my left instep open with an Ax which went nearly through my foot  it was about nine months getting well. I suffered much with it.    At Fifteen years of age I was bit in the hand with a mad dog in the last stage of the hydrophobia  but he ownly dented my hand with his Teeth but did not draw blood & I was again preserved through  the mercy of God from an awful death    At the age of seventeen I met with an accident which caused me much suffering & came near  Ending my life I was riding very ill tempered horse whose temper & practices I was igno-  rant of and while going down a vary steep rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground  instantly leaped from the road & ran down the steepest part of the Hill amid the thickest of the rocks at  full speed and he commenced kicking up at the same time & was about landing me over his head am[o]ng  the rocks but I lodged on the top of his head & grasp one hand hold of each ear as with a death  grasp, expecting evry moment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks, while in this position seting  Astride his neck with no bridle to guide him but his ears, he plunged down the hill among the rocks  with all fury untill he struck a rock near breast high, which dashed him to the earth. I went over  his head about one rod and struck the ground square upon my feet being the ownly thing that saved  my life: for had I sruck the ground on any other part of my body it must have killed me instatly.  as it was my bones crushed from under me as though they were reeds. I broke twoone ^one^ of my legs  & one twice in two & put out both of my ancles in a shocking manner. And the horse came nigh  rolling over me afterwards in his struggles. An Uncle of mine saw me fall & hastened to my  relief, & got assistance & carried me to his house in an arm chair. I lay from 2 oclok in the Afternoon  till 10 at night without aids then my Father arived bringing with him Dr. Swift of Farmington  who set my bones boxed up my limbs & carryed me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my Fathers  house my sufferings were vary great; yet I had good attendance & in 8 weeks was outdoors  upon my crutches, & soon was well again.    In A.D. 1827 while I was tending a flouring mill for Aunt Wheeler in Avon Ct. I was  standing upon one of the wheels clearing the ice off A man hoisted the gate & let a full head of water  upon the wheel which instantly started as the water struck it at the same instant my feet sliped into the wheel  wheel. I immediately plunged head foremost over the rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water & my weight drew  my legs out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft & crushed to death    In AD 1831 while having charge of the flouring Mill at Collinsvill Ct. I was standing inside  of a Breast wheel 20 feet in diameter upon one of the Arms near the top clearing the ice out of it when  A full head of water was let onto it it immediately started I droped my ax and leaped to the bottom  of the wheel by the shaft & arms near 20 feet. As I struck the bottom of the wheel I was rolled  out against a ragged stone wall with ownly two feet clearance between it & ^the^ wheel the wheel caught  me and rolled me out into the water below whare I found myself without any broaken bones  but with some bruises and much fright 
 In Dec A.D. 1833. The day that I was Baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day  Saints. One of my horses newly calked kicked my hat off my head and had he struck  two inches lower would probably have killed me instantly. In Ten minutes after while driving the same  horses down a hill on a sled with loose bottom boards without a box the boards slip'd forward under the roll  caught the ground turned endways & fell on the horses backs throwing me between them under the sled  they run to the bottom of the hill draging me by the lines head foremost with the sled top of me abo[u]t  Twenty rods over a vary smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangers  In 1834 while travelling in Zions Camp to Missouri A rifle was accidentally discharged & the  ball passed through Three tents with a dozen men in each & lodged in a waggon Axletree without injury  to any one it passed within a few inches of my breast & many others escaped quite as narrow as myself  a few months after a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing at my breast within  a few feet of me h[e]avily loaded with buck shot but it missed fire & my life was again preserved  In April 1839 while in Rochester Ill. I was riding upon the running part of a waggon without  any box I was siting on the foreward Axletree and the boult came out fastning the four wheels togeth  this left the hind wheels, & my weight on the forward boulster & tongue turned the coupling pole  clear over onto the horses backs turned the stakes upside down & shot me up fast between the bolster &  tongue but in such a manner that my head and shoulders draged on the ground my horses took   fright & run out onto an open praire and they draged me in this position for about half of a   mile when I managed to guide them so as to run them into the corner of a high worm fence  whare we landed in a pile together I was considerably brusised but escaped without any broaken  bones and after one days rest was enabled to attend to my labour again.    On the 15th day of October 1846 while with the Camp of Israel building up Winter Quarters  on the west side of Missouri River then Indian Country, I passed through one of the most painful  & serious misfortunes of any of my lifife.  I took my Ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the Bluffs to cut  some shingle timber to cover my cabins. I was accompanied by two other men and while falling the third  tree I steped back of it some 8 feet whare I thought I was entirely out of Danger but when the tree  fell their was a kocrook in the tree which struck a knowl and shot and ways back of the stump and   bounded & the but of the tree struck me in the breast & knocked me several feet in the air against  a standing Oak and the falling tree followed me in its bound & caught me against the standing tree and  I came down between the two trees one falling & the other standing but before reaching the ground I was  cleared from between them & struct upon my feet it badly bruised my ^left^ thigh the whole length of it  & my hip. Also my left arm It also broke my breast bone into & 3 ribs on my left side it also bruised my  lungs vitals & left side in a shocking manner. After the accident I sat upon a log untill Mr John Garrison  went a quarter of a mile & got my horse, notwithstanding wI was so badly hurt I had to mount my hourse  & ride two & a half miles over an exceding rough road & had to dismount twice in consequence of mirey  places my breast & vitals was so badly torn to peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an  arrow I continued on horseback untill I arived at Turkey Creek on the North Side of Winter quarters  I then became exhausted & was taken off & carried in a chair to my house I was met in a thee street  by Presidents Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball W. Richards ^& others^ who assisted in carrying me to my waggon  & family before laying me upon my bed they laid hands upon me & rebuked my pain & distress in 
 the name of the Lord & said I should live and not die I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon  as my cabbin was not done, & as the Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live  & not die I employed no physician on this occasion but was administered to by the Elders of Israel and nursed  by my wife. I lay upon my bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to knit together which commenced on the   9th day I began to walk about in 20 days and in 30 days from the time I was hurt I again commenced hard labour  And it has always appeared mirraculous to me that with all the injuries & broaken bones that I have had that  I now have not a lame limb about, but me, but have been enabled ever since to endure the hardest man-  uel labour, exposures, hardship & Journeies, have even walked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles in  a day, however if I overlabour or take a severe cold I feel it more sensibly in my breast & left side than  I did before my last injury. Thus I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstances  which have attended me during life and to sum the matter up it stands about thus, I have broaken both  legs (one twice in two) both Arms, both Ancles, my breast bone & three ribs, have been drowned, froze, & scalded,  have been in two waterhwheels while turning under a full head of water & have passed through a score of other  hair breadths esscape yet the mercies of God have been over me, & my life has thus far been preserved on  the Earth For which blessing I feel to render the gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my Heavenly   Father praying that the remainder of my days may be spent in his service & the building up of his Kingdom    CHAPTER II.    My experience and Reflections upon religious subjects previous to hearing & embracing the fulness of the  everlasting gospel as tought & practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints    At an early age my mind from time to time began to be exercised upon religious subjects  but I never made a profession of religion untill AD 1830 being 23 years of age. I did not then   Join any church for the reason that I could not find any body of People, denomination, or church  who had for their foundation, doctrines, tenets, faith, & practices: that gospel, faith, principles, practices  ordinances, gifts and foundation which the Ancient Apostles Prophets & Saints Taught, enjoyed and  held forth as the gospel of Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and its attendant gifts and graces. And whenever  I conversed with ministers of the various denominations or sexcts they would universally tell me that prophets,  Apostles, Revelations, Healing the sick &c were given to esstablish Jesus Christ & his doctrin & have ever since been  done away and no longer needed in the church & Kingdom of God. This Argument I could not, nor, never  did believe. But I did believe that Revelation, the gifts, graces, & faith once deliverd to the saints which they  have enjoyed in all former Ages when God has hasd an acknowledged people on Earth has been done  away ownly through the disobedience and unbelief of the children of man I believed evry gift Office and  blessing just as necessary to constitute a true church of Christ and Kingdom of God in our day & gener-  ation as in any age of the world. This principle & belief was firmly rivited upon my mind from two  causes, first from the perusal of the bible whare I found cause and effect alike in all past ages and the same  promised in all generations to come. At the same time I could not find any change of the gospel or the plan  of salvation in the days of Christ & the Apostles or that their would be any change in the ordinances of the  gospel or plan of saving men in the last days. I learned from the scriptures that many of the Ancient  Prophets, & Christ and the Apostles, did foresee by Inspiration & Revelation and did prophesy that the Gentile  Nations as the Jews had done would would Apostatize & turn away from the true faith and church and 
 Kingdom of God that thare would be a falling away from Apostolic faith Doctrins and ordinances  and that other systems would arise in its stead, and when these fals systems had arived at their  fullness than would "the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom which should become an Everlasting Kingdom  to whose dominion should be no end." 'Then should this gospel of the Kingdom be preached in all  the world as a witness unto all Nations before the End should come" Then should the church come  up out of the wilderness and be esstablished upon the foundation of the Ancient Apostles & Prophets  Christ Jesus being the chief corner stone. Also that the same gospel and Kingdom of God with  all its attendant blessings & promises that was taken from the Jews (who had fallen through unbelief)  and given to the gentiles who brought forth the fruits of that Kingdom for a season but when they  fell away in like manners through the same example of unbelief Then the gospel & Kingdom of God  will be taken out of the hands of the Gentiles as Nations and again be restored to the Jews with all the  House of Israel And that when this gospel & Kingdom was restored to the Jews it would possess  all the powers gifts blessing & ordances which it did possess when it was taken from them.    These things I did learn from the perusal of the scriptures which made a lasting impression upon my  mind. Another cause for these principles being planted in my mind was I was taught in the   days of my youth by an aged man by the name of Robert Mason who lived in Syimsbury C.t.  He was called by many a Prophet and many of his prophesies have since come to pass to my  certain knowledge. through fasting, prayer, & the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus Christ the  sick were healed, and devils were cast out under his Acdministration, even his own son who had  become a raving maniac after praying & fasting for nine days in his behalf He arose from his bed on  the ninth day & rebuked the ^evil spirit^ devil & commanded the devil to come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ  and it instantly obeyed him & he was made whole from that hour. This man instilled those principles  into my mind also into the mind of my Elder Brother Azmon Woodruff ^and Many others^. He did not believe the church  & Kingdom of God in its organized form was among man on the Earth. He considerd that he had no  authority to administer in any of the ordainances of the Gospel and knew of No man that had, but  believed it his privilege or the privilege of any man who had faith in God to fast and pray for the  sick by the laying on off hands, and to pray for light knowledge truth visions & revelations. He told me  the day was night when the Lord would again esstablish his church and Kingdom on the Earth with  all the gifts & graces that were manifest in the days of the Savior. He said it would commence upon the  Earth before he died but ithe would not live to enjoy & partake of its blessings but said that  I should & that I should become a conspicuous actor in that Kingdom. The last time that  I ever saw him He related to me the following visinon which he had in his field in open day  "He said I was carried away in a vision & found myself standing in the midst of a vast  orchard of fruit trees I became hungry & I wandered through the vast forest of fruit trees  searching for Fruit to eat but I found notone & while I stood gazeing in amazement at not  finding any fruit amid so many trees they began to fall prostrate around me as though they were  torn up by a whirlwind & they continued to fall untill there was not a tree standing in the whole forest  I immediately saw young shoots spring up from the roots which formed themselves into young &  beautiful trees and they immediately budded, blossomed & bore fruit which ripened to maturity which  was the most beautiful of ^to look upon^ of any thing my eyes had ever beheld and I stretched forth my hand & plucked  some of the fruit, & I gazed upon it with delight, and as I was about to eat of it the vision closed  & I did not eat of it at all. I found myself in my field at the close of the vision and I bowed down 
 Before the Lord and I called upon his Holy name and asked him to make known unto me the meaming of the   vision. And the voice of the Lord came unto me saying, Son of man thou hast saught diligently to know  the truth concerning my Church & kingdom among man, this is to show you that my Church is not organized  upon the face of the earth in the generation in which you live, neither is the true fruit of the kingdom of God made  manifest among the people; but in the days of your children even the rising generation shall the Church & kingdom  of God be made manifest, revealed and esstablished upon the Earth among the children of men, then shall the  true fruit of the vine & the gospel of Christ be given unto all those who will receive it & obey the ordinances of the  Gospel of Salvation. You will live to bea made acquainted with it but will not live to partake of it before you depart this  life, but you will be blessed of the Lord after death because you have followed the dictation of the Holy  spirit while in life." when he had finished relating the vision He said to me I am satisfyed that you will  stand in that Kingdom & assist in building it up, but I shall die before I partake of its ordinances, he then  blessed me in the name of the Lord & bid me farewell, it being the Last time that I ever saw him. This was in  1828, and he was vary aged. In Dec in 1833 Zera Pulsipher came to Richland Oswego County New York  whare I was then living He was holding the office of an Elder & he preached the gospel to us in that place  and I went forth & was Baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and almost  the first person I thought off was Father Robert Mason and on my arival in Missouri nas a member  of Zion Camp, I wrote a long letter to him & other friends setting forth the coming visitation of  the Angel of God, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the esstablishment of the Church  of Christ & Kingdom of God, with the priesthood & all its attendant Blessings and all things  which I could think of connected with the esstablishment of the Church in its infancy. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] The  old Gentleman received the Letter with a great deal of satisfaction & had it read over  many times to him, & handled it (as he did the fruit in his vision) & rejoiced before the Lord  but he sonon died & had not an opportunity of receiving the ordinances from under the hands of an  Elder in the Church, but the first opportunity which I had I was baptized for him in the Font at Nauvoo.  One of the most remarkable events of Father Masons Life was he said he was called to Fast forty  days, and he commenced to fast & pray with a determination to Fast the Forty days, but he fasted  twenty seven days without taking any nourishment or food, but on the twenty seventh day the Lord  told him to arise & eat for he had excepted his sacrafize as he did Abrahams. The Lord told him  to kill a Lamb & cook & eat of it & he did so & his apetite came to him & he partook of a harty  meal without any injury to him & the next day he walked 10 miles. He considered that He fasted  the 40 days as Much as Abram offered up his son Isaac He felt that he could have fasted the  40 days as well as the 27. [##Genesis 22:1-18##] There was a reasonableness in the teachings of this man which so  firmly agreed with the prophesies & teachings of the Ancient Prophets & Christ and the Apos-  tles that I firmly believed them with all my heart, And I gave myself to the reading of  the scriptures & Earnest prayer before God day & night as far as I had an oppertunity  for years before I herd the preaching of the fulness of the Gospel by a Latter Day Saint. I  have plead with the Lord many hours, in the forest, among the rocks, in the fields, in the Mill &  at midnight that He would give unto me light, truth, & the spirit of God to lead me in the way  of salvation And my Prayers were answered untill many things were revealed unto me & my  mind was opened to the truth so much so that I was fully satisfied that I should live to see the true  Church of Christ esstablished upon the Earth & a people raised up who would do the will of God &   keep his commandments & who would bring forth the true fruit of that Kingdom 
 CHAPTER III.    The various places in which I resided. My busines and manner of Life and experience up to  the time of my being baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints    I spent my early life in the north part of Farmington now called Avon Hartford County Ct  which was the plase of my birth, as soon as I was old enough to travel two miles to school (which was  the distance to our district school house) I attended summer & winter with my two Elder Brothers  untill I was ten years of age, at which time My Father sold out his Property consisting of a saw  mill, Flouring Mill, Carding Machine, & a large Farm & a stock of cattle this was done in order to pay  his debts as he had become much involved by loaning money & undersigning men at the bank  My early sports consisted chiefly of angling for the spotted trout which abounded in the stream  which fed my Fathers Mill Pond My Brother Thompson & myself were considered the most  successful Fisherman of any persons who visited the Brook. During the winter season we would set box  traps for gray Rabits & we caught a good many. My mind was rather more taken up upon these subjects  in my boyhood than it was in learning my books at school, for in those days Parents did not feel the  importance of looking after the Education of their children any more than merely to send them to school  considering that the Education of their children was wholey depending upon the school master.    when I was 8 years of age there was a revival of religion in our Neighborhood mostly conducted by the Baptist  denomination. Elder Brooker also Elder Quishman of Hartfort County Countynecticut preached at my Fathers House  and baptized my step Mothers & several other relatives, both of my brothers made ^a^ profession of religion  I attended their meetings, & prayed with the young People & tried to get religion but it soon wore off from my  mind as it did from the mind of Brother Thompson But Brother Azmon was very faithful to his prayers  his bible & his God through all the days of his youth & manhood up to the time of his embracing the fulness  of the everlasting gospel. My Father having sold out his property in Northington now called Avon moved  with his Family to Farmington and Engaged to attend the Farmington Flouring Mill built upon Farmington  River & owned by a company by the name of Cowles Deming & Camp, He took possession of those mills  in 1818 & He continued in charge of them nearly all the time up to 1846 I remained with my Father  attending school in the Town of Farmington untill I was 14 years. The 1st of May 1821 I went to live  with Col George Cowles & remained with him two years attending school during the winter season & worked  upon his Farm through the summer. while with him during the year 1822 I passed through another great  revival of religion among the people I like the rest of my young companions attended enquiring meetings  & prayer meetings among the Pryesbeytarians they being the ownly religious society in the town I also attended their  Sundy school I laboured & prayed & tried to get religion, but there was sumthing in there manner of teaching  & exhorting us to give our hearts to God without telling us what to do or pointing out the way so that we could  understand it or comprehend it that with me it created darkness & not light, misery & not happiness & ther  teachings did not seem to enlighted my mind or do me Good although I laboured hard to obtain benefit from   it. many young people were making profession of religion but I did not wish to make a mock of those  things or profess to be converted & have religion unless I could be made sensible that I had received light  & truth & sumthing tangible that would be of benefit to me I did pray & labor hard to obtain religion  but did not feel that I obtained any special light truth or benefit in trying to follow the teachings given me at that time 
 I remained with Mr. Cowles untill June 1823 a little over two years I then returned home & spent the season  with my Father & worked in the Mill and in the fall My Father made an arangement with Mr.  Andrew Mills of West Hartford Ct for me to board with him & do chores for my board & go to school  According to agreement I soon became a member of Mr. Mills Family & for several weeks I passed  through a regular course of that distressing deisease called Home sickness I suffered immensly I had never  before lived at any place whare I had not been free & social. But Mr Mills was a proud Auste[r]e man  & I had no conversation with him ownly in being asked & answering a question & for about 2 weeks  I did not eat drink or sleep but little but I soon began to go to school & because acquainted with my  school mates & my sickness left me & has never yet returned and at the close of the school I returned  home to my Fathers house in the spring of 1824. But soon my Father Made a contract with Mr  Horace Judd for me to go & work one year with him. He was our nearest neighbor at our homested in Northington  and one of my school mates his Father having died & left him in charge of a large Family of sisters  He being the ownly son. I commenced work with him but did not stay the year out during the for part  of winter I split my instep open with an ax which lamed me for abot nine months My Brother  Thompson took my place and worked my time out also one year for himself. I remained at  home untill the spring of 1825 when I started from home on horseback to go some 10 miles to engage to work  for a man a year upon a farm but before I arived there my horse run away with me & flung me among  some Rocks & broke one of my legs twice in two & put out both Ancles in a shocking manner as recorded in  the Chapter of incidents. this confined me to the House near two months. the first time that I walked half a  mile I went to attend the funeral of two men one by the name of Bird who was murdered by a crazy man named Roe He  split open Birds Head with an ax and laid his brains bare & cut his throat from ear to ear, and the other mans name  was Bodwell a promising young man who was shot dedad the night after the murder by one of his companions under  the following circumstances word was given out to take Row either Dead or alive & about 500 men went out into  the Mountains Hills vallies & the whole country was guarded as the Murderer had hid himself up, they went out 3 or 4 in  company and Roe had a plad cloak on & Mr Bodwell put on the same kind of a cloak to go out to guard through  the night, his uncle strongly urged him not to wear the cloak as it might endanger his life. but He thinking   there would be no danger wore it & during the evening while approching another company a young man by the  name of Gager seeing a man by the name of Gager with a cloak on he thinking that it might be Roe  He hailed him with the countersign & recieved no answer He then leveled his gun & fired & shot Bodwell  dead he spoke a few moments & expired I saw the corpses of these men it was the first body which had ben  murdered that I had ever seen. Roe was finally taken & tryed acquitted upon the plea of insanity but  put into the insane assylum Gager was tryed for manslaughter, but forfeited & paid his bond rather than run the  risk of being found guilty. I remained at home with my Father untill Aprill 1826 at work in the mill I attended  school during the past winter being 18 years of age. In April 1826 I went to live with widow Deming in  the east part of Northington, I staid with her and labored upon her farm for nine mionths I then returned  home to my Fathers House and assisted him in his mills. I remained with him untill April 1827 at which  time I left home & went to live with My Fathers Sister Aunt Hellen Wheeler I took her Flouring Mill  and tended it upon shares in East Avon I never again returned to my Fathers House to live with him I  ownly called as a visitor I was always made welcome at my Fathers House by each member of it this was an  important period in my feelings to leave my Fathers roof to step forth upon the stage of life to act for myself  to be my own councellor & form my own caracter in the open broad world filled my mind with serious reflection  as I wanded my way from my Fathers Roof it created in my mind an anxiety which was more paneful than Joyous 
 I was twenty years of age when I left my Fathers Family & commenced business with aunt Wheeler I  remained with her for three years which brought me to 1830. I had the following reflections on leaving my  Fathers house. -[should I outlive my Parents how long will it be before I shall follow them to the grave and the places  which now know them will know them no more & it will be said of them they have gone the way of all the Earth and  their children while filling their places are following them into the same Eternal world. I am now twenty years of   age & leaving my Fathers house this is an important period & step in my life & in the life of Evry man for at this  age generally speaking evry man forms a character both for time and Eternity. The character principles & sentiments  which are formed from the age of Eightteen to twenty five are generall so deeply planted in the heart that they  controll their future lives & remain with them through life whether they be good or evil. and I felt to say how  cautious I ought to be how I pass this link in the chain of my existance I felt that I needed caution prudence  circumspection & wisdom to guide my Footsteps as I step forth to act for myself. I reflected upon the days of  my youth which were gone & the speed of time which had flown like an arrow to return no more forever, while  walkeing in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither can we spend twice the same time  then how ought we to prize the golden moments of time & measure it out with our talents to the honor  & glory of God & for the salvation of our souls so that when the Lord comes he may recieve his own  with usury. In trying to comprehend the fleetness of time I asked myself the question whare is the old world  whare are the Prophets & Apostles whare are the millions of the inhabitants of the Earth including my Father  & whare are the days of my youth, gone, gone, all gone into the boundless ocean of Eternity whare  I shall soon find myself]-    During the 3 years which I spent with Aunt Wheeler I passed through quite a school of experiences  both temporal & spiritual. The class of associates which I made choice of on ariving at my new  home were young men of the first respectibility in the place yet none of us professed to be guided  wholey by religious principles Hence we occasionally mingled in parties of pleasure, the Ball room & in  several instances I took a hand at a game of cards yet I had many fears about taking this step or  mingling with men who would engage in this dangerous vice yet they were all young men who stood  high in the estimation of their friends & the world, but the influence of such men whare it is bad is   the most to be dreaded of any on Earth. becaus the example of the vulgar & disipated will not have  much influence over the man who intends to maintain a fair standing in society while at the same  time he might yield to the influence of respectable men in society even to do wrong even to that degree that  before he is aware of it that he finds that he has sacraficed his time, talents & property for that which  has done him no good, but brought upon him sorrow, disgrace, misery, & sore repentance & in many instances  when it is to late to redeem himself. But I felt that the hand of the Lord was over me in this thing as well as in  evry thing Els for whenever I have yeielded to the enticement of my associats to stake any thing at the card table  I had the good fortune in almost evry instance to loose it. I did not however loose but a small amount in  this way untill I made a strong resolution that I would entirely forsake this vice if no other before I gained  much of a taste or desire for it which resolution I have always kept. There was a spirit at work with me  in all recreation the card table, ball room, or any party of pleasure that drew my mind away I took no pleasure  in those things whatever my anticipations were they all fled when I arived at the spot I seemed to be as a   spekled birds in the midst of my associates they all seemed to enjoy themselves except me. I at times   wondered why it was so, but I have since learned there was nothing there which fed the immortal  mind. Before I commenced doing business for myself I had not acquired much taste for reading with  the intention of obtaining solid information from books neither had I improved my time in school as I ought to have 
 done and I now found that I had several leasure hours each day & I felt satisfyed that it was not my duty  to squander away this leasure time but the question arose in my mind what I should do with  it. I did not like novel reading because it was a fiction & did not store the mind with truth or knowledge  as for history I had not acquired a tast for that not having read it. & while reading a school Book I  found the following true remark "He that will spend his life in that manner which is most excell-  ent will find that custom will render it most delightsome." It made a strong impression upon my  mind so I immediately commenced to spend my leasure hours the first year in reading history but the greatest  difficulty with me was I read a great deal more than I could digest, remember or profit by I soon found I gained  a taste for reading History I obtained an interest in ^it^ which grew upon me. While perusing History we hold  convers with men of Judgement wisdom & knowledge & by persueing this course we can lay up an extensive  fund of valuable information. I commenced by reading the History of the United States; of England, Scotland,  Greece, Rome, Rollins Ancient History, Josephus and others which I took much interest in and finally I took  hold of the Bible for History And I never have found as interesting a history as the Bible while reading that  Book we convers as it were with the Lord & with the Prophets & Apostles of God & while studying the  word of God we learn thruths which cannot be obtained from any other source & those Books which  contain the revelations of Heaven are of far more interest than those books containing alone the opinions  theories & doctrins of man.    While living with Aunt Wheeler or during the first year of my stay  with her I passed through anoth scene of a revival of religion among the Prysbetarians who were the prevailing  religion of that place I listened the teachings of Elder Kellogg the minister of the place & attended the  meetings of the people But the teachings & principle were not such as I believed in or such as I believed  should belong to the Church of Christ, & I do not think that I obtained any special benefit during  this religious Excitement. In the midst of it I was called to follow my Brother Philo to the grave which   caused me sorrow for a season He was taken suddenly Ill & after a few days illness a Physican was employed  & ordered him strong doses of Calchicum which was poison & he died the 2nd soon after swallowing the second  dose I accidentally herd of his sickness & went home to see him I spent a few moments in conversing with  him he seemed comfortable, I lay down to rest a short time with the intention of setting up with him the  latter part of the night I had not lain long before his Mother said to me Philo was in a fit I arose  walked to his bed side & saw that He was dead I immediately called the Physician who gave him the medicine  he looked at him & turned away much agitated I considered him poisoned to death He diaed Nov 25 1827  He had a dream a few month before which troubled his mind much. He dreamed there was a Angel  arived from Heaven & was going through the streets with a roll containing a list of the Deaths of the people  in that Town during that year And the Angel approached him & unrolled his list & told him  that there would be funeral attended at his Fathers House on the 27th of Nov He recorded it in his  Journal & on that vary day he was buried himself.    Soon after I was called to set up for the night  with the corps of a young man by the name of Henry Miller who was vary wicked & profane He  had been the day before to a celebration of the 4th of July & his Father was a religious man & reproved  him for his Profanity & wickedness, & while going into the Field to get up some Hay their came up   a sudden thunder shower. & Heanry mocked God & the thunder & in a moment he was struct dead  standing near his Father I attended his Father funeral & it made a deep impression upon my mind  I remained with Aunt Wheeler during 3 year & 10 days but I lost a good share of my wages by loaning my money  to an unprincipled young man by the name of Wm Sage & Joining my Brother Azmon in Fitting out Ezra Hart  on a padling expedition he turned crazy & lost nearly all we sent out by him I left Aunt Wheelers Family 
 On the 10 day of April 1830 with the feelings of Friendship & good will to wards her & her Household    Up to this period I have spent my life a little like a ship tosted upon the waves of the sea up & dow^n^ unstable  & unsettelled in my mind, at times triying to worship the Lord & living thate life of a christian & then at other times  giving it up & trying to take pleasure in the the things of the world, but in the midst of it all there seemed to  be an unseen hand guiding my destiny. I had now arived at 23 years of age and I sensibly realized &   deeply Felt that my youth had gone to return no more forever to me, and I felt that I had spent a good deal   of my time in a manner that was not profitable to me not that I had been guilty of committing any Heinous  or outbreaking sins such as Murder, theft, Adultary, Fornications or Blasphamies, yet I hagd a good deal   of my youth in vanity & folly giving way at times to many idle words and vain and foolish recreations  which did not store the mind with knowledge or produce any profitable fruit. At this time I reflected  deeply upon the past & I became thoroughly convinced that there was no real peace or Enjoyment in any  thing except in the servitce of God or in those things which the Lord would Approbate. And I came to a  determined firm resolution in my own mind that from this time henceforth & forever I would seek  the Lord with all my heart, I would seek to know his will by faith, Prayer, & the reading of the  word of God, and I was determined to follow the dictation of the Holy spirit and do the will of God as  far as I could learn it. I brought before my mind in my meditation all the honor, glory & happiness of  the whole world as far as I could grasp in my imagination I placed before my mind the gold & wealth  of the miser. The glory grandure & power of Monarchs, kings, Princes Presidents & Rulers. The military  Renown of Allexander Napoleon & other Military Generals. I cast my mind through the innumerable paths  through which the giddy world travel in search of pleasure happiness, & Joy, and in suming the whole matter  up in the vision of my mind I had to exclaim with Solomon that it was all "vanity of vanities, or all is vanity  saith the preacher" I could see that it would all find one common grave in a few short days and I was  thoroughly convinced that no man could enjoy true happiness & peace & obtain that which would feed  the immortal mind. Except God was his friend, and Jesus Christ his Advocate, & he done their will & kept  their commands. Upon this ground I felt determined to stand & spend my future life.    I made an ingagement with Mr Samuel Collins of Collinsville Cdt (the manufactrurer of the Collinses  axes) to attend his Flouring Mill I commenced work for Mr Samuel Collins on the 14th day of  May 1830th. I commenced boarding with a company of about 30 men, mostly young men but they  being of a vain worldly turn of mind I did not enjoy myself in their company and I change my  boarding place took up my residence in a private family by the name of Dudly D. Sacket.  About this time a Reformation broke out in Farmington Connecticut mostly conducted by  the Methodist denomination My younger brother Asahel H. Woodruff made a profession  of Religion and seemed to be vary much ingaged in the cause which was a great consolation  to me I attended there meetings and felt to regoicede to see my brother so much ingaged in  trying to serve the Lord & acting up to the best light he had. I had a great Desire to do the  will of God & to know what to do to be saved I prayed night & day as I had an oppertunity  & the Lord Blessed me with much of his Holy Spirit and I was happy, all things to me seemed  to praise the Lord the soon [sun], Moon & stars, sky, air land and water, Montains Hills rocks & Dales, forests  groves meadows & grain all things seemed to praise the Lord. it began to me to be the Hapiest period of   my life. I had often herd those feelings expressed by individuals but to me it was a blind story untill  now. My Feelings brought plainly to my mind the words of the SlPsalmest David whare he plainly expresses 
 his feelings upon this subject when he called upon the Rocks, woods, Mountains, & hills to Praise the Lord He  calls upon the waves of the sea to praise their God "He says the Mountains skiped like rams & the Little  Hills like lambs. He exclaimed what ailed theeye ye mountains that ye skiped like rams & ye little Hills like  lambs.["] [##Psalm 114:4-6##] now my impression is that the mountains did not move but it was the feelings of the Psalmest he was filled  with such a sense of the Love of God & that these theings were the work of his hands & that God was in them &  that they were praiseing him, this feelings is enjoyed more or less at times by all who are governed and  controlled by the Holy spirit. I felt to resolve more and more that I would spend my whole life in the service  of the Lord. My work was very light in the Mill and I had much leasure time for reading, meditation  & prayer and I began to read the bible with a more prayerful attention than ever before in my life and  I found it to be a new book to me it contained truths of the most glorious & sublime nature if I wish for  History I could find it there. If I was cast down or tried or tempted I there found a remidy in con-  nextion with the spirit of God. The Lord is the author of the Book and his promises swep away the darkness  from my mind. The more I prayed & searched the word of God the more I felt my own weekness & dependence  upon the Lord. I felt to pray that the Lord would enlighten my my mind, enlarge my heart & give me wisdom  & understanding.    The reformation continued in Farmington, and a number of my relatives  were deeply ingaged in the service of the Lord according to the best light they have among whom was uncle  Ozen Woodruff & his wife Hannah Woodruff unto whom I have been much attached all my life having lived a  good deal with them during my early life I attended meetings freequently with them and Enjoyed  myself much in their society    There was an Island but a short distance from the Mill the center of which was an ^open^ level field  covered with wildflowers of various kinds, the Island was surrounded with a rapid current of water, dashing  over rock, the banks of which were thickly studied with tall waving pines. I chose this Island day &   night as my place of retirement for prayer, praise & meditation before the Lord I spent many a midnight  hour alone upon that Island in prayer before the Lord, and the many happy hours in sweet meditation  which I spent in my lonely walks upon that Plesant retreat I shall never forget in time. The words   of Robert Pollock in one of his poems often came to my mind while sitting alone in that solitary place  where He says "In the wide desert where the view was large,   "Plesant were many scenes but most to me,    "The solitude of vast extant, untouched by hand of art,   "Whose natured sowed herself, and reaped her crops.  "Whose garments were the clouds, whose minstrels Brooks,  "Whose lamps the Moon & stars, whose organ choir the voice of many waters,   "whose banquits the falling deesws, whose heroes storms,   "whose warriors mighty winds, whose lovers flowers,  "Whose orators the thunderbolts of God,  "Whose palaces the Everlasting hills,  "Whose ceiling heavens unfathomable blue,  "And from whose rocky turrets batteled high,  "Prospects immens spread out on all sides in air,  "Lost now between the walk in and the main,  "Now walked with hills that slept above the storm    The roaring waters, the waving pines, giving room to the passing winds, the field of flowers crusted with   the silver rays of the moon, being all open to the eye and ear while the curtain of heaven clo decked with the stars  and moon mingling with the survey. These things resting upon my mind as the handy work of God in connextion  with prayer & meditation accompanied by the Holy spirit, gave unto me peculiar charm, sensation Joy & happiness  which I had never before enjoyed & experienced in my life. The Lord Blessed me with joy happiness & consolation  becaus I was acting up to the best light and knowledge I had, and when a man will do that in any age of the world  I am satisfied the Lord will bless him. I had no Peter, or Apostle, or any man who held the holy Priesthood to lead me  or teach me the way to be saved. So I had to do the waybest way I could. I got up prayer meetings in our village & prayed 
 for light and knowledge. I attended a methodist camp meeting in Farmington Ct. with many of my relatives &  friends and had an interesting time. I now searched the bibles & prayed earnestly to know what duties I should   perform in order to be saved & I called upon the Lord & prayed unto the Lord to guide me in all things both  temporal & spiritual & the Lord did manifest many things unto me & heard and answered my prayers   yet I felt that I needed a teacher & leader in the things of God I had a Desire to attend to the ordinances   of the gospel yet I did not feel disposed to Join any religious sect or church that I was acquainted  with because I could not see the organization with any sect on earth that was manifest in the days of the prophets  & Christ and the Apostles. yet I could see that Baptism by immersion was a commandment of God &  I had a Desire to be baptized and not understanding any thing about the Priesthood or the Authority  to administer in the ordinances of the Gospel I applyed to a Baptist minister to Baptize me I told him  at the same time that I did not wish to Join his church & gave him my reasons that I did not consider the  organization according to the pattern of the Apostolic Church Mr George Phippen was the name of the  Baptist Minister at first refused to Baptize me saying that it was against there rules to Baptize any one  except he joined there church, but after conversing with him several times upon the subject he said  he would baptize me. So upon the 5th day of March 1831, on Saturday Mr Phippen Preached a discourse in  Farmington upon the subject of Baptism & then went to Farmington River accompanied by a large congregation  and Baptized myself & my Brother Asahel and we went our way rejoiceing thinking we had done  the will of God. this is the ownly Gospel ordinance I attempted to attend to untill I joined the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints hands was not laid upon me for the Holy Ghost for it was not practiced  but I had peace of mind because I acted up to the best light I had at the time.    I did not remain with Mr Collins quite one year he wished to remove his Mill as he wished the water privilege  for other purposes so I settelled up my business with him & Engaged to tend the Flowuring mill to Mr Richard  B. Cowles of New Hartford Ct. when I settled with Mr Collins he gave me a strong invitation to come and  labour for him should I wish a place & proffered to give me any recommends I should ask. I parted with  him and his Clerk John Barlow and with all my acquaintances in that place with the Best of Feelings and I felt  that I was leaving a place whare I had spent many a pleasing & happy hour, after spending a few days in  visiting my Friends I went to New Hartford & commenced business for Mr Cowles on the 20 day of March 1831  I spent one year with Mr Cowles During my stay there I attended meetings with the various denominations of the place I also held  meetings with the young people I found several persons with whom my spirit was congenial with my feelings among whom  was two men by the name of Lyman & Buel there feelings & views were in a measure similar to my own  we visited each other much & prayed together often & spent many a good hour together in prayer & conversing  upon the things of God. there were several protracted meetings in the Town while I was there I freequently  attended & several ministers asked me to Join their churches I would ask them if they had the faith that was  once delivered to the saints, if they laid hands upon the sick & had dreams Revelations & visions as did the Ancient  Saints & if they had Prophets and Apostles they would say no these are not needed now they are done away so  I could not believe as they did so I did not Join any church but I gave myself constantly to Prayer reading  the Bible, & meditation and I called upon the Lord Earnestly to lead and guide me I spent many hours in the  woods among the Rocks & in the mill at midnight calling upon the Lord to teach me what to do I finally made  the following prayer & petition unto the Lord with a determination to ask untill I obtained an answer "O Lord  are the priest & People who profess they name and who appear zealous in thy cause by holding many meetings  & call upon they name with a loud voice & who labour hard to make many proseliytes are they they people are  they & their works excepted at thine hand. if so O Lord why am I separated from them in spirit 
 why cannot I feel at home with them & worship with them why am I left alone like a speckled bird of the  forest why do they oppose me in those things which the spirit & word of God teach me is true. And again  if they are not the people of God and are not excepted of thee why do they prosper why do they gather  many souls unto there churches who appear cincere. And if they are not the people of the Lord where  shall I find they people O Lord show me these things and teach me what to do and I covenant to  obey thy voice and do thy will, and after praying earnestly onto the Lord with this prayer on a  certain night in my mill untill after midnight the spirit of the Lord rested upon me & the voice of  the spirit of the Lord said unto me go to my word & I will there show thee my will and answer  thy prayer. I opened the Bible promiscously praying the Lord in my heart to direct my mind to  that portion of his word which would answer my prayes & show me the truth and I opened to the  LVI Chapter of Isaiah which I read and was satisfied that it was in answer to my prayer. I was satisfied  the salvation of God was abot to be revealed and his righteousness to come forth I was also satisfied that I should  live to see the people of God gathered, and I should be with them and that I should have a name & a place  in the House of God with his sons and Daughters, and I felt that I ought not any more to say that I was  utterly seperated from the people of God. I aslso believed that the priests of the day were in great measure like  the shepherds described in that chapter that they were ignorant and did not understand, and that they all looked  for their gain from there quarter and that they were not satisfied and were like greedy dogs who could never  have enough. from that hour I was satisfyed to remain as I was untill I should find the people of God which I  looked for in faith and believed I should know them when I saw them. I had no one to lead or guide me in the  way of the Lord except the spirit and word of God, these I tried to cling unto. My mind abut this time was  deeply exercised upon one principle and that was Keeping the seventh day of the week for the sabbath in[stead]  of the first day I found that the seventh day was esstablished by the Lord himself as the sabbath day  and all Israel was commanded to keep it as the sabbath day forever throughout there generation &  I could never find where the Lord ever changed the sabbath day. Jesus & the Apostles kept the seventh  day of the week as do all the Jews up to the present time and my mind was troubled upon this subject  and I was never satisifyed in my mind upon the subject untill I promised the Lord that I would keep that  day for the sabbath as soon as I was liberated from the gentile yoke so that I could. During the spring of 1832  while at Mr Cowles I read a short article in a News Paper stating that there was a New sect rising up that  were called Mormons that professed to have the ancient gifts of the gospel they healed the sick, cast out devils  spoke in tongues and performed miracles as the Apostles did and that they were going up to Missouri to a place  they called Zion and that they had got a New Book called the Book of Mormon which was revealed  to them by an angel of God. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] The Editor of the paper ridiculed the people I heard there was one of the Books  in Barkhampstead 10 miles distant from me I felt very anxious to obtain it to read but I did not get an  oppertunity. I said when I saw the article and read it that I did not care what was said about   the people if they really had the gifts which the Ancient Saints possessed it was all I would ask, they  were the very people which I was looking for.    I settelled up my business with Mr Cowles in  an Amicable manner although he wished me to remain with him yet I had made up my mind to go to the  Western Country to purchase a farm. for about 2 weeks previous to leaving him my mind was deeply  exercised upon the subject of going to Rhode Island the spirit that was upon me day and night said  go to Rhode Island. I called upon my Brother Azmon's to stop with him untill we should start for the  west. as soon as the salutation was past I said to him I wondered what the Lord wanted of me in  Rhode Island for the spirit of the Lord had rested upon me for 2 weeks & said to me go to Rhode Island 
 In about one ^hour^ after this my Brother Asahel also arived upon a visit and after shaking hands almost  the first words which he spoke was I wonder what the Lord wants of me in Rhode Island for the  spirit of the Lord has been upon me for two or three weeks and told me to go to Rhode Island this caused  us to marvel as we had not spoken to each other or seen each other for several months I felt convinced it  was our duty to go there yet we could not tell what it meant. But Brother Azmon thought that as  we were about prepareing to go to the west we had Better omit it & I reluctantly consented to it. Subsequently I  learned that at that vary time Elders Orson Hyde & Samuel H Smith was preaching the gospel in that state  and had we have gone we should certainly have embraced the work & Joined the Latter Day Saints  for we were prepared in our minds to have received the truth at that time But like Jonah who was  sent to Nineveh went to Tarshish so I insted of going to Rhode Island Prepaired myself & went to  western New York. Brother Azmon & myself took each of us a tin trunk with some goods & $800  dollars in Monney and started for the west in the spring of 1832 we called upon Father Woodruff  at Colebrook Ct whare he had moved a short time previous to attend the flouring Mill of Mr Sage  we spent a day or two at Fathers House then went on our Journey for the west not knowing whare  we should go we finally wandered about through the western part of New York finally went north  of Sarycuse into the Town of Richland Oswego County & called upon a man by the name of Constant  Souls & we purchased his Farm of him containing 140 Acres of land a saw mill good Dwelling House Barn  & orchard for $1800. We Paid down $800, & the remainder afterwards. I made it my home with Mr  Souls and Azmon returned to Connecticut for his Family He soon returned & we commenced farming & fencing  & lumbering which business we followed together untill the spring of 1834. As soon as I commenced doing business  for myself I commenced keeping satrurday the seventh day of the week for the sabbath as did my Brother   Azmon. we held meetings upon the seventh day and several others in the neighborhood attended the  meetings with us and kept the same day of the week for the sabbath I also attended with the various  donominations that were around us freequently. My Brother Azmon had been a vary peculiar person  from his childhood up He had been vary strict to his bible, his prayers & to his God. He prayed much  from his childhood & had much of the spirit of the Lord & had much light & I was much edifyed &   interested with his teaching & conversation He would never employ a physician when sick but always  trust in the Lord we were in Richland when the cholera first made its appearance into the United States via carrier  into Sackets Harbor. My Brother Azmon had a severe attack of the cholera in the fall of 1833 I laid hands  upon his head with his wife according to his request & prayed for him and Asked the Lord in the name of   Jesus Christ to rebuke his desease & command it to Depart from him & the cholera was stayed from the hour  and in the morning He was able to walk about & He immediately recovered. this had always been his faith  from his youth up He had been through some severe fits of sickness but would not empl[o]y any medical aid  but always trusted in God, believing it was his privilege to be healed by the prayer of faith and the laying on  of hands as it was in Ancient days this was the state of mind we were both in when the fulness of the gospel  reached us by an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. we were looking to find a people  who would build up the Chirsturch of Christ according to the Ancient Pattern. Thus I have given a Brief synopsis  of my life & experience up to the time of my Embracing the fulness of the gospel & Joining the Latter day Saints which  event was one of Great Joy to me which laid the foundation of a greater & more glorious work then  ever I expected to see in this life & I Pray God in the name of Jesus Christ to guide my future life  that I may live to his honor & glory & be a benefit to my Fellow man and at last be saved in his  Celestial Kingdom even so Amen 
 CHAPTER IV.    My first hearing and embraceing the fulness of the Everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by  the Latter Day Saints. My Journey to Kirtland Ohio. My first interview with the Prophet Joseph    On the 29th day of Dec 1833 Elder Zerah Pulsipher & Brother Cheny called at my House &  wished to hold a meeting in the neighborhood I and Brother Azmon were absent from Home My Brothers  wife informed them that we would light wish to hear them Accordingly they gave out an appointment for  preaching in the school house that evening when I arived home my sister in law informed me that there  would be a mormon meeting in the school House that evening. I immediately turned out my horses & without waiting  to eat my supper started for the school House I prayed all the way in my heart that the Lord would open my understa-  nding & give me his spirit and if they were men of God & had the truth I prayed that I might receive it I arived at  the school House in this frame of mind without any prejudice in my heart and when I arived the House  was crouded full I went alone my Brother Azmon had gone before me I crouded my way through the Assembly  and got upon one of the writing desks whare I could see Brother Pulsipher opened the meeting by Prayer He  knelt down and asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ for what He wanted his manner of praying  struck me vary forcibly & I felt the spirit of God bear testimony that He was a servant of God He arose & sung  then He preached to the People about one hour & a half & the spirit of God rested upon him He bore a strong testimony  of the truth of the gospel which he preached & of the truth of the Book of Mormon which he said was Delivered  to Joseph Smith by an Angel out of Heaven. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] the spirit of the Lord bore a strong testimony to me that what  he said was true. I believed it when he closed He was followed by Brother Cheney who bore testimony  that what had been said was true Brother Pulsipher then gave liberty to any one in the congregation to  make any remarks either for or against what had been said. And almost instantly I found myself  upon my feet without any intention upon my part of speaking but when I founed myself upon my  feet I felt urged by the spirit to bear testimony to the truth of what I had heard so I exhorted my neighbors  & friends to be careful what they done as touching those moen not to oppose them for they were the servants  of God & had preached the pure gospel of Jesus Christ unto us this night & I warn you in the name of the Lord not  to oppose them but to search the scriptures diligently to see if those things are so. when I closed my Brother Azmon  arose & also bore testimony to the truth of the work & he was followed by several others at the close of the  meeting I went to the Brethren and asked them to go home with me they did & we had a good deal of conversation  with them. I took the Book of Mormon & went to reading it & the spirit of God bore testimony to me that the  Book was true I believed it we sat up till a late hour. I felt to open my Eyes to see, my Ears to hear, & my heart  to understand, & my Doors to entertain the servants of God.    30th I arose in the morning reflecting upon the gospel  which I had heard the day before I felt it my duty to offer myself for Baptism. Brother Azmon also felt the  the same we told Brother Pulsipher that we wished to be baptized He appointed the next to Baptize us during  the day he called upon Elder Holton a preacher of the Free will Baptist denomination He had a Daughter lay  vary sick & he wished Brother Pulsipher to lay hands upon her & he promised the Lord that if she was healed  he would go foreward & be baptized. Hands was laid upon her & she was healed. also another young woman I spent  a good Deal of the time through the day & night in reading the Book of Mormon & conversing with the Brethren I became  more & more convinced of the truth of the work. Dec 31st 1833. At 11 oclok A.M. there was quite a congregation  of People gathered together at the water and I went forth with My Brother Azmon & the two young women who were 
 healed the day before & we were baptized for the remission of our sins By Brother Zera Pulsipher an Elder in the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the snow was about 3 feet deep a cold day & the water mixed with snow & Ice  yet I did not feel cold Brother Pulsipher Appointed a meeting at candle light to attend to our confermation  a large assembly came to gether and they brought a good deal of the spirit of opposition with them Brother  Pulsipher spoke upon the principle of Latter Day Saints laying on of hands He then laid hands upon sus & con-  firmed us as members of the Church there was a good Deal of Darkness in the room untill the congregation  dispersed they took away the darkness with them & the Holy Ghost fell upon us & we rejoiced greatly.    Jan 1st 1834 Elder Noah Holton had covenanted with the Lord to obey the gospel if his child was Healed  which was the case, but he had not obeyed, & Brother Azmon called upon him this morning & told him in   the name of the Lord that if he did not go forth & obey his covenant with the Lord by being Baptized the Lord  would curse him He recieved the warning & went for the with several others & was Baptized this day    2nd Elder Pulsipher called all together to day who had been baptized under his hands and organized us into  a Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints containing 12 members. He ordained my Brother  Azmon Woodruff & Noah Holton to the office of Elders & myself a Teacher & I felt that I could truly  exclaim with the prophet of God that it was better to be a door keeper in the House of God than to dwell in the tents of  wickedness. I felt much of the spirit of God resting upon me & bearing testimony to the truth of the Book  of Mormon The license which I received reads as follows    (A Power & Authority given to Wilford Woodruff proving that he is a teacher in the Church of Christ by  the will of God the Father according to his Holy calling & the gift & power of the Holy Ghost agreeable to the  Revelations of Jesus Christ signifying that He has been baptized and received into the Church according to the   Articles & Covenants of the same and ordained under the Hands of Zerah Pulsipher given at Richland  Oswego County N. Y. Jan 2nd 1834 Zerah Pulsipher.) I continued with my Brother in Richland  through the months of Jan, Feb & March labouring with the Church we had considerable opposition from the  Priest & people yet inasmuch as we were humble the Lord ever Delivered us. I walked 65 miles in company  with Brother Hoton to attend an evening meeting with Brother Pulsipher & a few other saints at Brother Newcome  House in Fabeus when we arived we held several meetings & spent several Days with them the spirit of the Lord was  with us & we had a good time & were much edefyed and we returned home rejoiceing. We were soon visited by  Elder Harry Brown & Priest James Blakesley who held two meetings with us & we were much interested. we were  not visited any more untill about the 1st of April at which time Brother Harry Brown returned accompanied  by Elder Parley P. Pratt the first time I had ever seen him. we appointed a meeting for him he met with our  little branch and we had a precious time with him He spoke till near midnight He was upon an important  misshion He in company with Lyman Wight was under a commandment of the Lord to gather together the servants  of the Lord His young men & warriors to go up & redeem Zion it was the will of the Lord that they should gather  to gether 500 men but not to return less than 100. it was the will of the Lord that the young men & middle aged should go  up to Zion all that could be spared I told Brother Parley my circumstances He told me it was duty to try  & prepare myself to go up to the Land of Zion and Accordingly I used every exertion to settle my business   and arange my affairs aso as to go up to Missouri in the spring I went north to Jefferson County with Brother  Pratt & Brown & heard Brother Pratt preach several times which strengthened me much in the gospel of  Christ I returned home in Few days & laboured diligently to settle all my accounts so as to be ready to start  for Kirtland in the spring & on the 10th April 1834 Brother Harry Brown & Warran Ingles called at my house  to accompany me on my Journey they remained with us untill the following day. Then on the 11th day of  April 1834 after prepareing my Horses & waggon I took the parting hand with My Brother Azmon & his 
 wife & children & the Brethren sisters & neighbors in that place & we commenced our Journey for kirtland  Ohio whare all the brethren were to meet who were going to Missouri the time of meeting was the first day  of May so all the Brethren could be together according to the word of the Lord. Many of my Neighbors called  to see me & urged me not to go said that I should get killed I told them I had no fears of being killed and  I was I should go for the Lord had commanded it we called upon the Saints at Lyons & spent the first sabbath  with them. And the next sabbath we spent with the Brethren in Genese co. We also called upon Brother  MCWithy & spent the night with him we also called upon Brother Lewis we found Brother John Murdock there  and also Orson Pratt this was the first time I had seen those brethren we spent the sabbath with them &  heard them both Preach & on monday continued our Journey for Kirtland accompanied by Brothers Pratt  & Murdock. Brother Ingels & myself called upon Brother Strong at Tompson & spent the night with  him. I was much Edifyed with his conversation. He showed a draft of a city which he called  Zion which he held in his possession. We arived in the Town of Kirtland on the night of the 25th  of April 1834. There for the first time in my life I had an interview with our Beloved Brother  Joseph Smith the Prophet Seer & Revelator whom God has raised up in these last day to esstablish  his Church & kingdom in the Last days & to bring forth Revelation unto the children of man this  was the most important event of my life as far as my feelings were concerned Although my  first introductions to him was of that Nature that might have been calculated to have tried the feelings & faith  of some men whato had formed in there own mind how a Prophet would look & act for when I first saw  him & his Brother Hiram they were shooting at a mark with a brace of Pistols when they stoped shooting  I was introduced to them Brother Joseph shook hands Hartily with me & invited me to go to his house &  make his habitation my home while I stayed in Kirtland I gladly excepted the invitation & went home  in a few moments he brought into the room a wolf skin & said come Brother Woodruff I want you to  help me tan this wolf skin as I want to put it on my seat while I go my Journey to the west so I pulled  off my coat rolled up my sleeves & went at it & soon taned it over a chair post. while employed at  this I smiled at the appearance of my first labour with the prophet but during the evening He was conversing about  the camps going to Zion. He was filled with the spirit of the Lord He smote upon his breast and said I would  to God I could unbosom my feelings in the House of my Friends Among his remarks in the evening He  said dont be discouraged Brethren about our not having means to go to Zion will the Lord will provide  means & He will put it into the Heart of somebody to send me some money. next day he received a Letter  from Sister Vose containing $150. when He opened the Letter & took out the money He exclaimed see here did  I not tell you last evening that the Lord would send me some money to help us on our Journey here it is  I was perfectly satisfyed that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I here became acquainted with   Many of the Brethren who were going in the camp of Zion & with the High Priest & Elder & private members of  the Church who were living in Kirtland among whom was the Smith family Cowdry, Rigdon, Brigham Young  & his Fathers Family Orson Hyde Milton Holmes & many others. On the 27 of April being Sunday I attended  meeting and heard many of the Elders preach & testify among whom was Sidney Rigdon, Orson Hyde, ^&^ Orson  Pratt. ^Hyrum Smith Oliver Cowdry & Joseph Smith^ it appeared to me there was more light, knowledge, truth, & good sense made manifest in that meeting  respecting the gospel & kingdom of God than I had ever received from the whole sectarian wourld during ^my^ life  I rejoiced much in being made acquainted with a Prophet of God & the Saints of God I felt that it was  in fulfillment of the promises of God to me in former days it was what my soul had desired for  many years And I had now found the people, Church, & kingdom of God And I was satisfied  And I felt to Praise the name of the Lord with evry feeling of my whole soul

The whole country now was in the midst  of Great excitement the inhabitants of Jackson County who had previously driven our people out of   there county were now swareing vengance upon our heads & trying to stir up the feelings of the people  in Clay County against us the judgments of God fell suddenly upon some of the leaders of the mob  in Jackson County & they were drowned in the Missouri River while crossing in a ferry boat  & the buzzards eat the flesh off there bones. A Rumour reached us that the people of Richmond  would not let us pass through there town But in the morning of the 19th we went through vary   quietly before the people were up no one attempted to disturb us & we intended to go to Clay  County that day but the Lord knew best what was for our good & he began to harden our progress  soon one wheel broke down & another run of & one thing followed another to hinder us so that  we did not travel ownly betwen the 2 forks of the fishing river we camped upon an Elevated  peace of Ground having traveled ownly about 15 miles. Fishing river at this point was composed  of seven small streams & those betwen which we had camped were two of them. As we halted and  were makeing preparation for the night five men armed with guns rode into our camp & told us we   see Hell enough before morning and there accompaning oath partook of all the malace of Demands they told  us of the various companies of men forming to come against us to night. 60 from Richmond 70 from  Clay 200 from Jackson &c all had sworn to destroy us. the weather was pleasant at this time all was  calm & sereane but as soon as the men left the camp there was a small cloud as big as a mans  hand seen & it soon began to spread with great rapidity & in a few moments the whole Heavens gathered  blackness & a mightly storm burst with fury upon the Heads of our Enemies the storm tremendious  the wind Hail & rain & thunder met our Enemies in great wrath & soon softened their direful  courage and frustrated all their plans to "kill Joe Smith" & his Armey. Instead of fighting they  crawled into waggons & under them & into Hollow trees one company filled an old shanty & held  the bridles of their Horses betwen the logs of the cabbin till the Horses were so pelted with hail they broke the brid[l]es  across the fingers of their owners & fleed many miles before the storm leaving their riders to suck the Blood 
 off from their peeled fingers while they were swaring that they could not go to fight "Joe Smith but what thare  must be a Hail storm sent or some other Damned damned thin[g] kicked up to stop them["] and after the mob had  had spent that Dreary night in the midst of the pelting storm, all their amunictian wet many of their Horses gone  they were willing to return home & as soon as Arangements could be made this forlorn hope took the back  tract to Jackson County & other places to Joined the main body of mob. "fully satisfyed as were the survivors of   those who were drowned that when Jehovah fights they would rather be absent the gratifycation is too terrible"  There was but little Hail fell in our camp but the rain fall in torents & the wind blew all our tents down but fortunately  we were near an old Baptist meeting house wall [we all] went into that & was comfortable Joseph tried to hold up his tent itill  the groungd was covered with water then He let it blow down & went into the ^House with the^ rest of us & remarked as He came  in "Boys there is a meaning to the storm the Lord has sent this as a Blessing unto us it is for our defense the storm  in camp was but light to what it was around us, for all around for half a mile distant the Hail stones & lumps of Ice  fell in great abundance cut down the crops of corn cut off li[m]bs from the trees, lightnings flashed incessantly  & the roaring of thunder was tremendious. the Earth trembled & quaked it seemed at [as] if the mandates of  vengance had gone forth from the gGod of Battles to protect his servants from the Destruction of their enemies  The little stream that was not more than Ancle Deep at sundown in the morning was about 40 feet deep &  our Enemies swore that the waters rose 30 feet in 30 minuts in Little fishing River. it broke up all  the calculations of the mob about fighting us & they all broke up & went home the best they could  Friday 20th we went 5 miles onto the prairie to procure food for our horses & ourselves & to esstablish ourselves for a short  time so we could Defend ourselves from the wrath of our enemies, and while in this situation on Saturday the  21 Col Sconce with two other Leading men from Richmond Ray County came to see us & wished to know  our intentions. For said He I see there is an Almighty Power that protects this people for I started from  Richmond Ray County with a company of Armed men having a full determination to destroy you but was  kept back from you a tremendious storm. When He entered camp He was seized with a great trembling  & had to sit down & when he had told the object of his visit Joseph arose & addressed them & told  them our sufferings in Jackson County & other places in consequence of our religion & that we had come  1000 miles to bring clothing & other assistance to our persecuted Brethren and after making a lengthy speech  they were melted down & offered him their hands & said they would use their influence to allay the excitement  & would do us what good they could, they wept while Hearing the recital of our persecutions & found that our  intentions wer good, according to there agreement they rode all around among the people & allayed the excitement so that we could  go whare we pleased unmolested. June 22nd Cornelius Gillom the sheriff of Clay County called upon us & wanted to see  Joseph Smith He steped forth & said I am the man the first time He had made himself known to his enemies since He  left Kirtland. He expressed his views concerning us & gave some instruction concerning the manners customs & dispositions of  the people. The Prophet Joseph received a revelation to day on Fishing River Missouri June 22 concerning our camp  excepting our offerings as He did Abrahambs &c it is published in the Church History concerning the Redemption of Zion.  About this time Brothers Thayer & Hayes were attacked with the cholera & Brother Hancock was taken during the storm  Joseph Had previously called the camp to gether & told them that in consequence of Disobedience they of some who were   not willing to listen to his words & carry out his council & had rebelled & said that God had decreed that sickness should  come upon them & they would die like sheep with the rot & warned the camp that they would be visited by sickness  & Judgment he was sorry for it but could not help it.    On the 23rd we started for Liberty Clay County  taking a circuitous course round the Heads of fishing river to avoid the deep water when within 5 or 6 miles of Liberty  we were met by Gen Atchinson & others who desired us not to go to Liberty as the feelings of the people were so much  against us. we then wheeled to the left & crossing the prairie & woodland we came to Sidney Gilberts Residents & 
 and Encamped on the Bank of Rush Creek in Brother Burghates Burgharts field Brother Burghart offered me small  room for me & my company if we would clean it out so we went at it & cleaned it out & spread down our  Blankets we had but Just got it fiixed when the Brethren were attacked with the cholera in camp & they were brough  in & laid side & sid & it was but a short time untill their was near a Dozen laid open our beds as the  prophet had Declaired so it came to pass men fell in camp as though they were struck down  by the Destroying Angel and during the night some of the guard fell to the ground with their gun in hand  at the commencement Brother Joseph laid hands upon those who were seized with it cholera but He quickly  learned by experienced that when the great Jehovah Decreed a Destruction upon any people & made that known man  must not attemp to stay his hand for as soon as he laid hands upon the sick & rebuked the desease it instantly  seized him & came near slaying him. Early in the morning of the 25 the camp was seperated into small  bands & all that had teams was councelled to take them away And as I had a team I made preparations  to leave all were councilled to leave the ground except enough to take care of the sick As Brother Seth  Hitchcock of my company had the cholera we have him his choice of any men in our company to  satay to take care of him He made choice of Warran Ingels Harry Browns Brother in Law He  took his gun & things out of my waggon & went into the room & hung them up & wept because  he had to stop he felt as though he himself would die which afterwards proved to be the case. I rem[ov]ed  my waggon to Brother Lyman Wights with Milton Holmes & Heman Hyde & made it our home  with him we went However to Brother Lowerys House first & spent the first few days with him from there to  Lyman Wights. But while I was there a number of the Brethren among whom was Brigham Young Heber C.  Kimball Orson Pratt Luke Johnson G. A. Smith & others were in the camp of the sick, attending to the sick &  Burying the dead. see Heber C Kimballs Journal & Church History which gives an Account of the same  "The cholera continued its Ravages about 4 days about 68 of the saints suffered from this disease during  which time the following persons died 13 in number John S. Carter, Eber Wilcox, (Seth Hitchcock (from my  company) Erastus Rudd, Algernon Sidney Gilbert, Alfred Frisk, Edward Ives, Noah Johnson  Jesse B Lawson, Robert McCord, Elial Strong, Jesse Smith & Betsey Parrish. When the cholera first  attacked the Brethren John S. Carter was the first man to stretch out his hand to rebuke it & he was instantly  seized with it & the first man that Died about 6 oclok in the afternoon in about 30 minuts after Seth Hitchcock  died. it was impossible to obtain coffins but the Brethren roolled them up in our Blankets which we had spread  down & drew them half a mile & buried them on in the Bank of a small stream which empties into rush creek  the dead was drawn upon an ox stead, while some were diging the graves others stood & guarded  with gun in hand to keep off the Enemy. almost evry man in camp was afflicted with a camp distemper  or diarrhea except myself I was not troubled with it allt all not that I considered myself any better than my Brethren  who had died many of the Brethren were sick night unto death with it among whom were Orson Pratt J. B. Nobles  Z Coulton, G. A. Smith & many others but they practized bathing & baptizing in cold water which   they thought was very Benefitial to them Brother Ingles was attacked with the cholera & died and was  among the Last that were buried. I went down one night to take care of him but he had a watcher so I took  care of Zebedee Coultrin during the night as he had no one with him Brother Joseph was also afflicted  with it for several days. Brother Ingels had been my companion all the way from my home in  Richland while on the Journey after Brother Joseph got better He called the Saints together at Br  Lyman Wights & told them the cholera had been sent according to his prediction & nearly all had  suffered more or less & some 15 had died & he said to the Saints if you will now humble yourselves  before the Lord & covenant to keep his commandments from this time forth I promise you in the name 
 of the Lord that the plague shall be staid from this hour & there shall not be another case of it  and the Brethren covenaneted with uplifted to hands to keep the commands of God & to obey  the council of the prophet & the plage was stayed from that hour there was not another case  of it among the saints. Brother Lyman Wight had taken a Job of work of Col Arthur to make  him 100000 Brick & to build him a House. I commenced work for Brother Wight about the  first of July we first went into Col Arthurs wheat field to help cut his wheat. I found it a great privi-  lege to live with Brother Wight at this time as all the High Priest & High Councils meetings were held in  his house and nearly all the Councils of the Church in Zion were held at his house this gave me a chance to obtain  great light knowledge & instruction which I highly prized. The Prophet Joseph met with all the Authorities o  the Church in that Land & organized the Church in Zion He appointed a presidency of three & a High Council  of twelve men He met with us several times. He met the Authorities at Lyman Wights on the 7th of   July where brother Joseph gave us a great deal of teaching & council while he was clothed upon with much  of the spirit & power of God He taught with regard to the office of the priesthood & administering therein He ordained  David Whitmer President & W. W. Phelps & John Whitmer assistance. He also ordained Twelve Councellors  Father Whitmore came forward & blessed his three sons David, John & Christian Whitmore in the name of the  Lord Also Father Knight Blessed his son Newel. All present voted with uplifted hands to Heaven to sustain  Brother Joseph & allso the Authorities in Zion who had been appiointed & set apart for this purpose to preside over  the Church & Kingdom of God this was the last meeting I ever attended with Joseph Smith in the State of Mo.  I counted it one of the greatest Blessings of my life to have the privileg of travelling in Zions Camp with him  one thousand miles & of hearing his teachings & instruction it was a feast to my soul. He left for Kirtland  with his Brother Hyrum & others on the 9th July. Brother Joseph Advised according to the word of the Lord in  the revelation given that all who could stop in Missouri & not go back should do so. I gave in my name  to tarry so I spent the summer with Brother Wight & worked in company with Milton Holmes Heman   Hyde & others. Brother Joseph returned to me the sword which I had given him & he had carried it all  the way upon his Journey from Kirtland to Missouri so I felt to keep it & preserve it as a relic of  that campaign.    I attended ^meetings^ through the summer we occasionally had preaching from the Elders who  were appointed to teach & evry sabbath we had meetings at Brother Wights & broke bread & exhorted  each other to faithfulness. I also occasionally met with the Teachers Quorum which office I still held  and I enjoyed the meetings well. While at Brother Lyman Wight I wrote a vary lengthy letter to Father Robert  Mason of symnbury Ct. who was called the Prophet Mason & who had taught me from my youth up the gifts &  graces of the gospel. I gave him an account of the rise & progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  the Administration of the Angel the coming forth of the Book of Mormon the order of the Priesthood &c [##Joseph Smith-History 1:30-59##] He received the  Letter Heard it read with Joy several times (He handled the Letter as he did the fruit in the vision.) but he was near  a hundred years old. He soon died & did not live to see an Elder to administer unto him the ordinances of the gospel I  have spoken upon this same subject in my 2nd Chapter.

 Believing it to be the Duty of the Latter Day Saints to consecrate and Dedicate all there properties with themselves unto  God in order to become Lawful Heirs to the Celestial Kingdom of God, it was under such a view of the subject & in   obedience to the cammandments of God that I consecrated what I had (though but little) before Bishop Edward  Partridge who was the Presiding Bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in Clay County Mo. Dec 31 1834  The following is a copy of the consecration.    Clay County Missouri Dec 31st 1834. Be it known that I Wilford Woodruff do freely covenant with my God that  I freely consecrate and Dedicate myself together with all my Propertyies and Effects unto the Lord for the  purpose of assisting in building up his Kingdom even Zion on the Earth that I may keep his Law & lay all things  before the Bishop of the Church that I may be a Lawful heir to the Kingdom of God even the Celestial Kingdom    The following is an inventory of my Property laid Before the Bishop    One Due Bill payable in one year $20.

Total $240.00    I received a Letter from my Brother Azmon Woodruff the Latter Part of Nov 1834  which gave me much sorrow. He was my Eldest Brother and a vary religious man from his  childhood up, and he laboured hard to know the will of God and to do it. He believed in the  ancient order of the Church, and he rejoiced when the fulness of the gospel came unto us and  was baptized under the hands of Zerah Pulsipher at the same time that I was and when I left I  gave him a power of Attorney to sell my Property at the same time that he did his so that He could  come on to Zion. The following is an extract of his letter which shows that he had Apostitized  and left the Church His letter was Dated Richland Oswago County N Y. Aug 9th 1834.    "Brother Wilford I wish to call your Attention a few moments while we take a glance at what is  called Mormonism. you well know that my mind was tryed on the subject before you left us in  the spring. I have since you left endeavored to look at the subject with an impartial Eye and  weigh it in an ^even^ balance and try it by Gods word and spirit, even the word spoken by the Ancient Apostles  and Prophets and by Christ himself and if any man speak not according to this word Judge ye  whether in such a case it is right to receive or not." "Joseph Smith says by Revelation that there  shall be 500 ^or less^ of the Lords warriors or valiant menyoung men and middle Aged raised who should go up to  Redeem and Defend Zion, and you are not ignorant Brother of their taken carnal weapons such as  fire Arms spears dirks swords &c &c. Jesus Christ sayes put up thy sword into its sheath all they that taketh   the sword shall perish with the sword [##Matthew 26:52##]. Further more Jesus sayes if thine Enemy hunger feed him if he thirst  give him drink [##Romans 12:20##]. Again love ye your Enemies bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you  and pray for them that despitefully use ^you^ and persecute you [##Matthew 5:44##], and all this for what, the answer is that ye may  be like your Father in heaven. Again Jesus says unto you that ye resist not evil if the a man smite you  on the one cheek, offer the other also [##Matthew 5:39##]. He did not say after you have been smitten once, thrice or twice take the  sword and fight and slay your enemies, but the contrary, he taught both by precept and example. And  perhaps you may ask shall we suffer our Enemies to destroy us. shall we suffer ourselves to be trodden down  as the mire of the streets and make no resistance. In answer I would say If we take Jesus for an  Ensample sure it is that we should not fight and resist evil. for when was our great Ensample  ever known to retaliate or resist, or revenge or take vengance. No this He never done but suffered  himself to be lead as a sheep to the slaughter and like a Lamb before his shearers &c" [##Isaiah 53:7##] Now Brother  how near a like is the procedings of the Mormons and example and precepts of Christ I will tell you" 
 as much alike as light and darkness. And there is as much agreement between in the proceedings of the morm-  ons and their preceps & examples of Christ as there is between Christ and Balial and no more. If I am able to  Judge in this respect. If they persecute you in this city flee ye into another [##Matthew 10:23##] does this look like disputeing  the ground with the point of the sword at the peril of our lives. there is much in the Testimony if my limits would  admit that I would like to call your attention unto but cannot at this time" "There is one thing more  however that I cannot forbear to mention and that is division in families or rather breaking up of families  as to the revelations upon this point I am not so well informed, but have understood from the Brethren from   different setctions that it was the duty of heads of families or say the Husband or man as he is the head if he is a  believer it is his duty to forsake ^pursuade^ his wife to go with him up to Zion if in his power but if she will not be pursuaded  to go with him, then it is his duty to gather up his substance and go up to Zion and leave his wife & family behind  Now I would ask what is there in the Old or New Testiament that will support a man in such a course as this the  Apostle says if the unbelieveing depart let him depart but there is no liberty given to the believer to leave one of his  family what God hath joined together let no man put assunder. [##Mark 10:9##] Now for instance were I to leave my family & take  with me my substance (if I had any) and go up to Zion should I not according to the testimony (not of Mormonism) but of  Eternal truth be under censure," "should I not be one that refused to provide for his own, even those of his own house  if so then I should be the man that had denyied the faith &c." "I have been taking a view of the revelations of  Joseph Smith and I am persuaded that they not ownly contradict theChrist and the Apostles but they contradict themselves  And I must receive Smiths Revelations and reject Christs or Receive Christs & the Apostles & reject Smith's As  I cannot be vary particular here I will ownly ask you to look at one or two. What does the Revelations say concerning  the Lords warriors the Revelations says as I understood P. P. Pratt That inasmuch as 500 of the Lords warriors &   valiant young men &c raised &c & if 500 could not be had 400, 300, 200 or 100 but not to return less than 100 [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:32-34##] And  I understood the Revelation to say that with them I would redeem Zion and if I understood your letter there was over  200 went up in the camp to redeem Zion armed with various weapons of war. Now the Revelation says that  Zion cannot be redeemed because the strength of the Lords House has not come up" Again you say that the Lord  says by revelation that He is well pleased with those who have come up even as he was pleased with Abraham  And we know that God was so well pleased with Abraham that He swore to him with an oath. Yet we are  informed that the Lord sent the destroying Angel into your camp to purge & clense it. Now Brother if you cannot  see any impropriety and contradiction in those Revelations as well as others, then I ientreat you to stop for   a moment and consider and look again, also the Revelation concerning their stay at Kirtland at first it  was to be but 5 years, now there is to be a Temple built there, and it is to be one of the stake of Zion not to  be removed &c." "I intreat my Brother for Heavens sake & for your own souls sake & Body sake to look at  those things & compare them with themselves & with others of the Revelations And also try them by gGods word  & spirit & see if the spirit of truth which cannot lie, you the spirit of inspiration of the Almighty moving  upon Joseph Smith caused them to be uttered and written for our learning and profit. And whereas two cannot  walk together except they be agreed. and as I understand that God is love & he that dwelleth in God dwelleth in love &  God dwelleth in him [##1 John 4:16##] and that love works no ill to his neighbor [##Romans 13:10##], the fruits of the spirit are peace, joy, longsuffering  gentleness &c [##Galatians 5:22##]. I do confess that I never so learned Christ as to learn war or a disposition to return an injury  to mine Enemy but on the contrary Gods word & spirit teaches to keep co^a^les of fire on the Heads of our Enemies  by rendering good for Evil and Blessing for cursing"—** "I would inform you that in the fore part of July I requ[es]ted  of the Church of Latter Day Saints in Richland to strike off my name from the Church Record as I could no longer  walk with them I freely delivered up all power and Authority that I was invested with by writing Church Articles  &c but as they refused to drop my name I was necessiated to fling in a withdrawing letter and cut myself off from  the connextion. the particulars I cannot now mention." "Dear Brother if I had room I would like to tell you 
 how much of the fulness & Blessings of the gospel of Christ these dear Brethren & sisters of the Mormon  Church in Richland possess. Once their was nobody like Brother Woodruff now he is so bad. If it was  in their power I think they would sift me as wheat. I am glad for one thing and that is my soull,  nor my body my time nor my Eternity is not at their disposal, if it was I should greatly fear   what would become of me. If they are a fair sample of mormonism god Lord Deliver me from  it." "I think it likely you will see me published in the star. I though[t] I would be to quick  for them but do not know but I shall see how far they will go in doing by others as they  would wish others to do by them. I do not doubt but that many sincere honest souls have  gone into the work, such I think will come forth when they see they are going counter  to the testimony of Jesus Christ. You may perhaps think me to severe. But I can  say if I know my own heart that I desire to know the truth yes that truth that maketh  free [##John 8:32-33##] and that brings not into bondage to any man. I think that I realize in some degree that  fire shall try evry mans work of what sort it is [##1 Corinthians 3:13##]. O may the good Lord help us so to build that when the  burning days shall come our works shall a bide the fire and come forth as the most fine gold which may  the Lord grant for his sons sake. Yours in the flesh and I trust in the Lord. Azmon Woodruff    ^The following was written to me in connexion with the foregoing letter. By my Brother Thompson Woodruff^  The following is the Answer which I sent to my Brother Azmon Woodruff in reply to the foregoing Letter    Dear Brother Wilford. I write to inform you that I have arived at home in Richland and found to my  disappointment that you had gone * * Your Father and we all feel vary bad to think you have gone after such  eronius Erronious principles. we think you must be vary much deceived. Why not stay whare you was and worship  your God under the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth and with liberty. And you must know that it is a  great disappointment to your friends to have you go and leave them. It is my wish to have you leave mormonism   and come back, but you can do as you please. But whether we meet in time or not is vary uncertain  but I hope the Lord will forgive us all at last. Your Affectionate Brother Thompson Woodruff    The following is the Answer which I sent to my Brethren Azmon & Thomson Woodruff in reply to the foregoing Letters    Liberty Clay County Missouri Nov 29th 1834    To all my Kinsfolks in Richland. I received your letter  under date of Aug 9th But have not attempted to Answer it untill the present time. But being sensible that  time is short with many of this generation, I feel desireous to address you by letter as I think it vary uncertain  whether I ever ^shall^ behold your faces again untill I f meet you at the bar of the gGreat Jehovah. I would inform   you that my health is good and at present I possess a contented mind. It rejoices my soul that the Lord  hath speared my life to the present time and supported me through so many dangers seen and unseen  both temporally and spiritually and embraced me within the new and Everlasting covenant and given me the  privilege of Enjoying the society of those servants of God who are determined to follow Christ through evil as  well as good report. Brethren; it was a satisfaction to me to hear from you, yet some of the contents of  your letters gcaused me pain and that too for your sakes. And in answering your letter I must answer my ^own^  mind and clear my soul of your Blood, that your Blood be not required at my hands at the bar of God.  And could I have the privilege I would rather clear my mind by conversing face to face than by writing  but as I am wholey deprived of that privilege I feel it my duty to do it by writing and also to answer some  of your questions. Brethren in answering your letter I have no desire to injure your feelings yet I must  be plain and answer my mind and what I say to you I shall say with a realizeing sens that I shall one  day be called to give an account for this act to that God who has made me & redeemed my soul.  Brother Thompson let me answer you by saying that the cause of my leaving Richland when and 
 as I did was not to injure you or out of any ill will towards you but I did this act with a settelled belief  that it was my duty. And I am more and more convinced that I did my duty in so doing. I acknowledge  your question to be vary civil in asking me whiy I "could not stay whare I was and worship God under  the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth and with Liberty." In answering this question I would  say that you have the sentiments of my heart when I say that I verily believe that Lot would have  been as safe to have remained in Sodom after being warned to flee out by the Angel of God as I should  have been to have remained in Richland, calculating to make it my abiding place with the light I had  before me. No I could not remain there and worship God under the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth  because the voice to me is, come out of her ye my people that ye partake not of her sins that ye receive not of her  plagues [##Revelation 18:4##]. Brother Thompson you may be assured that God hath not finished his work on the Earth &  his wsword is hathed in heaven and will soon fall upon Idumea or the world [##Isaiah 34:5##] yea I believe that  most awful events await this generation yea I believe God is about to exhort his power to overthrow Babylon  and to shake both Earth and heaven. yea I believe that sword pestilence and famine await this generation  of the human family who do not repent and turn unto God and stand in Holy places. Brother Thompson  I feel deeply interested in your welfare and salvation both Temporally and spiritually both for time   & Eternity therefore let me this once perhaps for the last time waren you to prepare to meet your gGod and  also this once not to despise & reject the revelations of Jesus Christ for he will soon come to judge every man  for the deeds done in the body. Brother Thompson what more can I say to you, it is a day of warning  & not of many words [##Doctrine and Covenants 63:58##], the day is not far distant when you will know of a truth whether the cause  in which I am Engaged is of God or from a source of Darkness and Error. Yea I verily believe the  hour is nigh at the door that will report in the Ears of those who remain in Babylon far more heart rending scenes   respecting the things which await them & will overtake them than you are permitted to receive from my pen.  Although I should incur the displeasure of many of my fellow men or even my relatives by the grace of  God assisting me I shall not scease to exhort my influence or to lift my voice to warn this generation to prepare  themselves to be accounted worthy to escape the Just Judgements of God that awaits this generation. I do not  expect to remain stationary long in Clay County But I expect to travel south during the winter how much  longer I do not know * * Brother Thompson I now bid you farewell and I desire that while the kingdoms  of this world are overturning that you may receive and obey the celestial Law of God that you may abide  a celestial Glory And that God will Enlighten your understanding to that degree that you may so improve  the blessings which are within your reach in the last days so as to find a seat in the Celestial Kingdom of God with  Abram Isaac and Jacob is the prayer of your Absent Brother Wilford Woodruff    Brother Azmon I not ownly feel it a privilege but my duty to address you this again by writing and  answer some of your questions given to me in your communication. I am sensible we cannot give  a fair representation of things by writing as by word of mouth. We are more liable to form wrong  conceptions of things by letter (even where the intention is good) than by word of mouth. The questions  which you have asked in your letter appear very clear to me and could I see you I think I could e  explain them to your satisfaction but it is a thing almost impossible to do it upon one sheet of paper  yet I feel it my duty to say a few words respeting some of them as it respects carnal weapons being  used by the saints of God in the last days there is much said up on the subject by the Ancient Prophets  The Plough shares are to be beat into swords & the pruneing hooks into spears, Let th[e] weak say I am strong [##Joel 3:10##]  Yea, one is to chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight [##Deuteronomy 32:30##] this is to take place in Gods own time  in the last days. It is to be said to Zion, (according to the Prophet Isaiah) that her horn should be made 
 "Iron and her hoofs Brass and she should beat, in peaces many people &c" [##Micah 4:13##] As it respects the remark I made  about the Lord's being pleased with those who came up in th[e] camp of Zion or they being compared with  Abram, it was their offering which he was pleased with. that is to say they were willing to lay down   thare lives for Christs sake and the sake of their Brethren. Yet He was not pleased with any murmurings  or complainings that might be in the camp but rather they were chastized for it, some mens sins go  to judgment beforehand while others follow after. Again as it respects Kirtland being a stake of Zion  there never has been any revelation given to infringe upon Kirtland's being a stake of Zion or   bearing any import why it should not become a stake & evry word of the Lord be fulfilled.  Because the Lord said He would not hold any guilty who should go up to Zion with an open  heart, after the space of 5 years, which time the Lord willeth to retain a strong hold in the Land of Zion  Kirtland [##Doctrine and Covenants 64:21-22##]. This saying does not prove that Kirtland will not be a stake of Zion for a longer   period than 5 years but it goes to show that the Lord wished many of his servants to remain in  Kirtland that length of time for a special purpose. Neither does it prove because the Lord  has commanded his people to build unto his name a Temple or a city that it will not eventually  be thrown down. Again you say that if the brethren or sisters in Richland are a fair sample  of Mormonism you wish to be delivered from it. I wish to ask you if you consider such means  a fair way to investigate the subject, if they as members of the Church of Christ have done wrong  does this prove that the whole body is corrupted or that it is not a true church. Because there was  a Judas with Christ and the Apostles, does that prove that they were fals teachers or Christ a  fals Prophet certainly not. Brother Azmon I think it is for the want of intelligence &   information that causes you to discover such gross Errors and contradictions (as in your view)  there is in the Revelations given in there last days. for my part I cannot discover any  contradictions in themselves or that contradicts the teachings, precepts, & revelations of Jesus  Christ our Savior. But rather I behold them beaming with gospel light, truth intelligence and glory  Brother Azmon I was not a little surprised to learn from your letter that you had denyed and  rejected the Revelations of Jesus Christ for I know them to be such which you have rejected. I  say I was not a little surprised to learn this fact after your having received as great a degree of  light as you have in your day and generation. Let me this one call your mind to review the past with  reflection, and at the same time permit me to ask you some questions. I wish you to call to mind the days and  years of your youth. while standing as it were alone to maintain and contend for that faith once delivered  to the Saints. Also the many times you have stood and proclaimed in the ears of this generations those  things which awaited them if they rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ. Again have you not long been  looking for the Church of Christ to arise out of the wilderness of darkness and Error yea when you  heard the sound of the gospel proclaimed did you not gladly receive it with your whole soul and went  forth and was baptized the first sermon that you herd an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter  day saints deliver unto the people. I now wish to ask you, By what spirit was you actuated and moved upon  when you bore witness unto your fellow men and testifyed unto them that the spirit of God bore witness to  you of the truth of the Book of Mormon and by what spirit was you governed when you went  to Brother Holton in the name of the Lord and told him if He rejected the work which the Latter Day  Saints brought unto us that his days would be short and what light he had would be taken from him  And also when you told Wm Hubbard that you knew that He would be condemned if He rejected it  And also when you declaired that you was Delivered both soul and body by the laying on off hands of 
 Elder Zerah Pulsipher in the name of the Lord. I believe that you was actuated and moved upon by the spirit of  God yea I believe that you was honest and sincere in those things. And if this was the case let me now  ask by what spirit are you governed and controlled when you turn around and deny and reject these  things it certainly is not of God. And now Brother Azmon considering exhisting circumstances  with you I cannot forbear unreservedly telling you what I Believe concerning you and your course  when I have behel the light and Glory that the Celestial Law and kingdom of God is presenting to us in these  last days it has been a source of Great Enjoyment to me in the reflection that the day was near when  I should Join with you in the kingdom of God in partaking of those Celestial Immortal and Eternal  glories But Alas how am I disappointed Brother Azmon unless you repent like Peter and humble  yourself before God I do not ever expect to meet you there. [##Matthew 26:75##] Dear Sir you have but a faint  idea of the immortal Joys & glories that you have in a voluntary manner deprived yourself  the privilege of ever enjoying. I intreat you in Christ stead to stop while to stop is in your  power and consider the awful calamity and destruction you are bringing upon your own soul.  I mean by denying the Lord that bought you, and put him to an open shame. perhaps you may  consider this a light thing But those revelations which you have denyed are the Revelation of Jesus  Christ And you will soon find it a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God. I had not  received your letter when I sent you the Book of Commandments and if you have received them  and consider them of No worth unto you, You will do me a favor by giving them to Brother Fisk  or to someone in the church of the Latter Day Saints. But above all things I warn you to beware about  treating those things with disdain or making ridiclule of them for of a truth if you do they will  rise in Judgment against you. you now profess to believe those revelations to be of man & not of God  but should they at last prove to be of God it would be better for you that they had not fallen into your hands  inasmuch as you treat lightly the things which they contain. But there is no doubt upon my mind upon  this subject And I again warn you in the name of Jesus Christ that you no more tread lightly those  Revelations and Commandments for in so doing you treat with disdain the council of the Almighty  and set at naught the Revelations of Jesus Christ and if you continue to do those things they will serve  to pearce your soul Yea if you continue such a course and do not repent you will have cause to  drink with carefulness & Eat your bread with trembling for your days of prosperity will be few  Brother Azmon the day is nigh even at your own door when you will know of a truth that these  sayings are not fables but Eternal truths. the time is at hand when the heavens will be rolled together as  a scroll and Jesus Christ will be revealed in the clouds of Heaven with his saints to take vengance on  those who know not God and obey not the Gospel And He will reward evry man according to the deeds  done in the body.    Brother Azmon I have dealt thus plain with you that I may be clear of your  Blood and be found acquitted at the bar of God. I think it doubtful whether I meet you short of  the Eternal world. But I commend you into the hands of Almighty God who doeth all things  wright. I leave these remarks in your hands to deal with as you see fit. But remember we are  Accountable to God for all the deeds done in the Body That the Lord will be merciful unto you and deliver  you from Darkness And Error, give you light and truth & so direct your remaining days as to cause you to  repent and humble yourself before God that you may again Embrace the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel & the  New and everlasting covenant that you may escape the Just Judgments of God is the earnest Prayer of you[r]  Absent Brother.    I would say to all my friends that I desire your welfare and your salvation And  I intreat you all not to treat lightly or abuse any sacred things or principles which you have in 
 your possession or within your reach for the day is at hand that will try many souls. As it respects  myself I can say the cause I am ingaged in I will never renounce for friend or foe. No by the  grace of God Assisting me I am determined that neither the powers of Earth or Hell wicked men  or devils shall ever separate me from the New and Everlasting Covenant which God hath  made in these last days with his Saints. I to highly prize and value the Blessings embraced  in this covenant to part with such glorious treasures for any shineing straws that are  floating down lifes stream. There is virtues in this covenant that will give a man Joy  when this Earth shakes like chaos and will fill him with Joy and felicity and glory at the  sight of his Lord and Master in the clouds of heaven Yea their souls will be inspired  with the recollection that they have fought the good fight, that they have finished their  course and are now prepared to receive there crowns [##2 Timothy 4:7-8##]. Yea I essteem the reproach of  Christ greater riches than the treasures of the Earth [##Hebrews 11:26##] and I am determin to spend  my days in the cause even if Father, Mother, Brothers, Sister, and all my kindred oppose  me for in some degree I know the value of the cause in which I am Engage And if God be  for me who can be against me? [##Romans 8:31##] As Ever I remain your Brother Wilford Woodruff.    CHAPTER VI.    My ordination to the Aaronic Priesthood My first mission to Preach the gospel  My travels through Missouri, Arkansas, and Tennessee Incidents of My Journey    Having embraced the fulness of the Everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ and seeing in  it great beauty, power, Glory, and salvation I had a great desire to teach it to my fellow  men and this desire increased upon me and rested with great wait upon my mind, but  I did not reveal this to any man. But one sunday evening I retired into the woods alone  by myself and called upon the Lord in mighty Prayer to open my way to go & Preach the  gospel of salvation to the children of men, the spirit of the Lord rested upon me and bore  witness unto me that my Prayer was heard & should be answered upon my head I arose  from ^my^ knees happy and walked some 40 rods through a thick wood into an open road  as I entered the road there stood before me Judge Elias Higby an High Priest with whom  I had associated daily but he had never passed a word with me about Preaching to my recollection  but now as I approached him He said "Brother Wilford the spirit of the Lord tells me that  you should be ordained and go & preach the gospel.["] I said vary well if it is the will of the Lord  I am ready. It was a Practice at this time in Zion if anyone was to be ordained to be recom-  mended by the branc[h] where they lived And at a meeting of the High Council Held at  Lyman Wights, Clay County, Missouri, On the 5th day of Nov 1834 Brother Lyman  Wight called a vote of the Branch of the Church to recommend Stephen Winchester, Heman  T Hyde & Wilford Woodruff to the High Council for ordination the vote was unanimous Then  the High Council voted to ordain us the office of Priest. Brother Simeon Carter was appointed to  to ordain us we were Accordingly ordained under his his hand to the office of a Priest on this  5 day of Nov 1834.    I Received the following license. To whom these presents may come    This certifies that Wilford Woodruff has been received into this Church of Latter Day Saints organized  on the 6th day of April AD 1830 and has been ordained a Priest according to the rules & regulations 
 of said Church and is duly authorized to preach the gospel and act in all the ordinances of the House of the  Lord agreeable to the Authority of the office.    Given by the direction of a council of Elders assembled in  Clay County Missouri Nov 5th 1834  John Whitmer    I called upon Bishop Edward Partridge and asked him whare my mission should be in what part of the country  I should go to preach the gospel. He replyed that He would like to have some of the Brethren go into the Southern States  through Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, &c if he could find any body who had faith Enough to go for it would  be a hard mission & a hard mission country to travel in at present in consequence of the Missouri persecution  I told him I was as ready to go South as any whare Els if he wished it. As Arkansas lay south of Mo I  asked him if I should go through Jackson County as that county lay direct in our path. He said it would be  a risk of ones life but if I had faith to undertake it I might do it He had not. I asked him if I went  through Jackson County should I start without "Purs or scrip" He said he had not faith enough to attempt  it through Jackson County if I had I might try it. As the commandments required the Elders to travel  without purse or scrip I felt strenuous to keep the commandments so I resolved to go without purse or scrip  I wished to have some companion to go with me upon my mission as I did not wish to launch forth into the open world  alone I called upon Brother Henry Brown (who had gone accompanied me from Richland N. Y. to M.o.)  I laid before him my intended mission and requested him to acompany me, it met his wishes and he agreed  to go with me and we immediately commenced preparing for our Journey which we were soon prepared and  on the 13th day of January 1835 I received the following Recommend    Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, Jan 13th 1835. This certifies that Wilford Woodruff has faithfully discharged  evry duty required of him in the Camp of the Saints in Journeying from Kirtland Ohio to this place, has been  very faithful in the discharge of his duty since his arival here both spiritual & temporal, is strong in the  faith of the Latter Day Saints and worthy of his calling he is recommended by the Church in this place  to any branch whare Providence may call him  Lyman Wight    After receiving the above recommend I bid Brother Wight & family goodby and shouldered my voliese  weighing 15 lbs, mostly Books of Mormon, and started in company with Elder Henry Brown upon my first  mission upon this 13th day of Jan 1835. we started without purse or scrip. I also took with me a petition  to the Governor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done us biy the inhabitants of Jackson County in driving  us from our homes iand lands in Jackson County Missouri. this was a bold move as we were about to  pass through Jackson County & should we be caught by the mob & the petition found with us it might  cost us our lives. But I felt to lift up my heart in prayer to God to preserve us from the hand of our  enemies and to Grant us wisdom & make us meet for our Masters use and assist us to rightly divide  the word of truth & give evry man their portion of meat in due season that our garments might  be clear of the Blood of all men. We crossed the Missouri River in a ferry bout & landed in Jackson  County as we steped upon the bank two horsemen went into the boat they Eyed us vary close but said  nothing to us. this was the first time that my feet had ever troad the soil of Jackson County Missouri  and I felt to thank God for the privilege we bowed down upon our knees before God & offered up our  petitions & thanksgivings unto God while at the same time that Land was polluted by wicked and   ungodly men. we travelled 23 miles & spent the night with one Brother Benson who still remained in  that county & we got 5 signers to the ^petition to the^ Governor of Missouri for wrongs done us by the Jackson  County Mob. 14th Travelle[d] but 5 miles & spent the night with Brother Charles McClure & got him  to sign the petition. 15th Travelled 12 miles through some of the most beautiful rolling prairie I 
 Jan 15th 1835    ever behold which was ownly inhabited by deer, wolves, &c. We spent the night with  Brother J. Hitchcock still in Jackson County He signed the petition to the Governor    16th We Travelled 12 miles south of Grand River and was kindly received by Mr James  Porter we preached the gospel to him & his household the distance of the day was 23 miles    17th we travled 26 miles and was kindly received by one Mr Walker within 12 miles of the Harmony Mission    18th we travelled to the Harmony Mission we there had an interview with the President of  the mission a Presbyterian Minister He knew we were mormons he looked upon us with  scorn it was near sundow when we left him & it was 15 miles to the nearest house on  the Osage River which was an indian trading House kept by A Frenchman named Jarew  I asked the Missionary to give us the direction to the House. He said there was but one straitght  road & that forked but once said the right hand fork was the one for us to take, the spirit said  to me he was deceiving us I asked him the question tree times over And he affirmed  each time that he was telling us the truth, we took his direction and it led us into the Osage  River swamp and we were lost in the darkness of the night. we undertook to follow the  river but it being about the crookedest one on Earth & we wallowing in mud & water we  made but slow progress we finally struck out into the open prairie concluding to lie  down till day light. But the Osage Indians were having a pa wa at the traiding post  and by the sound of their drums, hoops, yiels, & shouts, we were guided into their midst  near midnight vary weary & covered with mud, about a dozen large savage Indgian  dogs surrounded us before we got into camp came & smelt of us in a friendly manner  but did not either bite or bark. We were vary kindly received & entertained by Mr  Jerew through the night He had an Osage Squaw for a wife. she got us a good  supper but marvelled that we did not drink coffee. she offered us their best  bed which we did not except off as we were as were covered with mud, she then made  us a good bed before a large fire whare we slept till Morning. May the Lord reward  both Mr. Jerruw & wife also the Priesbyterian Minister both according to their deserts    19th This morning Mr Jarrew furnished us with a good breakfast sent an Indian to set us across  the Osage River, and we started upon our long days Journey it being 60 miles to the nearest House in  the direction in which we were travelling & we had not one mouthful of any kind of food with us  my feet were quite lame in the morning being galled by my boots while travelling in the mud &   water the night before we travelled in a South East direction we crossed a long level prairie  we travelled in but little timber through the day. we came into timber about dark a large black  boar [bear] came out of the timber & met us on the prairie we had no weapons of any kind when He  approached within a few rods of us he arose upon his hind feet and examined us closely then left  us & went away in another course. we travelled vary hard & fast all day as we wished to get  to a house, at about 9 oclok at night we were travelling in the woods it was exceding dark we had  great difficulty in keeping the road, we were surrounded by a hungry drove of woolves what number  we could not tell, but their seemed to be many of them, they would rush upon us & come within  a few feet of us & then fall back and kept up a continual Howling we travelled in the midst  of them in ^this^ way for about one hour untill we felt that it was dangerous to travel in such company  we concluded to build a fire & wait untill morning Having fireworks with us we struck up a  great fire of large oak limbs & the wolves retreated to the distance. as we were about to lie down 
 for the night to await the light of day, we heard the barking of a dog and soon the Jingling of a cowbell we took  each of us a fire brand in our hand and we soon arived at a House occupied by a Mr Williams who was  in Jackson County during the mobings of the Saints. He & his family was in one room of an old log  cabbin about 12 feet square & one bed in the room, upon which lay his wife & children & several small  dogs He lay streached out upon the bare floor with his feet to a small fire there was no door to  the House but a ragged quilt Hung up in the door way I removed the blanket looked in & saw evry  thing people & dogs in a sound sleep I spoak 3 times & no one stired or answered I then steped to  the man & put my hand upon his shoulder & shook him to wake him up the moment he felt the  wait of my hand upon his shoulder he leaped to his feet & began to run around his room leaping  as high as He could evry stept in great Fright, I told him not to be alarmed that we were  friends & travelers & would not hurt him and asked the privilege to stay in his house over night  when He came to his senses he gave us permission to stop with him & lie upon the bare floor as He  did which we excepted off. He said the cause of his being Frightened was that a few evenings  before he had shot a large panther which stood in his door & he thought that his mate had lit upon  him. I asked him for sumthing to Eat as we had travelled 60 miles without Eating He said He had  nothing cooked to eat he lived by his rifle would have to hunt game for his breakfast so we  lay down upon the bare floor vary hungry & weary but we were vary thankful for that  plase for it soon began to rain & we had a vary hard rainy knight but we slept sound most  of the night finding it still raining when we awoke This was in Polk County    20th we arose this morning still Hungry & started in the rain upon our Journey we travled 12 miles  to a house which was the nearest one to whare we staid last night, this House was occupied  by one Mr Cornor He was also From Jackson County & was acquainted with the mobing  of the Saints He was an Enemy nevertheless he asked us to take sum breakfast as He knew  we were Hungry we ate a vary harty meal while he sat & swore at us vary severely  because we were mormons. when we stoped Eating we thanked him for our food for we felt  thankful for it as we had 72 miles without Eating we then went our way crossed a river  & travelled 18 miles & spent the night with Mr William Crisp in Polk County we preached  the gospel to him & family He seemed quite satisfied with it    21 we again crossed the river & travelled 15 miles & spent the night with Col Robert  Pollan who received us vary kindly we preached the gospel to him    22nd Travelled across Spring River & on 15 miles to Mr. Fishers in Green County  we gave out an appointment for Preaching on the morrow    23rd We travled to Mr Nathan Turners in Green County whare we spent the night we gave out  an Appointment for Preaching on the morrow at Mr Turners house    24 I preached at Mr Turners house the first time that I ever attempted to preach to a public congregation  there was quite a snow storm during the time I had good liberty & was followed by Brother Brown  at the close of the meeting we went one mile & spent the night with Mr Charles J Peas    25 On Sunday we Travled 3 miles & Preached at the House of Mr Joseph Hendersons in   Green County Mr Henderson and family were believing and vary friendly, they father &   son both signed the petition to the Governor, they all bid us God speed    26 We travelled across Shoal Creek continued 14 miles & spent the night with Wm C Paine in Barry County    27 We travelled 20 miles & spent the night with Samuel Vaughn being near the State Line 
 Jan 28th 18535 We travelled this day out of the state of Missouri into the state of Arkansas and was glad to  get out of the state for a season. We felt that the Lord had preserved our lives while travelling through  Jackson County in one instance in a miraculous manner we came suddenly upon a grog  shop filled with about 60 of the mob with none outside but the door was open which we  had to pass right by, but just before we got against it some man shut the door so we passed by  unpercieved we had travelled near two miles beyond the shop before we were discovered  then the came out & parraded before the House & looked at us but did not feel disposed to follow  us but had we been seen while passing the House it would probably have cause us our lives  we travelled 24 miles on this 28th day & spent the night with Mr Andrew Nail in Washington County  He received us vary kindly we also spent the 29th with him in consequence of a hard storm of snow & rain    30th We trough Fayettville & onto Mr Ingham's in Washington County & spent the night 20 miles    31st We travelled 8 miles & spent the night with Mr John Billingsly in Washington County    Feb 1st 1835 Sunday I preached at the House of Mr John Billingsly's to an attentive congregation  much of the spirit of the Lord rested upon us while speaking    2nd We travled 25 miles we passed through some cane breaks or fields this day the first that I had ever  seen. we passed into LCrawford County & spent the night with Mr Sanford Elmore    3rd We travelled 20 miles crossed Frogbyow Creek & spent the night with Andrew Boyd    4th Travelled 20 miles in Crawford County, spent the night crossed little & big Mulberry Creek  And also white oak creek & spent the night with Mr John Simsns in Crawford County    5th Travelled 20 miles crossed White Oak Creek & spent the night with another Mr Simms ^Nickolson^    6 Crossed the Arkansas River in a Ferry boat. Also crossed Short Mountain Creek, and   spent the night with S. U. Walker Distance of the day 30 miles    7 Travelled 26 miles crossed a large creek & spent the night with Mr Wm Riley, Scott Co  8th I had the following Dream during the night while at Wm Rileys I thought that Brother  Brown & myself were commanded to walk in a strait Narrow Path let it lead where it might  while walking in this path it lead to the door of a house with high walls so we could not get around the House  without going through it. I opened the door and saw the room was filled with large serpents I shuddered  at the sight & tried to avoid going through the room but I could not do it so I steped into the room to go  through trusting my life in the hands of God, and as I got near the center of the floor all the snakes  arose in a curve with their heads several feet from the floor & sprung at me as though they would  devour me in an instant there was one much larger then the rest & he struck at my face Just before  he reached me he droped dead & evry one drop dead in the room, they burst open, took fire, & were consumed  & I passed through the room unharmed I then awoke, in the morning I told Brother Brown my dream  & told him that we were going to meet with opposition but we should conquer & it was nigh us    8th [FIGURE] Our expectations were high this morning of meeting with Latter Day Saints as we were  now in the Neighborhood of the Akeman family who were in the persecution in Jackson County  Father Akeman had a family of sons grown up large tall men they were all in the persecution  his wife died strong in the faith in Jackson County. his Name was Allexander Akeman  some of his sons were severely whiped in Jackson among whom was Willis Akeman. the old  Gentleman was surrounded with his sons who had settelled around him he was living alone with  one Daughter. This 8th day of Feb was sunday we arose in the morning took breakfast & walked  5 miles to Mr Akemans House, went into his house expecting to meet a friend we passed complements 
 Febuary 8th 1835    with him but he received us vary coldly & we soon found that he had Apostitized & was  bitter against the Church He found much fault with the Leading men of the Church & said the Book of  Mormon came from the Devil, and he told us the people in the Neighborhood would be opposed to mormonism  I soon began to see that here was the field for my dream to be fulfilled in. I asked Mr Akemans if thare   was not some in that Neighborhood who were in the faith of the gospel he said his son Wright Akeman  professed to be in the faith he lived near by with another of his sons we might see him he directed us  where he lived we went down to see him. We found him a little like a drowning man neither dead or alive  we got him into the woods prayed and talked with him for hours and at last he appeared to have a litterle life  we took up our abode with him for a short time    9th As it began to be noised abroad that there was two mormon preachers in the place it created quite a stir  up & down Petty John Creek which was thickly settelled for 20 or 30 miles, the people began to cry out  against us & said they ^would^ mob us and ride us upon rails & c Brother Brown was for leaving but I told him  I felt resolved to stay & see my dream out. Soon the people began to be taken sick & die as though the  cholera ^was^ upon every hand we spent the day at Mr Akemans    10th We Travelled around the Neighborhood some 6 miles Assisted Mr Willis Akeman in some business    11th There was an Aged man living near by named Johnathan Hubbel He had read the Book of Mormon  and Believed it. He called upon us and invited us to make his house our home while we tarried in  the place we went home with him & spent the night    12th We spent the day at Mr Hubbels in writing    13th I wrote a Letter to the Brethren in Zion. we were now hearing of Deaths all most daily around  us. I had been impressed several times to go up & visit Mr Allexander Akeman who had apostitized  & bear my testimony to him of the truth of Mormonism but whenever I did it I met the powers of  darkness and opposition so great that my mouth was closed & I had no freedom of speech and  the last time I visited him the opposition to me was so great that I resolved I would never called  upon him again, unless I was commanded of the Lord to do so. the opposition was increasing around  us yet we had given out some Appointments for preaching    14th day of Feb 1835 This was an important day to me. In company with Brother Brown I took my ax  and went into the woods to help Brother Hubbel clear some land. we continued choping untill 3 oclock  in the Afternoon, the spirit of the Lord came upon me like a rushing mighty wind & the voice of the spirit  said to me go up again & visit Mr Akeman again bear testimony unto him of the truth of the  Book of Mormon & the work of God. I marvelled at this I told Brother Brown what the spirit  said to me. He said I might go if I wished but He should not. I carried my Ax to the House  & walked up to Mr Akemans about 1 1/2 miles through a plesant grove meditating upon this strange  operation of the spirit onto me & was in a deep gloomy frame of mind and thought as I approached  the House I saw the door open and Mr Akeman walking the floor I felt particularly  impressed to ask if he was well He said he never felt better in health. I told him I had  come to again bear testimony unto him of the truth of the Book of Mormon & the work of God and  the danger of opposing that work. He soon was filled with wrath & indignation and He opp[os]ed  me in the storongest tearms and raged against the leaders of the Church, my mouth was more closed  up than before I felt that the house was filled with devils & awful darkness I felt Horreaibly 
 Febuary 14th 1835  ^[FIGURE]^ I did not understand why the Lord should send me into the midst of such spirits to bear testimony  of his work I felt vary strangely my tongue was glued to my mouth I could not speak I  arose to my feet to leave the House. I felt as though the floor moved under my feet & when I  stoped upon the ground I felt that I was surrounded with devils and I felt like fleeing as Lot  did when He went out of Sodom, without looking behind me. [##Genesis 19:17##] Mr Akeman followed me  out of the door close to my heels about 8 rods without either of us speaking I knew he was  following close to me when about 8 rods from the House this strange feeling left me in  the twinkling of an Eye and when Mr Akeman got to the place where this feeling left  me he fell dead at my feet as though he had been struck with a thunderbolt from Heaven  I herd him fall to the Earth, but I was so agitated I did not look behind me at all  his daughter stood in the door way saw him fall she fainted & fell at the same time & neither  of them spoke a word that I could hear, I continued to walk down to Mr Hubbels as  fast as I could meditating upon the strange dealings of God with me still not knowing  that Mr Akeman was dead. I arived at Mr Hubbels Just at dark in a peculiar  state of Mind. supper was ready we all sat down to the table blessing was asked I took  up my knife & fork to commence eating and I herd a horse coming upon a full run  I droped my knife & fork & listened, a man rode up to our door and cryed out Mr  Akeman is dead I want you to go there immediately. In a moment my eyes were open to under-  stand the whole subject I felt satisfied with the dealings of God with me in calling me to go & warn him  as soon as his daughter came to her senses she ran to her nearest brothers & gave the alarm we walked up to  the house as soon as we could when we arived there we found all of his sons in the house around his body  wailing in an awful manner. he was naturally a large man but when we come to see his dead body   it was swollen to a great extent it appeared as though his skin was ready to crack open & he was  as black as an Affrican. We immediately went to work & made a large box and put him into it  I continued to think of my dream    15th Sunday we had an Appointed a meeting at Mr Hubbels for Preaching to day but in consequence of the death  of Mr Akeman but few came together I spent the day there conversing upon the gospel    16 [FIGURE] We attended the funeral & assisted in burying the body of Mr Akeman I preached the gospel to  the people at the close I got 10 signers to the petition to the Govornor of Missouri. we also continued to  hear of Deaths around us almost daily    17 We travelled from Mr Akemans to Mr Elijah Bakers Preached at his house according to appointment  from thence to Josiah Harts who invited us to spend the night with him & we did so he was 74 75years of Age    18th Travelled to Wm Wit's 5 miles got 5 signers to the petition and A patriot in the Revolution He signed the petition    19 Walked to Mr Hubbels and Preached according to an appointment at his house we got 6 signers to  our petition. we then walked 4 miles to Benjamin Snellin's    20th We walked in the morning to Brother Wright Akemans & spent the day labouring with our hands  In the evening we walked 3 miles to Mr IHubbels & spent the evening in Preaching the word  of the Lord to his household. Brother Brown spoke in Tongues & interpreted the same the spirit of  of the Lord rested upon us    21st Spent the day labouring with our hands & the night with Mr Snelling who was dangerously sick 
 February 22nd 1835    22 Sunday we Preached to Mr Hubbel's to a full House at the close of the meeting Brother  Brown Baptized Mr Hubbel & his wife    23rd Brother Brown was now vary anxious to continue his Journey down the Arkansas River to Little Rock  cross the Missippi bottom and go into the State of Tennessee. This is an Error which many Elders fall  into as soon as they get doors open for preaching & the people were ready to receive it they will run away  & leave them this was the case with us. We had been there 13 days had met with much opposition in  the begining but the Lord had sent Judgment upon our opposers & there had been more than 20 death in the  neighborhood during our stay with the people, and our worst opposer had droped dead at my feet, my dream  had its pe[r]fect fulfillment, prejudice had given way, & the people were Just ready to Embrace the gospel &  pleading with us to stay and preach to them, which had we have done we certainly should have built up a   church in that place. I wished to stop & labour with the people as the Lord had opened doors for us, But Br  Brown would not consent. He was Holding the office of an Elder, I a Priest, And I felt that I must  be subject to any one over me in office so I had to yield much to the grief of the people & in opposition  to my own Judgment. We left Brother Hubbel's accompanied by Brother Wright Akeman travelled 23 miles  crossed the Arkansas River for the purpose of making a canoe to go down the river in we spent the  night with John Morse    24 We went onto the Bank of the River cut down a cottonwood tree 4 feet in diamieter & cut  off 12 feet of the butt of it & spent the day in diging it out    25 We finished our canoe & launchied it put on a good pair of oars & tied it to a tree    26th We crossed the River returned 23 miles to Brother Hubbel's to attend to an Appointment which we had left    27 We spent the day labouring with our hands we did not eat the bread of Idleness but we spent all our  leisure time in labour where ever we were this I considered to be right    28th We Preached at Brother Hubbels House    March 1st 1835 Sunday & my birth day I Preached to day to a large congregation at Brother Hubbels House  and the last time we ever preached to the people in that settlement there was a great anxiety among the people about  our leaving them they left the meeting with tears in their eyes I was 28 years of age this day    2nd I took the Parting Hand with Brother & Sister Hubbel & all our Friends upon Petty John Creek we were  accompanied By Brother Wright Akeman we travelled to the dardanells crossed the river and was  kindly received by Mr John Morse, here we found Mr Wm & Willis Akeman I got 7 signers  to the petition today. travelled 23 miles    3rd A Frenchman by the name of Sangrain made us an offer to take us down the river in a Flat bottom  boat & pay us some wages if we would stop a few days we excepted his proposals & went to labouring  for him with our hands we spent the week choping & spliting black wallnut rails up to the 7th    8th Sunday I preached at the house of Mr John Morse. Brother Brown & myself visited the top  of the high Bluffs at the dardanells & engraved our names in the rock. This is the high station which  the Osage Indians chose to look for their Enemies in time of war it is several hundred feet perpendicular  to the ground below & it is said that the Indians formerly flung their prisioners down this precipice where  they were dashed to peaces    9, & 10 We continued to labour for Mr Sangrain we saw some dangerous reptiles while here such as  Tarantula & Centipedes which are numerous in Arkansas 
 March 11th 1835    11th In consequence of low water Mr Saugrain informed us that he had abandoned the idea  of going down the river with a boat so we must look to our own resources again, so we concluded to  procede on our Journey in our canoe. We left Mr Saugrain embarked in our canoe travelled 25 miles  down the river to Petty John Mountain and stoped for the night with A Mr Barnet Pope County    12  We rowed our canoe to day 50 miles & spent the night in a place called the Cadron there were a number  of good Houses built & all was deserted it was said the place was haunted we went into a house that  must have cost $3 or $4000, that was called the worst Haunted house there was not a human being  in many miles of the place but ourselves we built up a good fire rosted a peace of pig & ate it with some  corn dugar [sugar] givien us in the morning by apoor woman we asked a blessing & prayed then climbed  into one of the chambers on the starirs were broaken down we lay down upon the floor it was a cold  night we had nothing to cover us I soon fell asleep without any regard to the gosts that haunted the  place I dreamed that I called at My Fathers House & my step Mother made me up a good Feather  bed I lay down upon it & had a good nap & rested me well. I did not awake untill near sun-  rise when instead of Finding myself upon a Feather bed at My Fathers House in Farmington Ct  I was lying my back against a bare deserted, Haunted, chamber wall on the Bank of the Arkansas  River quite cold & chilly I awoke Brother Brown we arose not having been disturbed by Ghosts  13 or evil spirits we prayed built a fire warmed ourselves eat what little we had left & started in our  canoe down the river after walking onto the top of the black bluffs & taking a survey of the country  13 We travelled 40 miles and spent the night with Samuel Blackburn Pulaski County    14th We travelled to Little Rock and spent three quarters of ahn hour visiting the city then  continued down the River 10 miles and was kindly received for the night by Mr Isaac  Jones in Pulaski County we travelled during the day 53 miles    15 We spent the day with Mr Jones and Preached the gospel to him and his household    16 We left our canoe with Mr Jones and travelled up the River 10 miles untill we reached  the old military road leading from Memphis Tennessee to Little Rock Arkansas we took   this road and started Eastward for Memphis. This road lay through the Missippi swamp  175 miles to Memphis mostly covered with water which we would have to wade through  we walked 22 miles and spent the night with Col Blues in Pulaski County we got 2 signers to  to our petion    17 We walked 40 miles through mud and water and spent the night with Mr Thomas Cribbins  in Monroe County    18 We walked 18 miles and spent the night with Mr James P Kellean    19, 20, 21 We spent the time in labouring with our hands for Mr Kellean    22 Sunday we spent the day Preaching at the house of Mr Kellean    23 We walked 40 miles through mud and water and spent the night at the House of  Mr Wm Scloin at second creek St Francis County    24th [FIGURE] We started this morning as usual in the mud and water I had not gone but a short  distance untill I was taken with such a rheumatic pain in one of my knees that I  could not travel. My companion Elder Harry Brown was vary anxious to take a speedy  journey to the River & take a steamer up the Missippi and Hasten to his family in Kirtland 
 To my Grand Daugher   Florence Snow Critchlow  May God Bless You and   Make you the Mother of Many   children who May be righteous and   your Posterity remain on the   Earth untill the coming of the   Son of Man    your Affectionate Grand Father   Wilford Woodruff  March 1, 1897 
 March 24th 1835   he therefore thought we had Better separate as he wished to travel faster than I could in my  lame situation. I did not object to the proposition though I thought I should not be willing to leave  a ^lame^ companion in the ministry in an open swamp without knowing whether he would ever be  able to walk far enough to again ever meet withe any company more acceptable than the wolves, bears,  and alegators with which Ie was surrounded. However we parted to meet no more for several years  he left me sitting upon a log in the mud and water without any food and 12 miles to the nearest  House upon my road. He I gazed upon him as he hastened out of my sight I then knelt down  in the water and prayed the Lord in Faith and asked him in the name of Jesus Christ  to heal me up and open my way so that I could continue my Journey, and the Lord heard  my Prayer and the spirit of God descended upon me and I was healed and I arose and went  my way rejoiceing. I walked 14 miles and was kindly recieved and Entertained for the night  by Mr John Casber here was quite a settlement the people came together and filled his house  I preached to them and bore a strong testimony of the work of God revealed in our day. Brother  Brown ownly gained 3 miles of me during the days travel and in trying to travel the last 3 miles  in the Evening he got lost in a thicket of Brambles or mohawk briars He& tore nearly all  the cloths of[f] his body and it took him nearly all night to mend them up at the cabin  whare he stoped    25th I walked 20 miles crossed St Francis River got 3 signers to my Petition and spent  the night with Mr Wm A. Jefferson    26 I walked 14 miles through mud and water and preached at the House of Willis Fields in  Crittenton County, and got Eleven signers to My petition to the Governor of Missouri    27th I walked 14 miles to the Missippi River crossed the ferry and walked into the city of  Memsis a stranger and alone, weary and hungry, without money, clothing rough, dirty, &  nearly ragged having walked through so much swamp, mud, water and brush, but in this  situation I called at one of the most respectiable taverns in the city kept By Mr Jackson  when the following Dialogue took place    W. Sir I am a servant of God a preacher of the gospel and without purse or scrip will you  Entertain me for the night and trust to God for your Pay.    J. How do I know sir but what you are an imposture, you dont look much like a preacher  what Denomination are you of.    W. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, it is true that you  do not know but that I am an imposter. (And no doubt but he believed it) I can show  you my licens and recommends to Preach the gospel    J. How do I know but what you forged them    W. It is true you do not know, but if you are not willing to take my word for it nor willing  to keep me for the night I will go my way and try Els whare    J. No sir you cannot go, give me your valise I will keep you over night and get you  a congregation and you must preach to us in order to prove to us whether you are  a preacher or not.    By this time I was satisfied that Mr Jackson believed me an impostor  I was alone yet I will confess that I did feel somewhat mischieveious I appeared as though 
 March 27th 1835    I was frightened and did not wished to be put to the test of preaching in order to prove me  a preacher this was the view of Mr Jackson untill he became highly Excited and was in for  having some fun. I was pleased to see it take this turn for I desired to preach to the   people they set a table and gave me a good supper in a large hall. Mr Jackson went out into  the city immediately and gave Notice to a certain class of men and women to come to his hall  to hear an imposture preach, and before I got through eating the room began to be crouded  with a class of men and women who were dressed in their silks, satins, and Broad cloth and as  soon as I finished my supper the table wdeparted over the heads of the people and Mr Jackson  gave me a chair in the cornor of the room placed a stand before me with a Bible & Hymn  Book upon it about a dozen men formed a half circle in front of me and I saw by  the countenances of the people that they expected some sport. I commenced my meeting  by reading a Hymn I asked the assembly to sing but no one sung I then knelt down  and prayed the men in front of me all droped upon their knees. When I arose I read  and read the ##Romans 11|11 chapter of Romans## and preached from the ##Romans 11:21|21 vers## "For if God spared not the  natural Branches take heed lest he also spareed not thee." I spent but few moments in talking  about the Jews But I turned to the assembly before me and as the spirit of God rested upon  me and revealed unto me the wickedness of their hearts I poured it out upon them and  told them of their wickedness whoredoms and abominations in vary plain terms  I do not suppose they ever had their sins as plainly pointed out to them as on this  occasion the men who sat in front of me droped their heads in the early part of my  discourse and I could not cketch their Eye afterwards, when I had thooroughly answered  my mind and had spoaken about an hour and a half I closed my meeting and not  a word was spoken by any person the room was instantly cleared and in two minutes  I was left alone. The Land Lady came in and and let me to my bed. I had not been  in bed but a few moments untill a croud of the men who had attended collected in the room  Joining me and dicused the subject of my being an impostor and my sermon and they decided  that I was not an impostor and it puzzled them much to understand how I should know so  much about their crimes being a stranger to them for I had told them much which they were  guilty off. They discussed this subject till near midnight when some Negroes came and broke  open their turkey roost and they all put out after the Negroes and this enabled me to go to  sleep. I arose in the morning and took breakfast. I then called upon Mr Jackson who  was in his store and I thanked him for his kindness and Entertainedment for the night  He said I was entirely welcome and if I ever came that way to called upon him and  I should be welcome to any thing his house afforded. I went my way and walked  March 28th 32 miles and was kindly entertained for the night and over Sunday by Mr  29 John A Logwood who is what is termed an Infidel by the Christian world I attended  a Presbytarian meeting in the forenoon the sermon was about 10 minutes long but devoid of sense,  meaning, light or knowledge this was in Fayett County I got 2 signers to my petition.    30th I walked 35 miles and spendt the night with sq[ui]r[e] Hardamand in Hardamand County I  was vary weary and went to bed early he had 2 sons returned home from colledge they had  a Ball and danced till 2 oclok in the morning so I did not get but little sleep 
 March 231st   Mr Hardamand was living in great splender, while taking Breakfast with him  with his table surrounded with Gentlemen and ladies and he was an Episcopalian and believed  much in music and danceing. He asked me if we believed in music and danceing I told him  we did not consider it an ordinanance really essential to salvation He said he did so he should  not Join our Church.

 silver thimble and some other small things. I took them into my  possession to preserve for his mother sister and friends. While looking over  his letters I found all that I had sent him carefully filed with other  communications from his family    After attending to the above affairs I accompanied  by my wife and Mr Ray, visited my brother's grave. His lot had  been cast among strongers and among them he fell and found a  early grave. No friend of his blood wor wife shared his grief or  joy in a family home nor droped with him there a ^co^mingled tear    And now Wilford and Phebe alone of all his family  marked his last dwelling place—his silent grave which looked  to us as we viewed it lonely indeed    I took some pebbles from his grave in memory  of the spot and ^returned^ with the reflection impressed upon my mind  that I had paid my last visit to my eldest brother without  spending a night under his roof and now my last visit to my  younger brother and only permitted to view his grave.    I wrote a letter to our parents in Farmington  giving an account of Asahel's death &c and wthen started nine  miles farther on my journey the same day.    We continued our journey and arrived in  Rochester Sangamon Co. Illinois on the 19th. Here strange  to say we unexpectedly found Ebenezar Cart^v^er and family  who left us at Utica N. P. [Y] and took the canal and lake.  They had stoped in Rochester to spend the winter. We called  to visit them for a few minutes not expecting to tarry; but  after calling we concluded to spend the night with them. During  the evening I had an interview with Elder Arnold Stephens.    I was informed that we could not cross the  Illinois River in consequence of the ice. I also learned that the  Saints in Zion Far West were suffering the severest persecution and  privation and that we could not travel through that country.    Under these combined circumstances we concluded  to stop for a season in the region of Rochester as doors were  opened to us and that too among Saints who had also taken  up their abode here for a season    Next day I procured a house 3 miles north of  Rochester in a grove of woods on the borders of a prairie on the  farm of Widow Branch. It was a double house and brother

Parley P Pratt's prophecy    As I began the year 1839 by labouring with my hands  for a season to support my family I suspended my Journal  for several months.    I will notice however several items noted at the  time: I wrote to my father-in-law my two brothers sister Eunice  and brother Smoot; and received one ^letter^ from my father-in-law  and one from my step-mother. My birthday I celebrated in  choping and spliting rails. and Finally I attended  Conference in Springfield    This conference of the Church in this district was held  in Springfield in the brick meeting house occupied by the Campbellites  Its commenced on Friday March the 8th. I attended it and  from this date another stage of my history began.    I became strongly impressed by the Spirit about  this time to go to Quincy Adams County Illinois to visit the  body of the Church which had fled to that place to find an  asylum for a season from the perilous persecutions which they  had been receiving from the inhabitants of the State of Missouri  I accordingly set out for Quincy which is one hundred and  twenty miles from Springfiled. I was accompanied by my  wife, child and brother and Sister Stephens. This was March 13th.    The 16th was a most interesting day. Reaching  Mr. Cleaveland's we once more had the happiness of greeting 
 three persons one of whom was a preacher.    On the following day still indisposed in health  I walked to Froom's Hill wrote a letter to ^my brother^ Aphek Woodruff and  spent the night with Elder Brigham Young at brother Benbow's  and the next day I occupied in writing to several of my friends in  America. There was a meeting that night at Froom's Hill when  Elder Young preached and we ordained Thomas Clark to the office  of Priest.    I walked with Elder Brigham Young to ^Dymock^  next day the 30th and had an interview with Elder Richards and  Kington with whom we spent the night. I received three letters  one from ^Mother^ Woodruff one from G. A. Smith and the other  from H Cordon.    My travels and labours continued and on the  5th of May I preached at Crowcutt and baptized 5 persons and  confirmed them one of whom was a preacher and on the 6th I  baptized and confirmed them and afterwards preached at  Dun's Close and walked to Taperdin where I baptized and  confirmed 4 making on this day one of whom was a preacher    The next day I walked to Malvern Hill  and preached at Colwall and on the following visited the Saints  and friends at Malvern Hill    In my walk to Colwall on the 9th, I had  a grand survey of Nature send the Power of the Creator while  standing upon the top of Malvern Hill elevated from 1200 to  1500 feet above the level. The surrounding country was before  my views stretched out many miles. Worcester City lies on the  North and is clearly seen in the prospect and Gloster on the South  with several large villages between laid stretch out before me  with Ledbury and other villages in the West and a fine beautiful  cultivated vale upon every hand    While standing upon the eminance of this  noted Hill beholding the grand and charming prospect before me  the thunders began to roll and the lightenings flash beneath  my feet in the vale below on which the rain descended in  torrents. The solemnity and granduer of the scene was  impressive as I stood on the Hill above the clouds surveying  the beautiful works of the Creator and his majesty in the storm. 
 sister Emma Smith who had taken up her abode for a season  with her children at the house of sister Cleaveland    Sister Smith had passed through a scene of  severe affliction since I last saw her and even at this time  Joseph her husband was in prison with other of the Saints    ^We^ I took dinner with sister Emma and afterwards  we rode to Quincy a distance of 4 miles    Here an interesting scene was met. I first called  at the house occupied by Father and Mother Smith the  parents of Joseph and also by his brothers Samuel and Carlos  and their families.    The street was the next scene and here  I met on every hand the Saints with whom I had been  formerly acquainted. There were Petty, Alexander, Smoot,  and their families from the South; and there were Brigham  Young, John Taylor, J. P. Green and most all the other  Kirtland Saints. Soon brother Jonathan Hale came  along with a shovel on his back and gave me a "How  do you do brother Woodruff?"    I saw so many old friends that I hardly  knew who to go home with first. Finally I concluded  to go home and spend the night with Brother Jonathan    We had an interesting time together in talking   over our travels upon the Islands of the sea. He also gave  me an account of the sufferings of himself and family and  of the sufferings of the Saints in Missouri during the  past winter.    The inhabitants of Missouri had become  transformed into a State mob with Governor Bogg at  their head. They came from time to time upon the  Saints in battle array. Our people were shot down by  them like wild beast others were butchered in cold blood  and some had their brains knocked out after they were taken  prisoners. The soldiers also shot down the cattle cows  and hogs of the Saints for the mere purpose of destroying  them.    At times the Saints stood in their own defence  and some of their enemies fell before them. In consequence  of this the Governor of Missouri issued orders for the 
 Sunday the 22nd, we preached at Mr Hubbal's to a full house and  at the close of the meeting brother Brown baptized him and his wife.    Elder Brown was now very anxious to continue his journey  down the Arkansas River to Littlerock cross the Mississippi  bottom and go into the State of Tennessee. This was an error  which many Elders have fallen into. As soon as doors have  been opened to them for the preaching of the Gospel and  the people have been ready to receive it they have removed  and left them. This was the case with us. We had  been there thirteen days and had met with much opposi-  tion in the beginning; but the Lord had sent judge-  ments upon our opposers; during our stay there had  been more than twenty deaths in the neighborhood;  our worst enemy had falled dead at my feet; my  dream had received its perfect fulfilment; prejudice  had given way and the people were ready to receive the  Gospel. Indeed they pleaded with us to stay, which had  we done we certainly should have built up a branch of  the Church in that place. I desired to tarry and labour  with this people as the Lord had opened doors for us; but  brother Brown would not consent and as he was an  Elder and I but a Priest I yielded much to the grief  of the people and in opposition to my own judgment.  Thus was it that on the twenty third we left brother  Hubbal's acompanied by brother Wright Akeman and  travelled twenty three miles across the Arkansas River  for the purpose of making a canoe to continue our  journey. This night we spent with Mr John Morse.    On the twenty-fourth we cut off twelve feet of  a Cottonwood tree which we also cut down for the purpose   of making our canoe. The tree was four feet in diameter.  This day was spent in diging out our canoe which we  finished on the next and then launched it put on a   good pair of oars and tied it to a tree.    We recrossed the river on the twenty-sixth and  returned to Brother Hubbal's to keep an appointment.  Here we spent the following day in laboring with our  hands. We did not eat the bread of idleness but spent  our leasure time in laboring whenever we were. This  I considered right. 
 Sunday April 10th I met a company at  Colwall at Jonothan Lucy's at 9 o'clock in the morning  and baptized seven two of whom were preachers. I  confirmed 12 and then preached at brother Lucy's dined  at Mr Holmes then walked over the top and across  Malvern Hill and preached at the Pale Horse thence back  again and preached at Benjamin Holland's on the North  side and from there to colwall where I stayed for the night    I extract from my Journal April 11th    A Visit  On The Herfordshire Beacon  South of Malvern Hill.    Having my mind prepared for a lonely walk  and meditation by reading Parley P. Pratt's Book upon  the "Eternal Duration of matter I commenced ascending theis  famed hill upon the south side and after ascending several  hundred feet I came to the top of an ancient entrenchment  about a mile in length reaching around all this part  of the Hill and meeting. Having ascended about one  hundred feet farther I entered another entrenchment like  the one below and after that another; and thus entrenchment  after entrenchment above each other until I reached  the top of the Hill which was nearly a flat or level surface  of circular shape and not more than from one to two  acres in size. Thus I stood upon this Beacon of   Hertfordsire more than a thousand feet in height surveying  the surrounding county from which I could fairly gaze  upon the tiers of entrenchments below me thrown up for  war nearly [blank space] in the times of the Romans  being their military defences and capable of holding hundreds  of thousands of fighting men. These hills are altogether bare  of timber but covered with grass which is grazed by  sheep and asses. Several acres on the S. W. side is  covered with rabbit burrows from which you could see 
 total extermination of Saints from the State.    To carry out these vile and inhuman measures he sent  a General after his own heart to execute his orders forthwith and  this was the cause of our people leaving the State of Missouri and  coming to Quincy.    The whole city of the Saints F Far West had   to surrender to the militia and the Presidency with about sixty  others were cast into prison and chains. They were all delivered  at the time of which I write excepting eleven persons.    The mob used every exertion to take the life of  Joseph and others; but through the mercy of God in whose hands  their lives were their enemies did not succeed in this.    David W. Patten one of the Twelve Apostles  of the Church of Latter-day Saints was one of the martyrs of  the persecution in Missouri in the winter of 1838. David   was one of the first Twelve chosen to bear the Keys of the  Latter-day Kingdom. He died strong in the faith that  he had boldy declared for the last seven years.    Sunday the 17th I held a council in  the morning with Elders Brigham Young and John Taylor  of the Twelve. We then met with the Church in Quincy  Brigham took the lead of the meeting.    There was a letter read from the committee  in Far West praying the brethren in Quincy to send teams  and money for the removing of fifty families from Far  West to this place. There was a contribution taken up  for this purpose of about 50 dollars and a number of teams  to go to the releif of the Saints in Far West.    The next day I spent in visiting the Saints  in Quincy. I called upon the family of brother Lyman Wight  who was still in prison with Joseph Hyrum and others in  Liberty Clay Co. Missouri. I here obtained my trunk which  had been in the hands of sister Wight for several years    On this day I also visited a number of   families who had camped on the bank of the river. They  were in a suffering condition in cold rain and mud and   some suffered for the want of food as well.    On the 20th I returned to Rochester and on  the 17th of the next month—April, I settled my family in 
 Feb 28th closed the week and the month an on this day we  preached at brother Hubbal's house    March 1st was my birthday and it being Sunday I preached  to a large congregation in the house as before. This was the last  time that we preached to the people in that settlement. They  were much grieved at our leaving them an departed  from the meeting with tears in their eyes. On this day I  was twenty-eight years of age    On the 2nd we took the parting hand of brother and  sister Hubbal and all our friends upon petty-John Creek  Accompanied by brother Wright Akeman we travelled to  the Dardanell's crossed the river and was kindly received  by Mr John Morse. This day I obtained seven names  to my pettition and travelled 23 miles.    Next day a Frenchman by the name of Sangrain  made us an offer to take us down the river in a flat-  bottom boat and to pay us wages if we would stay a few  days. This offer we accepted and spent the interval to  the 7th in chopping and splitting black walnut trails    Sunday 8th, I preached at the house of Mr Morse. On   this day brother Brown and I went to the top of an high  bluff at the Dardenells and engraved our names on the rock  This is the high station which the Osage Indians chose to  look for their enemies in time of war. It is several  hundred feet perpendicular from the base and it is said  that the Indians formerly flung their prisoners down  the precipiece where they were dashed to pieces. We threw  rocks down in experiment and found that by the great  force of their fall they broke off large trees in the valley  beneath.    We continued to labour for Mr Sangrain and saw  some dangerous reptiles while here such as the tarantula  and [blank] wich are very numerous in Arkansas;  but on the eleventh in consequence of low watter Mr  Sangrain informed us that he had abandoned all  idea of going down the river and that we must look  to our own recourses again. So we concluded to  proceed on our journey in our canoe. Embarking we  sailed twenty-four miles down the river to Petty-John  Mountain w[h]ere we stoped for the night with a Mr 
 scores of rabbits running about the ground. But I soon with-   drew my thougths from the agile little creature that sported upon  the hills to the solemner reflections of the past called up by the  entrenchments of battlefields around which told of bloody conflicts  between the natives and their invaders when England was young  Offering up a prayer upon the summit of the Hill to Him who  will redeem the earth from the curse of sin and prepare it for  the abode of the Saints of the Most High I returned to the Vale  reflecting upon the rise progress decline and fall of the nations  and empires of the earth and of the revolutions which must  still transpire before the winding up scene and the coming  of Christ to reign    At candle light I preached at Brother  John Allard's at Wind Point and was endowed with the  Spirit of God. I baptized and confirmed four.    12th A member of the Wesleanyan Methodist  came to me to enquire what she should Do to be saved. I  answered in the words of Jesus that she must be born of  water and the spirit. She received my testimony and  wished me to baptize her. I also called upon a woman  who kept the Toll Gate at Chancy's Pitch and preached  the word unto her. She received it gladly and desired  baptism at my hands. I then called upon Mrs  Sarah Stanton the house keeper of the splendid mansion  bearing the name of Brand Lodge. This lady was a  Wesleyan but she received my testimony and I administered  the ordinance of baptism to the three ladies refered to  above. I baptized them in a pond on the enclosed  grounds of Brand Lodge. I also confirmed them and then  walked to Keysandend's Street and held a meeting with the Saints  experienced a good time and confirmed 19 persons.    It seemed as though some would worship  me while they cried out—"Here is a man of Zion— the  Man of God that we have so long looked for. Who is   worthy to receive him into their house." I told them  to worship God for I was only his servant. I baptized  three and in all confirmed 22 on this the 12th day of May. 
 Quincy and prepared myself to accompany the Twelve to fulfill the  revelation and commandment of the Lord which required us to  take our leave of the Saints at Far West on the 26 day of April  1839 for the nations of the earth.    Previous to the narative of our journey to Far  West to fulfil the revelation and receive our ordination  to the quorum of the Twelve I will relate  One of my Chapters of Accidents  which occured in the above interval on the 3rd of April    [18 lines blank]    In company of three of the Twelve Apostles  I left Quincy April the 18th for the purpose of going to Far  West. Brother George A. Smith and Father Cutler was  also with us and George A. like myself was going up  to receive our ordination into the quorum of the Twelve   Brigham, Orson Pratt and John Taylor were the three  whom we accompanied.    On the fourth day of our journey passing  through Huntsville we crossed a 9 miles Prairie and found  the roads crowded with the Saints who were fleeing from 
 Barnet, Pope county    On the 12th, we rowed our canoe 50 miles and spent the  night at a place called Caldron. There were a number of  good houses built; but all were deserted, the place, it was  said being haunted. There was not a human being  but ourselves within miles of the place. Entering a  house that must have cost from three to four thousand dollars  supposed to be the worst haunted of the lot we built a good  fire, & rosted a piece of pork to eat with some corn doger  given us by a poor woman in the moring. We asked  a blessing eat our supper and then climbed into one  of the chambers as the stairs were broken down. It was  a cold night but we laid upon the floor with nothing to  cover us. I soon fell asleep without any regard to the ghosts  and dreamt that I called at my father's house and that  my stepmother made me up a good feather bed at my  father's house in Farmington. I thought that I laid down  upon it, had a good sleep and rested well. I did not awake  until sunrise when instead of finding myself upon a feather  bed in my parent home I was quite cold and chilly lying  on my back against a bare desolate haunted chamber wall  on the bank of the Arkansas River. Awaking brother Brown  we arose not having been disturbed either by ghosts or evil  spirits. We then prayed built a fire warmed ourselves,  eat what little we had left and then started down the  river after first going to the top of the high bluff and  taking a survay. We travelled 40 miles this day and spent  the night with Mr Samuel Blackburn Palaski County.    The next day we travelled to Little Rock, spent three  quarters of an hour in visiting the city then continued  down the river ten miles and was kindly received by a  Mr Isaac Jones at whose house we spent the night.  We had travelled this day fifty-three miles.    We spent the 15th with Mr Jones and preached the gospel  to him and his household; and on the following day leaving  our canoe with him we travelled ten miles up the river until  we reached the old military road leading from Memphis,  Tennessee to Little Rock, Arkansass. We took this road and  travelled eastwards though the road was through the Missis-  sippe swamp and was mostly covered with water through which 
 On the 13th I baptized one and then walked to  Ledbury where I received two letters one from Elder Turley  and the other from Parly P. Pratt, after which I walked to  Standly Hill and had an interview with Priest Cheese and  Barnes. Brother Cheese had baptized 15 since I last  saw him: also Priest John Parry had baptized 3 on  May the 3rd. (In his letter Elder Turley informed me  that he should be liberated from prison on the morrow)  Afterwards I walked to Froom's Hill and baptized 3 and  met the Church in company of Elder Brigham Young. We  had a good meeting and broke bread with the Saints. We  also at this tieme ordained John Cheese to the office of Elder  William Parsons and Joseph Pullen to the office of Priest  and Thomas Jinkins to that of Teacher. Besides these  we confirmed 9 souls and Elder Cheese baptized 2 and Thomas  Clark baptized 2 more    The day following I walked to Ledbury  with Brigham Young and from thence to Keysend Street  where I preached but amid much disturbance and as the  meeting was about breaking up the congregation was pelted with  rotten eggs    On the 15th I walked to Dymock and  spent the day with Elders Young Richards and Kington and  baptized one. I found that Elders Richards and Kington  had baptized fifty confirmed 1000 ordained ten Priests and  one Teacher since I last saw them. Brother Young  preached at brother Kington's where we spent the night  We spent a good time there and blessed the household and  laid hands upon the sick. The following day Elder  Kington baptized one and I spent the day with him but  brothers Young and Richards walked to Turkey Hall    Sunday the 17th was the aniversary    I met the Saints in company with Elders Young and Richards  In the morning I preached and in the afternoon brother  Brigham preached and while doing so opposers made much  disturbance being determined to break up the meeting 
 the mobocratic State of Missouri.    On the 25 we reached Far West and spent the night  at the house of brother Morris Phelps who was still in prison with  brother Parley P. Pratt.    The next day was indeed worthy of record. The  Lord had given a commandment to the Twelve to assemble upon  the building spot of the House of [the Lord] in Far West Caldwell Co Missouri  on the 26th day of April and their take the parting hand of the Saints  to go to the nations of the earth    But persecution had arisen to such an height that  about ten thousand souls of the Saints had been driven from  the State and the city of Far West almost made desolate and  waste. At the same time the Prophet Joseph and his council  with other Elders were in prison and had been under the sentence  of death several times because of their religion and they would  have been put to death had not the Lord preserved them  their lives were in His hands and not at this time in the  hands of their enemies. Yet there were about thirty five of  the Church killed at this time among whom was David W.  Patten of the Twelve Apostles.    These were the circumstances of that time  and moreover the Missourians had sworn that the revelation  above alluded to should not be fulfilled. Yet in spite of  all this we were now moving forthward to the building spot of  the House of the Lord in the city of Far West. The sacred spot  was reached the Council held the revelation fulfilled and after  taking leave of the Saints we returned thirty two miles and  camped for the night.    It being a matter of historical importance I will  here give from my journal of the day the minutes of  The Council at Far West;  (Held April 26th 1839)  Of The Twelve High Priests Elders and Priests.    Present of The Twelve:  Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt,  John E. Page and John Taylor. 
 we should have to wade. We walked twenty-two miles and spent the  night with Col. Blues. In Palaski County we obtained two signatures  to the petition    On the 17th we walked forty miles through mud and water  and spent the night with Mr Thomas Cribbin in Monroe County and on  the day following we walked eighteen miles and spent the night with Mr  James P. Kellean for whom we laboured with our hands the three  succeeding days.    Sunday the 22nd we preached at the house of Mr Kellean and  on the following day we walked forty miles through mud and water  and stayed for the night at the house of Mr Wm. S. Clonn at second  creek, St Francis County.    On the morning of the 24th, we started as usual through  the mud and water but I had not gone far before I was taken with  such rheumatic pains in one of my knees that I could not travell  My companion, Elder Brown was very anxious to make a speedy  journey to the river take a steamer up the Mississippi and hasten  to his friends in Kirtland. He therefore thought we had better  seperate as he could travel faster than I in my lame condition    I did not object to Elder Brown's proposition although I thought  that I should not have been willing to leave a lone companion in   the ministry in an open swamp without knowing whether he would  be able to walk far enough to meet again any companion more  acceptable than the wolves bears and alagators with which I was  surrounded    My fellow traveller left me sitting upon a log in the mud and  water without any food and twelves miles to the nearest house on my  road. I gazed upon him as he hastened out of my sight, then  knelt down in the mud and water and prayed unto the Lord in the  name of Jesus Christ in faith that he would heal me and open my  way that I might continue on my journey. The Lord heard my  prayer: His Spirit descended upon me and I was healed. I arose,  went on my way rejoicing, and, after walking fourteen miles was  kindly received by Mr John Caspber. At this place there was quite  a settlement and the people came together and filled the house.  I preached to them and bore a strong testimony of the work of  God revealed in our days.    It afterwards appeared that Elder Brown only gained  three miles upon me during the day; and in travelling those  in the evening he got lost in a thicket of brambles or Mohawk briars 
 but Elder Young arose up in the power of the Priesthood and  in the name of the Great God and according to the laws of  the land commanded order. Two of the brethren  went to the door to keep peace one of whom was Elder Richards  They were enabled to overcome the enemy and restore order  We administerd the Lord's supper and confirmed five.  We also ordained four Priests—namely, Thomas Brooks  William Simons Thomas Smith and Samuel Warren:  also one Teacher—James Baldwin.    A Feast Day With the Saints.    The 10th of May was an interesting day to me and  and my brethren who had come on the Lord's business from  our native land to establish the first mission of the  Church in the nations of Europe. It had been a custom  of the United Brethren to hold    But they were now members of the Church of Latter  Day Saints and had received the fulness of the Gospel  and as such they continued their old custom by brotherhood  Accordingly Brother Kington formerly the presiding  minister and Superintendent of the Church of United  Brethren and now their Presiding Elder as a part of the  Church of Latter-day Saints on this day once more prepared  a temporal feast for his flock.    The day began to us propi[tious]  At five o clock in the morning I met some friends at  Mr Joseph Hill's at Dymock and baptized three persons,  two of whom were Churchmen and the other a Wesleyan  From thence we walked to William Hart's    Elder Kington baptized seven  and Elders Brigham Young and Willard Richards  confirmed them. In a few minutes I baptized five  more who were confirmed as they came out of the water  We then returned to brother Kingtons and as we were  on the road we met another person, a woman who   also desired to be baptized. Elder Kington baptized

THE TEMPLE SPOT    The Council then proceeded to the building spot  of the Lord's House when the following business was transacted:    Part of a hymn was sung on the mission of  the Twelve; and then was    The foundation of the Temple recommenced    The hymn being sung Elder Cutler the Master workman  of the house rolled up a large stone near the South East  Corner as a recommencement of laying the foundation of  the House of the Lord agreeable to revelation.    Ordination of Willford Woodruff and  George A Smith to the Quorum of the Twelve    Those of the Twelve present were Brigham Young  Heber C. Kimball Orson Pratt John E Page and John Taylor  proceeded to ordain Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  to the quorum of the Twelve to fill the place of those who  had fallen. We had been previously nominated by the First  Presidency accepted by the Twelve and acknowledge by the  Church. At this time Darwin Chase and Norman   Shearer (who had just been liberated from Richmond 
 and tore nearly all the clothes off his body which took him nearly  the entire night to mend at the cabin where he stoped.    On the 25th I walked twenty miles, crossed St Francis  River got three signers to my petition and spent the night with  Mr Wm. A. Jefferson and the next day travelled fourteen miles  through the mud and water and preached at the house of Willis  Fields, Crittendon County. Here I obtained eleven more  signatures to my petition    March 27th. I travelled fourteen miles to the  Mississippi River crossed the ferry and walked into the  city of Memphis a stranger and alone—weary hungry and  without money—my clothing rough dirty and nearly  ragged, having walked through so much swamp water  and brush. But in this situation I called at one of the  most respestable taverns in the city kept by a Mr Jackson  between whom and myself the following dialogue took  place:    Myself: Sir I am a servant of God—a preacher of the ^Gospel^  and without purse or scrip—Will you entertain  me for the night?    Jackson: How do I know sir but what you are an impostor?  You don't look much like a preacher. What  denomination are you of?    Myself: I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints. It is true you do not  know but that I am an impostor; but I can  show you my licence and recomendation.    Jackson: How do I know but you forged them?    Myself: You do not and if you are not willing to take  my word for it I will go my way and try elsewhere.    Jackson: No sir y[ou] cannot go. Give me your valise. I  will keep you for the night and get you a  congregation and you must preach to us in  order to prove whether you are an impostor  or not."    By this time I found that Mr Jackson really beleived that  I was an impostor. I was alone yet must confess that I  felt somewhat mischevious. I feigned to appear as though  I was frightened and not wish to be put to the test: at which  Mr J. grew excited and I saw that he was in for fun. It 
 her. The Saints began to gather at 2 o'clock and by 5 p.m.  we had nearly one hundred Saints together to the feast prepared  for them. We had indeed that day a most interesting  and spiritual time as well as our social communion  in temporal things. Elder Brigham Young first addressed  the Saints and was clothed with the Spirit and power of  God. He then asked a blessing upon the food so  bountifully prepared. We then sat down to the table  and eat and drank with nearly one hundred Saints  who possessed glad hearts and cheerful countenances  Elder Richards remarked that he did not beleive that  there had ever been such a company of Saints prepared  in so short a time and who bid fairer for the   Kingdom of Heaven than the company then assembled  at least since the Church of Latter-Day Saints was  first organized.    A Church of Four Hundred  Raised up By Me  In Two Months & a Half    I trurly felt grateful to my Heavenly Father when  I reflected back upon the time when I first proclamed  the fulness of the Gospel in this region and began  to baptize such as received my testimony. Only two  months and a half a go since I came into the Hertfordshire  field of labour and now there was a Church raised of nearly  four hundred souls and the prospect of the work constantly  increasing.    After our feasting was over the  house was called to order by Elder Brigham who then  delivered a short address after which three were confirmed  by myself and Elder Willard Richards. The were also  ordained to the office of Elder Daniel Browett and to  the office of Priest John Smith John Davis James Morgan  Robert Clift John Gaily and William E. 
 prison where they had been confined for the cause of Jesus) were ordained  after us to the office of Seventies. We were ordained on the Chief  corner stone. The Twelve then offered up vocal prayer in the  following order:    Brigham Young Heber C Kimball Orson Pratt  John E Page, John Taylor Wilford Woodruff  George A Smith.    After this we sung [A] [blank]    Fulfilment of the Revelation    The Twelve then took the parting hand of the following   Saints agreeable to revelation:    Alpheus Cutler Elias Smith Norman Shearer Wm Berton Stephen  Markham Shedrick Roundy Wm C. Clark John W. Clark  Hezekiah Peck Dawin Chase Richard Howard Mary Ann  Peck Artimisha Grainger Martha Peck Sarah Granger Hyrum  Clark Theodore Turley and Daniel Shearer.    The Master Mason of the House Alpheus  Cutler then placed the stone before spoken of in its regular  position. After which in consequence of the peculiar situation  of the Saints he thought it wisdom to adjourn the work until  some future time when the Lord should open the way to proceded  with the building.    We had entered into a covenant to see the  poor Saints all moved out of Missouri into Illinois and we had  spared no means to accomplish this object and the Lord  had now given us the desires of our hearts in this thing    The last comapny of the poor who could be  moved were with us in our return from Far West. Parley P.  Pratt and Morris Phelps were still in prison and we were  under the necessity of leaving them for a season.    Early on the morning of the 27th we  commenced our journey from the Grove in upper Missouri where  we had returned and camped the night before. This was  32 miles from the city of Far West.    The company with us consisted of seven of the  Twelve, a number of the committee, and several other familes 
 suited my purpose for matters to take this turn for I was desirous to preach  to the people.    They sat me a table in a large hall and gave me a good supper  and large Mr Jackson went into the town immediately and gave notice  to a certain class to come to his house and hear an impostor  preach and before I had finished my supper the room began  to be crowded with men in broad-cloth and ladies in silks  and satins.    As soon as I had done my meal the table departed  over mythe heads of the people. My host gave me a chair in  the corner of the room and placed a stand before me with  a Bible and a hymn-book upon it. About a dozen of the  company formed a circle in front of me; and I saw by the  countenances of the people that they expected some fun.    Commencing my meeting by reading a hymn I asked the  congregation to sing; but no one sang. I then knelt down and  prayed and the men in front of me all droped upon their knees.  When I arose I read the ##Romans 11|11th ch. of Romans## and preached from  the ##Romans 11:21|21st## verse: "For if God spared not the natural branches,  take heed lest he also spare not thee"    I spent but a very few minutes in discourse about the  Jews but turned to the assembly before me and as the Spirit  of God rested upon me and revealed to my understanding the  wickedness of their hearts I poured it out upon them telling  them of their wickedness whoredoms and abominations in very  plain terms. I suppose they never had their sins so plainly  pointed out before. The men in front of me dropped their  heads in the early part of my discourse and I could not catch  their eyes afterwards. Having thoroughly satisfied my mind  and spoken about an hour and an half I closed the meeting  and not a word was spoken by any one. The room was instantly  cleared. In two minutes I was left alone and soon after the  landlady came in and lit me to bed.    I had not been in bed more than an hour before a crowd  of men who had attended the meeting collected in a room adjoining  mine and discussed the subject of my being an impostor or not  and also my sermon. Their decision was that I was not an  impostor and it puzzled them much to understand how I should  know so fully of their sins for I had told them much of which  they were guilty. The subject was discussed until near midnight 
 After our meeting was closed three more were baptized  The ordinance of baptism was administered by Priest  James Morgan who was baptized confirmed and ordained  on that and now officiated in one of the ordinances of  the Church. There was baptized and confirmed in all  that day nineteen and ordained one Elder and six Priests    On the following day Elders Young Richards  and myself went to Keysend Street where brother Young  preached and after the meeting I baptized four who were  confirmed by Elders Young and Richards as they came out  of the water.    May the 20th we walked to Wind Point and  brothers Young Richards and myself went on to the top of that  part of Malvern Hill called Herefordshire Beacon. Here we   united in prayer    And Held A Council.    We jointly felt that it was the will of God that Elder Brigham  Young should immediately go to Manchester to assist  in publishing a    Collection of Hymn Books  Of 3000 Copies.    and also to immediately print and publish    Three Thousand Copies of the Book of Mormon    for we had procured three hundred pounds for this purpose  and was anxious to have this book of God circulated  and the knowledge of the great work connected with its coming  forth published to all nations.    Returning to the Vale from the Hill we  took the parting hand of Brigham Young who stardted for  Manchester while Elder Richards and myself tarried and  preached at Wind Point; he baptized two and confirmed   one and I the other. I also ordained John Allard to the office  of Teacher.    On the netxt day we again ascended to the top  of the Herefordshire Beacon where we prayed together and spent 
 of the Saints. We continued our journey and crossed the  Mississippi River steam ferry at Quincy on the 2nd day  of May being five days on our road from the Grove.    The next day I had the unspeakable happiness  of visiting Joseph    The Prophet out of Prison    Myself and five others of the Twelve rode  four miles out of town to Mr Cleaveland's to see brother  Joseph. He had just been delivered from prison  and from the hands of his enemies and had returned  to the bosom of his family and friends. His brother  Hyrum Lyman Wight and two others of the brethren  who had been imprisoned with him had also just  received their deliverence with him. They had been  confined in prison about six months and had been  under sentence of death three times. But their lives  were in the hands of God and could not be taken by  their enemies.    They were now at home and we were in  their midst—all rejoicing together. Joseph was frank open  and familiar as usual & sister Emma was truly happy.  The Bishops of the Church were also present    Two years had rolled away since I had  seen the Prophet Joseph's face and absense had served  to strengthen the strong union that made us one in the  New and Everlasting Covenant. When we arrived he greeted  us with joy and after spending the day rejoicing together  our company returned to Quincy.    On the day following which was May 4th  A General Conference  commenced in the morning on the Presbyterian camp ground  two miles north of Quincy. Joseph was with the Church  again and was presiding over a General Conference. It was  an interesting time and it truly gave the Saints great joy to  have their beloved Prophet with them again. During the day 
 when some negroes came and broke open the turkey roost and they all   put after the theives and this enabled me to go to sleep.    In the morning I arose and took breakfast and then enabled  upon Mr. Jackson who was in his store and thanked him for his  kindness and entertainment. He said I was welcome and  that if ever I came that way again he wished me to call  upon him and that I should be welcome to all that his house  afforded. I then went on my way walked thirty-two miles  and was kindly entertained for the night and over Sunday  by a Mr John A Logwood who was termed an infidlel  by the Christian world.    Sunday, March 29th, I attended in the forenoon  a Presbytarian meeting. The sermon was about ten minutes  long; but its shortness was its best feature; for it was devoid  of sense knowledge and light. This was in Fayett^e^ County  Here I obtained two signatures to the petition.    Monday the 30th, I walked thirty-five miles and  spent the night with sqr. Hardamand in Hardamand Co.  Being very weary I went to bed early; but as there was a  ball that night in honor of the return of the sqr's two sons  from college and dancing until 2 o'clock in the morning I  got but little sleep. Mr Hardaman lived in great  splendor. At breakfast time next morning, when his  table was surrounded by ladies and gentemen, he asked  me if we beleived in music and dancing. He was an  Episcopalian and esteemed highly those amusements. I  replied in a spirit of pleasentry that we did not consider  it essential to salvation to which he returned in the  same spirit that he did and so should not join our  Church. Starting again on my jorney I walked twenty-  four miles and spent the night with Mr. Jacob Sipes and  preached in his house. This was in Madison Co.    April 1st, I travelled thirty miles, crossed  Mount Pinson and spent the night with David Beard  Henderson Co.; and on the next day I jorneyed through  Pleasent Grove Lexington and Maple Springs and spent  the night with Mr Wm. Morrell in Carrol County.    On the 3rd, I walked fourteen miles and stoped  at the house of brother Cade Crawley in Humphry's County  He was the first Saint whom I had met in Tennessee. 
 several hous in viewing the country around. Retur[n]ing to  the Valley Elder Richards baptized two persons. We preached  at Colwall that evening and there was also ordaind by us  on this day three Priests    On the 22nd I went over Malvern Hill  with Brother Richards and had a splendid view of the Vale  beneath. We stoped at the [blank] half way down  the hill and brother Richards engraved his name with  mine in the building. We went into the Valley and  dined after which we walked up to the Holy Well House  and drank of the Holy Water of great note which comes  out of Malvern Hill. After visiting several friends east  of the Hill we ascended to the top of Great Malvern which  is the highest peak of any part of the hill. Here we could  overlook all the hills and surrounding country. We bowed  down and offered up prayer unto God and then [nt]  by the west side and preached at Malvern Hill   We then walked to brother Jinkins at Moorend's Cross  where we spent that night and the next day and blessed  the family of our worthy brother and host.    Sunday the 24th I walked to Old  Starridge Common to attend a camp Meeting. I preached  in the morning and brother Willard Richards in the  evening after which we broke bread with the Saints  Three were baptized by me and we ordained three  Priests and one teacher    The next day was spent in looking  up the aged and infirm and we baptized as many  as would receive our testimony. I baptized six and  brother Richards confirmed them one of whom was  eighty years of age. We also preached at Dunn's Closs  and the next day at Bishops Froome    27th we baptized Charlotte Pullin  who had been a cripple from her birth and she received  a blessing after which we walked to Stokes Lane and  preached, confirmed ten persons into the church and  ordained two Priests and one Teacher and on the   20th I baptized 4 at Cricks Green who were confirmed 
 there was much important business accomplished and the conference  continued through the next day which was Sunday. At its close  a collection was taken up for the poor.    On the 6th of May I met with the Quorum of  the Seventies and after some counselling there were sixty ordained into  the seventies.    After this I with the Twelve and Bishops met  brother Joseph at the house of Bishoph Partridge where we again  had an interesting time. This ended the Conference.    Several brethren who attended this conference  had been wounded by the Missourian mob. I will here  relate  A Remarkable Incident of the Persecution    Brother Isaac Leany was in company with about  20 others at Hawn's Mills in upper Missouri when a large  armed mob fell upon them with loaded rifles and other  weapons and shot down seventeen of the Saints and murdered  them in cold blood.    Brother Leany fled from the scene for life and  while fleeing the mob poured forth a shower of balls upon him  which pierced his body through and through. He showed  me eleven holes in his body and there wasere 27 in his shirt  7 in his pantaloons and his coat was literally cut to rags.  One ball entered his body at one arm pit and came out at  the other; another ball entered the back and came out of the  breast and balls passed through each hip each leg and each  arm. All thiese wasere received while runing for life.    Strange in fact miraculous as it was all these  wounds with the addition of a broken rib from one of the balls   yet the speed of this brother was not lessened but he entirely  out-run his pursuers and saved his life.    This is as remarkable a case as ever recorded in  history of a man being literally riddled with balls besides having  his clothes almost cut to rags on his back with the shower of  lead and yet to outrun his pursuers and save his life just as  though only a few pees had been showered after him. He   was at this Conference now; and we can only acknowledge his  miraculous preservation to be by the power and mercy of God. 
 Elders David W. Patten and Warren Parrish had arrived  a short time before and had baptized over twenty persons in this  region. I was truly rejoiced to meet any of the Saints as I had  travelled several hundred miles alone; and I felt it a happy  privilege when after walking five miles next day I met Elder  Warren Parrish    Elder Parrish was travelling and preaching almost daily  baptizing such as would receive his testimony. He wished me  to join him in his ministerial labors and I did so; and we  labored together during a period of about three months travelling from  place to place and preaching nearly every day. We held several debates  administered to the sick and baptized twenty-six up to the date  of the 28th of June. In this interval I also wrote two letters to  the Saints in Zion, one to Arkansas and one to my parents.    On the 23rd of June we received a letter from Oliver  Cowdery containing a request for Elder Parrish to return to  Kirtland as he was one of the Seventies chosen. He also  stated that it was wisdom for me to remain in the South and  to take charge of the Churches which we had raised up. I  was instructed to labor in great humility and told that I  should lose nothing as there were other Seventies to be chosen  and that I should be remembered.    My Autobiography is not about to branch into my ordination  to the office of Elder and to take in an account of my labors  while holding that office. I will therefore close this chapter by  subjoining the following synopsis:    Synopsis of My Travels, Etc.    Travels As A Teacher:    I travelled while holding the office of Teacher from the 11th of April 1834  to the 25th of June following; from Richmond Oswego County New  York to Kirtland Ohio 336 miles; from thence to Clay County  Missouri in company with Zions camp 902, making a total of 1238  miles    As A Priest:    While holding the office of Priest I travell in Missouri 212 miles; in  Arkansas 656; in Tennessee and Kentucyky 950, making 1818 miles. 
 by Elder Richards. We then walked to Hope Rush and preached  where I baptized five more who were also confirmed by  brother Richards    On this day we visited the greatest curiosity  of Evergreen known in Europe or in any part of the world  so far as I can learn. This Evergreen was upon the farm  known as Hopton in the Hole in the Parish of Much Cowen  Herefordshire and owned by Richard Gardner. It was in a  circular form inclosing about one acre composed of Yew trees  growing out and standing in the midst of a border of Box  Brush. The yew trees were about in the form of a high  and well built hay or wheat stack and were suposed to be  several humdred years old. This Evergreen was surrounded by  a canal of water.    Our labours of the following day commenced  with my baptizing two at the creek who were confirmed by  Elder Richards and then we walked to Sucknell Hill and  preached after which I baptized three more one of whom was  a preacher and ordained one Priest    Next day Elder Richards baptized two  whom I confirmed and then we walked to Froom's Hill  to spend the night at brother Benbow's. Elder Richards  and myself had retired to rest for the night when brother  John Fidoe came in and brought us six letters three of which  were for myself. One of these were from Milton Holmes  George Town Massachusetts and another from my wife Phebe  Montrose Lee Co. Iowa. This was the first letter which I  had received from my wife since my arrival in England  Her letter contained much interesting news to me. She  informed me of    The Birth of My Son    Willford Woodruff  6 O'clock on the morning  of   March 22nd  1840. 
 Brother Joseph Young was among the number.  He also fled and though the balls fell around him like hail  stones yet was he delivered also.  [rest of page blank] 
 Meetings Held:    In Arkansas I held 14 meetings, and in Tennnesee and  Kentucky 56 making a total of seventy.    Baptisms:    I baptized eight persons and assisted in baptizing twenty  making twenty-eight.    Signatures for Petition:    I procured seventy-three signatures to the Petition to the Gov  of Missouri to redress the wrongs done the Latter-day Saints  by the Jackson Co. Mob: Ten was obtained in Missouri,  fifty-six in TArkansas and seven in Tennessee.    Letters and Subscribers    I procured four subscribers for the Messenger and Advocate  and wrote while a Teacher twelve letters and while a  Priest ten.    Chapter VII.    Introductory Remarks.    In continuing thye embodiment of my Journals in the form  of history I do not design to make it a mere diary. In  describing my journey and the incidents thereof I followed  a consecutive daily detail and shall adopt the same form  at times hereafter when it appears most suitable but as in  general one days record must be very similar to those  of many days so as a general rule I shall not follow a  diary form. My journals will show that as a rule  every day was spent in the active performance of  ministerial duties in daily travels and daily preaching  from place to place. I shall only note in this history  that which contains some leading incident or which has  a variation worthy of notice. 
 One of the letters received by us was from Brigham  Young at Manchester informing us that the first No of the    Millennial Star  was published and that the    Hymn Book and Book of Mormon  would soon be    In Type    Another of the letters was from Sister Richards and one  also from Elder Whitehead and there was so much glorious   news that sleep was driven from our eyes for the night. I   felt more like shouting Hallelujah.    According to appointment Sunday the  31st of May we attended a camp Meeting at Froom's Hill  when I preached in the morning on the authenticity of  the Book of Mormon after which we went to the pool  where I baptized 12 and Willard Richards confirmed  them at the water's side. Elder Richards preached in the   afternoon when when we administered bread and wine to   the Saints and then about one hundred of us went to  the water when two more were baptized by Elder Cheese.  Two of those baptized this day were preachers.    June 1st I baptized 9 and Elder Richards  confirmed them and we then walked to Ledburey and preached  The churches in Herefordshire now numbered four hundred   and two souls. I answered Milton Holmes' letter and the  next day wrote to Elder John Taylor and received    No I of the Millenial Star    On the 3rd of June I wrote to Phebe. This day    A Notable Miracle    was wrought upon the person of sister Mary Pitt at Dymock  She had been confined to her bed six years with spinal disease  which mostly deprived her of the use of her feet and ancles 
 My Ordination to the Office of Elder.    Sunday June 28th 1835 Elder Warren Parrish preached his  farewell address to the Eagle Creek Branch of the Church. At the   close of his discourse he laid his hands upon my head and  ordained me to the office of an Elder in the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints and appointed me to preside  over the Southern Churches. He also ordained Caswell  Medlock a Deacon in the Eagle Creek Branch. I wrote a  Recommend for Elder Barrish to the Church in Kirtland  singed by the male members in this place. We partook  of the sacrament at this meeting which we closed by  singing a farewell song. I then rode in company of  Elders Warren Parrish and Calvin H. Nickolson to brother  Medlocks. I received the following  Elder's License    This certifies    that Wilford Woodruff has been received into the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, organiszed on the  6tth day of April 1830, and has been ordained an Elder  according to the rules and regulations of said Church, and  is duly authorized to preach the Gospel and act in all the  ordinances of the House of the Lord, agreeable to the authority  of that office:    Given under my hand by the voice of the Eagle Creek  Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints, on the 28th day  of June 1835,    Elder Warren Parrish.    Humphry's County, Tennessee.    July 2nd: After preaching at the house of brother Otlay's we  organized a Branch of the Church called the Chalk Level Branch  and having on the 3rd crossed Tenneessee River and passed  through Reynoldsburg to Col Rutherford's I preached at his  house on the 5th and baptized one person and on the 6th returned  to brother Otlay's on which day Elder Parrish baptized three in  Henry County. 
 She had not walked for eleven years only with the use of crutches  Elder Young and Richards with myself laid hands upon her and   rebuked her infirmity and her ancle bones received strength and  she now walked without the aid of crutch or staff.    The days following I preached at Bran Green and  Haw Cross and on the Sunday according to appointment I met a  congregation at Coars Lawn and held a camp Meeting. There was  a large congregation of various denominations Aafter the meeting  we repaired to a house and broke bread. Eight were confirmed  and one baptized by Bro Spires.    The next day I walked to Deerhurst and preached  and at night I dreamed I saw a large church on fire. The steple  which was high was in flames. Several men were in the belfry  trying to save some part of the building with ropes pullies and   chains but they were soon obliged to flee for their lives and   much of the surrounding country was on fire. I dreamt that  I was on a large horse and rode out of the way.    On the 9th I attended the funeral of brother  Nathan Roberts. I sung a hymn and prayed before the body  was conveyed to the grave. I bless the children of the widow  and endeavoured to comfort her. I also baptized six and  confirmed them blessed eleven children and laid hands on  four for the healing of the sick. Afterwards I walked from  Deerhurst to Apperly and preached and on the next two  days preached at several places and baptized one and blessed a   number of children.    June 12th I walked to Dymock and  had an interview with Elder Richards who had just returned  from the south part of Herefordshire. He had built up a  church of eleven members and ordained one Teacher among  them. We preached at brother Kington's confirmed 2 and healed  one who was sick. Elder Richards wrote an article for the  Millennial Star.    Next day we held a council at brother  Kington's preparatory to a conference. We received a letter  from Brigham informing us of the    Emigration of Forty Saints  from Liverpool 
 On the 7th I rode [to] John Jackson's and preached at his house. There  had been an appointment made by a mob for the purpose of disturbance  but as sickness fell upon some and fear upon others they gave  up their designs.    Having filled up the interval to the 18th with the usual  labors I rode on this day 15 miles to Lewis Clapp's. Here I  received Elder Asa Dodd's credentials according to counsel sent  me from Kirtland and also ordained Benjamin Clapp  a Teacher.    On the next day I preached at the School House follow-  ing a Campbellite preacher. I was much threatened before  the meeting; yet I was not disturbed. In the evening  after preaching at Mr Clapp's I baptized two and on the  following day I rode to Clark's River and preached in the  afternoon and evening to a large congregation of priests  and people. One priest opposed me: the rest were silent    Returning to Col. Copeland's on the 22nd I  again met Elder Parrish from whom I parted on the 16th.  He had since then baptized five persons. This day I  received a letter from my parents.    I rode in company with Elder Parrish on the 23rd  for the last time, to the mouth of Sandy. Here he preached  for the space of three hours to several hundred persons and  baptized one. At the close of the baptism I took the parting  hand of Elder Parish and Seth Otlay who was to accompany  him to Kirtland. This placed me under great respon-  sibility having the care of all the churches in Kentucky  and Tennessee; for I was on a circuit of some two   hundred miles and travelling and preaching daily. This   resposibility filled my mind with solemn reflections and  I prayed to the Lord to give me grace equal to my day  After parting from these brethren I rode 20 miles to Col.  Copeland's where I spent the night.    From date of 23rd of July to August 15th I had  been travelling and preaching; had heard of much excitement  caused by fears of the insurrection of the blacks in the  South; had administered to the sick baptized three  and obtained two subscribers for the Messenger and  Advocate. On this day riding to Mr Taylor's I was under  the necessity of swiming Bloody River. The water was so 
 MINUTES OF A CONFERENCE    held at Gadfield Elm    Wostershire England  June 14th 1840    The Preachers and members of the Bran Green and  Gadfield's Elm Branch of the Froom's Hill Circuit of the  United Brethren met at the Gadfield's Elm chapel  pursuant to previous notice. The meeting was called to  order by Elder Thomas Kington. Willard Richards was  chosen President and Elder Daniel Brewett clerk.    The Church of the United Brethren  transformed to a Conference of  the Church of LATTER DAY SAINTS.    The meeting opened by prayer offered up by Elder  Willford Woodruff after which remarks were made by the  President respecting the business of the day and the necessary  changes to be made. It was moved by Elder Thomas Kington  and seconded by Elder Browett that this district be hereafter  known by the name of    The Bran Green & Gadfield Elm Conference  of the Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S.    organized and established by the will and commandment of   God in the U.S of America  on the 6th day of April A.D 1830 
 high and the banks all overflown that I could not see the  fording-place and as my horse went off the bank he plunged into  a hickery-tree-top and became entangled in the limbs and well-  nigh drowned. I had my valice fastened to the saddle and a  walking-cane in my hand which I did not wish to lose. It was  with difficulty that I got my horse extricated but when he got at  liberty he swam to the bank on the opposite side and I also had  to swim. The horse reached the dry land first and waited for   me. I then mounted and continued my journey to brother  Taylor's and on the next day, Sunday 16th, I met with the Saints  and partook of the sacrament with them. I also wrote a letter  to my brother Ashel H. Woodruff    During the period from the 16th of August to the 21st  of September I continued as usual travelling and preaching, several  times of which was at the Academy of Col. Copeland where I had  frequently preached to large congregations. I had also administered  sacrament received a letter from Elder Parrish baptized Mary   Clapp and ordained James Young to the office of Deacon    On the 21st I rode 10 miles to Paris and wrote a  letter to John Whitmore and read the Debate of Campbell and  Owen. The next day I travelled 15 miles and preached and  on the next rode to brother Otlay's and had a pleasent inter-  view with him. He had just returned from Kirtland and  brought a letter from Warren Parrish also the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants which was a present from Oliver  Cowdery. The day following I spent in reading it and  found it a precious gift from heaven    In the interval to the 18th of October I baptized 3  and obtained subscribers to the Messenger and Advocate  and at about the time at which the date of my history  has reached I made quite an inroad with the Gospel among  the Campbellites.    Sunday October 18th I rode 12 miles to Clark's River   preached in the meeting house and afterwards held a debate  with a Campbellite priest. I also preached at night on the  authenticity of the Book of Mormon. The next day while  preaching the spirit of God rested mightily upon me and  on the one following I baptized three Campellites one of whom  was a Deacon of that sect. I then rode 12 miles and preached  at the house of Mr Joseph Greenwood who was 81 years old 
 This was carried unanimously. It was then moved by  Willford Woodruff and seconded by Thomas Kington that  William Jinkins be ordained an Elder and William Coleman  William Pitt Joseph Ferkins and Robert Harris to the office  of Priest and George Burton James Palmer and William  Leveridge Teachers who were then all ordained under the  hands of Elders Richards and Woodruff. On motion of  Elder Kington seconded by Elder Woodruff the following  arrangements of the churches were made    Branches Comprising the Conference                 Kilcott   under the care of Priest James Palmer      Dymock    Priest Robert Clift      Twigwarth    Priest John Hill      Haw Cross    Priest William Simmon        Bran Green    Priest William Coleman        Ryton    Priest Thomas Brooks      Lime Street    Priest John Smith      Deerhurst    Priest Charles Hays      [Deerhurst] assistant Priest Thomas Smith      Apperly    Priest John Vernon      [Apperly] assistant Priest William Baylis      Norton    Priest John Arlick      Leigh    Priest John Spires      [Leigh] assistant Priest John Davis      Gadfield Elm    Priest Thomas Oaky                  South side of the River Severn        Under the charge of Elder. D. Browett      North Side of the River Severn      Under the charge of Elder William Jinkins      The Churches comprising the      Conference under the care of Elder Thomas Kington       (Meeting adjourned)    In the afternoon the cConference reassembled when  the sacrament was administered to a large congregation  and remarks on various subjects were then made by the President 
 [17 lines blank]  I spent June 27th in council with the Presidency  and Twelve. We had an interesting day. Joseph was  President of the council.    After making an humble acknowledgement   brother Orson Hyde was restored to the Church and  the quorum of the Twelve in the full fellowship by an  unaminous vote of the council    Among the vast number of the keys of the   Kingdom of God Joseph gave to the Twelve the following  for their benefit experience and travels in the flesh:    How to detect the Devil,  When transformed into an Angel of Light!    The Prophet said that when an angel of God  appears unto man face to face in person and reaches out  his hand unto the man and he in thaking hold of the angel's  hand feels a substance the same as one man would in  shaking hands with another then may he know that  such a personage is an angel of God. The person who   receives a visit from a being of this order should place all 
 and a revolutionary who had served under George Washington  His wife Elizabeth was 93 years of age and well remember  Braddocks army. Another mark of interest to me was to  see so venerable a lady buisy carding in which branch of  manufacturing industry she still employed her aged hands.    On the 21st I rode to brother Clapp's and preached  at the evening at his house from the ##Psalm 50:3-5|L Psalm—3, 4, and 5## verses.  At the close of the meeting I opened the door for baptism  when eight came forward and gave me their hands, all  of whom were Campbellites except one and he was a  baptist. We repared to the water and the Spirit of the  Lord rested upon us while I administered the divine  ordinance to them. Three of the men also led their  wives down into the water and they were baptised.  This day I obtained two subscribers for the Messenger  and Advocate and two more in the several following  days. I also wrote on the 24th a letter to John  Whitmore which was published in the Messenger and  Advocate page 237.    While holding service at the house of brother  West November 3rd two had the gift of tongues and on  the 14th of the same month at the house of brother Camp  the Spirit of God rested upon us and the signs followed  the beleivers according to the promises made by Christ  and his ancient Apostles and renewed in these  Latter-days. At this date I had the satisfaction of  introducing two into the Church through the ordinance  of baptism and five more on the following day were  in like manner added to the Church of God and  thus the work grew and florished daily.    After baptizing the five persons on the 15th  we mounted our horses to ride to Clark's River in company  with five brethren and two sisters. Among the number  were Seth Otlay and Benjamen F. Clapp. There had  been a hard storm of rain which had swollen the  streams. When we came to the one we had to cross  we found we could not without swiming our horses  and as there were females with us it was considered  dangerous to make the attempt. We tried to head  them sufficient to ford and while doing so the 
 Ten members were confirmed and seven children blessed under  the hands of Elders Woodruff and Kington. Elder Daniel Browett  was appointed to represent the Gadfield's Elm conference at the  General Conference at Manchester and ordered that the clerk  present to the Presiding Elders for safe keeping and also to the General  Conference a copy of the minutes of this. Upon motion of  President Willard Richards the conference was adjourned until  the 13th of September of the same year.    After the close of the conference the Elders and  other officers present met in council and arranged that a weekly  council of the Priesthood should be held alternately on the  South and North sides of the River Severn to commence at  Leigh on the 26th of June and organized the same by appointing  Elder Daniel Browett President and John Hill clerk of these  weekly councils of Priesthood on the South side. The  North side was ^also^ organized by the appointment of Elder  William Jinkins President and John Smith clerk: the  first council to assemble on the 9th of the next July at  Turkey Hall. After other business of a minor nature the  council adjourned and it is worthy of remark that there had  not been that day either in conference or council a dissenting  voice.    June 15th we walked to Dymock and   I continued to Ryton and preached and then returned to  Dymock and the next day went to Lugwardine and  preached at the house of the father of Elder Philip Green  when three were baptized by Elder Green, and by Elder  Richards and myself confirmed eleven and ordained two  Priests    The following day I baptized six and  Willard Richards confirmed them after which we walked  to Marden and preached at the house of William Jay and  baptized and confirmed four. This day we baptized 10  and confirmed them blessed four children and laid hands  upon and healed seven who were sick    The day after I baptized five which  we then confirmed. We also ordained Francis Burnet  to the office of Priest blessed 6 children administered 
 confidence in him. Such angels are Saints with their resurrected  bodies.    But if a personage appears unto a man as an angel of  light and offers him his hand and the man when he essays to  take hold of the proffered hand feels nothing nor senses any substance  he may know that this is the Devil; for when a Saint whose  body is not resurrected appears unto a man in the flesh he will  not offer his hand for this would be against the law given  him. In keeping in mind such keys of knowledge we may  be enabled to detect the Devil that he deceive us not.    The following day I let the Bishops have my forty  acre lot in Far West Missouri. I deeded it to a man by the name  of Blesens in payment of the landing point four miles south of  the garrison in Montrose.    The time had now arrived for us who were appointed  to leave our families and the bosom of the Church and start upon  Our Mission to the Nations.    On the 2nd of July the Presidency—Joseph and  his Council came across the river to Montrose to spend the day  with the Twelve to bless them and their families before they  left for other nations.    In the forepart of the day we rode four miles  down the river to see the place called Blesens-point where the  Saints were expecting to build    Joseph pronounced it good and we  returned and the whole company dined at my dwelling consisting  of about twelve persons.    After dinner we all assembled for meeting   at the house of Brigham Young. Hyrum Smith having  opened the meeting by prayer the Presidency laid their hands upon  my head and sealed a blessing upon me. President Rigdon  was the speaker in setting apart and blessing me. They also  set apart and blessed Elders George A Smith and Turley  Sisters Young and Taylor with my wife were likewise blessed    In our blessings for our mission to Europe  we received the promise that if we were faithful we should 
 darkness of night with a hard storm of wind and rain overtook  us and we became lost in the thick woods. We had neither fire  light nor road but was in darkness rain mud and tree-tops  We crossed the stream about 20 times and had [it] not been for  our horses and the females in our company we should have  appeared far more like fishermen than travellers. I thought  of Paul's perils by water. [##Acts 27##] But the Lord was merciful to  us; for while we were in the wood groping as the blind  for the wall, suffering under the blast of wind and rain,  a light suddenly shone around about us without aid either  of the sun moon or stars and it revealed to us that we  were in danger of killing both ourselves and animals by  riding off steep bluffs. We were on the edge of a deep gulf when  the light appeared which continued with us until we found  a house and were put on the right road. The light then  disappeared and the darkness returned: yet we reached the  house of brother Henry Thomas at 9 o'clock in the evening  without having received any hurt either to ourselves or horses.  We were five hours in the storm and had ridden twenty  miles and crossed creeks about as many times as the miles  we had travelled. All were impressed with the care  of Providence towards and we felt to return the Lord thanks  for our preservation and his blessings so signally marked  in our history of that day. This surely deserves notice  as one of the episodes of my life and an instance of  deliverance from the Lord in a time of need.    Two days after the above remarkable incident  I was called out in the night to view the signs in the  heavens. There were three clouds seen having the appearence  of fire and blood. One was in the West another in the  East and the third in the North, each appearing about the  size of an acre of ground. They arose from the horizon  to the zenith and frequently changed their position. This   was November the 17th. On this day also I had baptized  one, ordained Daniel Thomas a Teacher and organized the  Damon Creek Branch of the Church; afterwards I rode 12 miles  and the place where at night I witnessed the above singular  phenomon. Dece    December 1st, I spent in writing to John Whitmore  and Warren Parrish at Kirtland and on the next day met 
 to two who were sick and then walked to Shucknell Hill  where we preached and had an interesting time. Elder  Willard Richards spoke from the text "If the Lord be God  serve Him." The power of the Priesthood rested upon him  and the principles of eternal truth were presented so plain that no  opposing power could stand them. After he closed I arose and  bore my testimony to what the congregation had heard    The church minister of the parish had  sent a spy to our meeting to carry him word concerning  what was preached. As soon as the meeting closed  I put my hand upon his shoulder and asked him  what he thought of our doctrine and he replied "I  think it is of God." He appeared astonished when  he left the house. Almost every person with whom  I conversed said that they wished to be baptized  as soon as an opportunity offered. Several were  baptized by Elder Green after their return home  and one after the meeting by Priest Williams.    We had baptized on this day  six persons and confirmed them ordained two Priests  blessed thirteen children and healed two who were sick  The night was spent at brother Williams.    On the morning of the following  day I arose early and baptized and confirmed one  and a number of others soon came to us and requested  to be baptized    We immediately walked to the River  Lug but being hindered for a short time in looking   for a place suitable for the purpose a man by the  name of Pitt up to us filled with the devil and at  the head of a mob and commanded us not to  baptize in that river and threatened us much if we  did so. Elder Richards preached to him and warned  him to repent but the Devil raged so much in him  and his company that we deemed it wise to pospone  the administeration of the ordinance    We retired and went our way but  this wicked wman and the mob followed us shouting 
 return to the bosom of our familes after having great success  upon our mission and many souls as seals of our ministry.    Brother Hyrum Smith afterwards gave us  some beneficial counsel relative to our mission and advised  as best to only preach the first principles of the Gospel    Joseph then arose and gave to us some  of the precious things of the Kingdom in the power of the Holy  Ghost. He said in substance what I here record in  the following synopsis of  Joseph's Charge to the Twelve!!    "Ever keep in exercise the principles of mercy  and be ready to forgive your brotherren on the first signs  of repentance and his asking forgiveness; and should we  even forgive our brother or our enemy before he ask it our  Heavenly Father will he equally as merciful unto us. We  ought also to be willing to confess all our sins and keep  nothing back.    Let the Twelve be humble and not be  exaulted and beware of pride. Seek not to exalt yourselves  one above another nor to excel one another but act for   each other's good. We should honorably make mention of  each other's name in our prayers before the Lord and before  our fellow men and not backbite and devour our brother.    Why will not man learn wisdom from  precept and example? Why at this late age of the world  must we be obliged to learn everything we know by sad  experience?    Must the new ones who are chosen to fill  the places of those who are fallen of the quorum of the Twelve  begin to exalt themselves until they get so high as to tumble  over and have a great fall? Must they do so and afterwards  go wallowing through the mire and be left in darkness & Judas  like be delivered to the buffatings of Satan as several of the  Twelve before? [##Matthew 27:3-5##] Or will they learn wisdom from experience  and be wise? O God give them wisdom and keep them   humble I pray! 
 Elder E. F. Wells who became a co-laborer with me for a short  time.    On the 8th I wrote letters to my father and mother  and my brother Asahel H. Woodruff    After preaching at the house of Benjamin L. Clapp,  on the 19th, I baptized five persons, four men and onea  woman. One of the number was a Campbellite preacher.  The next day at Clark's River where I preached a mob of  fifty men gathered against me. It was led by a  Baptist priest; but after questioning me upon one point  the leader advised them not to lay hands upon any   man for his religious principles. The advise was good  and it was taken. I preached again at night and  baptized three persons.    The last day of the year I spent at brother  Taylor's when I perused my journal and made up a   summary of my travels and proceedings during 1835  commencing January 13th. This summary and my  closing reflections of the year I will give here at the end  of this chapter, copied from the "first book" of the first vol.  of my journals.    Miles Travelled:  I travelled during the year th[r]ee thousand two hundred  and forty-eight.    Meetings Held.  I held one hundred and seventy meetings.    Churches Built Up.  I planted organized and built up three Churches    Number Baptised  I baptized forty-three, of whom three were  Campbellite Priests.    "Messenger and Advocate"  For the Messenger and Advocate I procured twenty  subscribers and for the reprinted "Star" two.    The Petition  I obtained seventy-three signatures to the Petition to  the Govenor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done  the Church by Jackson County mob.    Letters  I wrote eighteen letters and received ten. 
 hooting and yelling, but the Saints were strengthened seeing  they were not of the world and therefore the world hated  them and we went on our way rejoicing that we were  persecuted for the Gospel's sake.    Afterwards we walked to Froom's Hill  and found brother and sister Benbow zrejoicing exceedingly  in the Lord. I baptized one person here and administered  unto one sick and tarried at Brother Benbows    June 20th was spent in company  of Elders Richards & Kington in arranging for the  Froom's Hill conference. It was an exceedingly busy  day for we had much buisness to attend to. Among  the duties of this day I baptized eight persons and  we confirmed fourteen administered to the sick and  blessed three children. The power of God was in the  midst of the people and bringing about a marvellous  work in this part of the land. There were now  five hundred souls number in church in the   Herefordshire mission.    [FIGURE]  MINUTES  of the  FROOM'S HILL CONFERENCE  held at  STANDLY HILL CASTLEFROOM HEREFORDSHIRE  ENGLAND,  JUNE 21st 1840    The Preachers and members of the Froom's Hill  circuit of United Brethren met at the house  of Elder John Cheese on Standly Hill Herefordshire England  June 21st A.D. 1840 at 10 o'clock a.m. when the meeting  was called to order by Elder Thomas Kington and Elder  Willford Woodruff was chosen President and Elder John   Benbow clerk of the meeting 
 "When the Twelve or any other of the witnesses of  Jesus Christ stand before the congregations of the earth and preach  in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and the people  are astonished and confounded at the doctrine and shall say that  man has preached a powerful discourse—a great sermon, then  let that man or those men take care that they do not ascribe the  glory unto themselves but be careful that they are humble and  ascribe the praise and glory to God and the Lamb for it is  by the power of the Holy Priesthood and the Holy Ghost that  they have the power thus to speak.    What art though O man but dust and from  whom dost thou receive thy power and blessing but from  God! Then O ye Twelve notice this key and be wise for  Christ sake and your own souls sake.    Ye are not sent out to be taught but to teach.  Let every man be sober and vigilent and let all his words be  seasened with grace. Keep in mind also that it is a day of warning  and not of many words.    Act honestly before God and beware of Gentile  sophestry such as bowing and scraping unto men in whom you  have no confidence. Be honest open and frank in all your  intercourse with mankind.    And O ye Twelve and all Saints profit by  this important key which I now give you: In all your trials  troubles and temptations afflictions bonds imprisonment and death  see to it that you do not betray heaven that you do not  betray Jesus Christ that you do not betray your brethren and  that you do not betray the revelations of God whether in the  Bible Book of Mormon Doctrine and Covenants or any of the   word of God. Yea in all your kickings and flounderings  see to it that you do not this thing lest inocent blood be found  in your skirts and you go down to hell!    We may ever know bythat there is danger of  our being led to a fall and apostacy when we give way to the  Devil so as to neglect the first known duty but whatever  you do, never betray your friend!"

 Debates  I held three debates or answered when publicly opposed.    Mobs  Three companies in the form of mobs gathered against me  yet I suffered no harm.    Members Confirmed.  I confirmed into the Church thirty-five persons.    Excommunications  I expelled seven from the Church but not while hope remained    Reflections of the Year.    "The accobefore mentioned is an account of my proceedings of  the year 1835, which has borne to heaven its report of me  and of all men. Could the year not have borne more  welcome news? Ah! but it cannot be recalled. The sable  shades of night already speaks the departure of 1835 and the  queen of night is showing forth her silver light to welcome the  dawn of 1836 which approaches us in calm to go out in a  storm! O momentous and important year which will hurl  thy millions to the tomb, shake kingdoms and bespeak a  God in Israel! When the Lord speaks who can but prophesy!  O God enable my heart and hands to be clean for a year  to come!"    Thus ends the year 1835 and the eighth chapter  of my history commences with a new year to me even  more eventful than the one here closed.    [FIGURES]    Chapter VIII    Nothing particular beyond the daily duties of the ministry occurred  in the year 1836 until Feb 26th when we held our first conference  of the Southern Churches at which I presided. Upon a vote being  Btaken for their ordination I proceeded to ordain Abraham O. Smoot  Benjamin Boydstun Elders; Daniel Thomas and Benjamin Clapp  priests and Henry Thomas and John Camp Deacons: after which  seven Branches were represented comprising 103 members seven of whom  were scattered.    Towards the middle of AprMarch Elder Abraham O Smoot  commenced travelling with me to preach the Gospel 
 After prayer by Elder Willard Richards and remarks  by the President of the meeting it was moved by Elder Kington  and seconded by Elder Benbow that this circuit hereafter be  known by the name of the Froom's Hill conference of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints organized and   established by the will and commandment of God in  the United States of America on the 6th of June A.D. 1830    It was moved by Willard Richards and   seconded by Thomas Kington that Thomas Clark James Hill  Charles Price and Samuel Jones be ordained Elders: also that  John Jones John Morgan Joseph Shinn Samuel Badham  Henry Jones John Dyer & James Baldwin be ordained Priests:  also that Robert Hill James Shinn George Brook's and James Watkins  be ordained Teachers (carried unanimously) and these brethren were  ordained under the hands of Elders Richards and Woodruff. The   following arrangements of branches and presiding officers were  then made in the organization of the conference:                 Froom's Hill under the care of Priest John James      [Froom's Hill] assistant Priest John Morgan      Standly Hill   under the care of Priest John Parry      [Standley Hill assistant   Joseph Pullen      [Standley Hill Teacher   Robert Hill      Ridgway Cross   under the care of Priest James Barnes      Moor End Cross   under the care of Priest William Possons      [Moor End Cross] assistant Priest William Jinkings      [Moor End Cross] Teacher   Thomas Jenkins      Colwall   care of Priest   Jonathan Lucy      Pale house   care of   Thomas Jones.      [Pale house] Teacher   William Williams      Ledbury   care of Priest John D ^Price^      [Ledbury] assistant   Joseph Firkins      Key'send Street   care of Priest Samuel Warren      [Key'send Street] assistant Joseph Shinn      [Key'send Street] Teacher James Shinn      Wind Point   care of Priest James Baldwin      [Wind Point] Teacher   John Allard      Waferwood Common    Priest George Allen       Rough Leaso  Birchwood  Tunbridge  and Dunclose were united and called the  DunClose Branch under the care of Samuel Badham 
 The Sunday following was July the 7th which  was an important day in my history. In company of  two of the Twelve and about one hundred Saints I and  Mrs Woodruff crossed in the ferry boat from Montrose to  Commerce to attend meeting that the Twelve might deliver their  farewell address before they left for England    When we arrived at the place of meeting  Elder John E. Page was speaking. He occupied the stand  in the fore-part of the day and spoke much of the proof of  the Book of Mormon.    In the afternoon brother John Taylor spoke   I followed and afterwards Orson Hyde and Brigham Young  President Rigdon then addressed us with remarks peculiarly  adapted to the circumstances of the Twelve taking their  departure from all they held dear on earth to go to other  nations to bear the testimony of God's work and revelation of  the last days. His appeal to our affections was so powerful  touching our parting from our wives and children the  trying circumstances that surrounded our families the perils  that we might meet and the blessings we should receive &c.  Tears were brought from many an eye while he addressed us    Joseph then spoke to us a few words  and said, "Remember brethren, if you are imprisoned brother  Joseph has been imprisoned before you; if you are  placed where you can only see your brethren only through  the grates of a window while in irons because of the Gospel  of Jesus Christ, remember brother Joseph has been in like  circumstances."    After this manner were his remarks  and then the meeting closed and three were baptised.    The third day after this I spent with  Joseph and some of the Twelve in arranging a selection of  hymns for the Church and two days later I assissted John  Taylor in looking over the proof shee[t] of the first Number of   the "Times and Seasons"    We afterwards had interview with  the Presidency and also Elder Kimball. We also administered  to the sick and Joseph called upon the Twelve to visit and  lay hands upon Father Smith that he might be healed 
 On the 19th of April I rode to brother Levi Taylor's on Bloody, Ten;  and there learnt that Elder David Patten one of the first Twelve  had arrived and was at Col. Copeland's. This was to me glorious  news. I proceeded thence to John Rowley's where I had the pleasure  of an interview with Elder Smoot who had been with Elder Patten  and his wife for several days. He related the glorious news communicated  to him and gave an account of the endowments at Kirtland Ohio  relating that the Heavens were opened and angels were seen and  Jesus sitting on the right hand of the Father. I was farther told  that Elder Warren Parrish one of the first Seventy and some others  of the first Elders were expected to visit us and that there was  also a Seventcond Seventy chosen and that I was one of them. Two   days afterwards I had an interview with brother and sister Patten.    May 28th a conference was held at brother Seth Utlay's  agreeable to appointment at which Elder David Patten presided  and Warren Parrish acted as clerk. The usual business of Conferences  was taken up and on the next day Sunday we had a good time  and much of the Spirit and power of God and though we were  threatend by wicked men we were not harmed. After communing  with the Saints we closed by singing, The Spirit of God like  a fire is burning.    The last of May was thus far the most interesting &  important day of my life for on this day I was ordained one  of the Second Seventies. My ordination was requested by  the Presidency of the Church at Kirtland. There were  glorious things pronounced upon my head by the Spirit of  prophecy and revelation. It was said that my enemies would  strive to take my life but that God would deliver me out of  their hands; that the Lord would give me the desire of my  heart and that his eye had been upon me all my life long  to prepare me for this work; that I should travel to the nations  of the earth and the Islands of the sea to proclaim the word of   God.    I will here incorporate a true copy of    This certifies    That Wilford Woodruff has been ordained into the Church  of Latter-day Saints organized on the 6th of April in the year of

 As a close to the scenes of this day we received the welcome  intelligence of the escape of Parley P. Pratt and others from prison where  they had been confined seven months. O[r]son his brother assisted them  Parley afterwards published a thrilling and interesting chapter of this imprison-  ment and escape. Soon after this Parley was home and I had  the pleasure of meeting him.    A day of Gods power    Joseph Heals the Multitude  [rest of page blank] 
 our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty and has been ordained an  Elder according to the rules and regulations of said Church and is duly  authorized to preach the Gospel agreeable to the authority of that office.  From the satisfactory evidence which we have of his character and zeal  for the cause of righteousness and diligent desire to persuade men  to forsake evil and embrace truth we confidently recommend him to  all candid and upright people as a worthy member of society. We, therefore,  in the name and by the authority of this Church grant unto this our  worthy brother in the Lord this letter of commendation as a proof  of our fellowship and esteem:    Praying for his success and prosperity in our Redeemer's  cause.    Given by direction of a Conference of Elders of said Church  assembled in Kirtland Geauga County Ohio the third day of March  in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty six:    Joseph Smith Chairman  F. Williams Clerk.  Kirtland Ohio, May 2nd 1836.    This certifies    That the within -[above]- Licence was recorded on the  2nd day of May 1836 in Kirtland Ohio in the Licence Records'  Book A, Page 97;    Thomas Burdick Recording Clerk.    ^This paragraph is out of place—[Move] to 2nd September 1836^    The time had now arrived which was bringing to a close  my labors among the Southern Churches over which I had presided  with much joy and satisfaction in the Lord. On the second  of June I took the parting hands of the Saints of Eagle Creek Branch  and from this date and during several following months I was travelling  over that district which had been placed under my watchcare preaching  my farewell sermons and giving my parting testimonies to all who  came to hear concerning the glorious work of the Almighty and the  revelations of Jesus in this final dispensation    Most of the Churches in the South had been raised up during  my labors in this district of country. It was therefore with much  feeling that I parted from my beloved brethren and sisters in Christ  and I felt that sadness which the heart partakes when parting from  those to whom we have become attached and bound by strong  ties. And I had become bound to these by the strong ties 
             Elder Charles Price   have the care of the Churches at   Ledbury and         Ridgway Cross      Elder James Hill   have the care of churches at   Hope Rough and         Standly Hill       and that                 Elder John Benbow   have the care of Churches at   Froom's Hill       It was moved by the President of the meeting Willford Woodruff  and seconded by Elder Willard Richards that    Elder Thomas Kington  be the Presiding Elder of all the churches  composing The Conference  (carried unanimously)    After remarks by the President the meeting adjourned  till 2 o'clock p.m.  (During recess ten persons were baptized)    Conference Re-Assembled  at 2 o'clock p.m.    The sacrament of the Lord's supper was administered  to several hundred Saints after which twenty were confirmed  members of the Church and twenty children blessed under  the hands of Elder Richards and Woodruff    Thomas Kington was appointed by the  meeting to represent the Froom's Hill Conference at    The General Conference  at Manchester    and ordered that the clerk should present Elder Kington with  a copy of the minutes of this conference for safe keeping  and also a duplicate copy to be presented at  The General Conference.    The minutes were then read and accepted by the  Conference present. 
 Three days after this time of miraculous power  I was for the first time in my life was attacked with  the chills and fever. A number of the quorum of the   Twelve were taken ill, and the Evil One strove to bind  us down that we should not go into the vineyard    I continued still to have the fever ague  every other day. Thus ^So^ it was also that ^with^ the others of the  Twelve ^who^ like myself prepared for our departure ^when^ sick and  near^igh^ to death and leaving our families under trying  circumstances. And not only were we battling with  disease previous to our starting from our friends and  homes to sojourn in a foreign land but thus it was  and thus ^when we left^ and thus farther disease followed on  our track for several months and the Destroyer sought   to lay us low.    The time came for me to leave my  family to carry the Gospel of Jesus to the nations of Europe  in fulfilment of the command of God. Accordingly I  left my parting blessing with my wife and took my farewell  of her and other Saints on the morning of the 8th of Oct ^August^ 1839.    We left Montrose and crossed the Mis^sissippi^  for the purpose of commencing a journey of about six thousand  miles to preach the Gospel in Europe. We started without  purse or scrip^t^ and that too with the fever and ague resting  upon me every other day. I left ^started^ in company of Elder  John Taylor and we were the first of the Twelve who  left Nauvoo on this important mission. The rest expected  to follow us immediately    On the second day of our journey we passed   through Carthage and arrived at brother Perkin's where we stoped  until 12 o'clock during which I was suffering under powerful  ague and fever. We continued in the afternoon and rode in  a wagon with brother Perkins 25 miles to bro. Carlos Smith's.  It was over a rough road and I suffered much this day. The   fever was all the time heavy upon me and it seemed that  I should shake to piceces in the wagon.    We tarried in this region some days   and the Saints contribited a little means to help us on our 
 of the Gospel and united to them by that Spirit which binds the hearts  of the Saints together and seals them in the New and Everlasting Covenant  I felt towards them as a father and shepherd in the Church seperating  from his flock; and it was with a kindred spirit that the Saints and  Branches one after the other gave me their affectionate farewells and  invocations of the Lord's blessing upon me.    Elder July the 1st After preaching at a Mr David Criders myself and  Elder Smoot spent the night at the house of a Baptist Priest by name  Bradford. He was a predestinarian but what was more remarkable  he was also inclined to the faith of a Mr Hunt who claimed  to be Moses. I make record of this because others in these days  of false Christs and false prophets have put forth the extravagent  claim to be Moses the Prophet come again.    On the 14th of July wrote a letter to President O  Cowdery Kirtland, sent him nine subscribers for the Messenger  and Advocate and gave him an account of my proceedings    I rode to Col. Solomon Copeland's on the 19th where I  learnt that Elders David Patten and Warren Parrish had addressed  a letter to the Col., stating that the Sheriff and other officers of  Benton County, Ten. had issued a warrant against them  and myself. The crime alledged against us was that we had  taught that Christ would come in this generation and that we  said that some individuals would receive the Holy Ghost  in twenty-four hours. As I was absent I was not taken  but Elders Patten and Parrish were by an armed mob, in  reality, about fifty in number and bound under a bond  of two thousand dollars for their appearence in Court:  Brothers Seth Utley and Albert Petty were their bondsmen.    On the Tuesday following they appeared at Court to  plead their cause like St. Paul but were deprived of every  privilege which both the laws of God and man accord  Elder Parrish in some degree pled his own cause but no evidence  was allowed to be produced nor lawful hearing granted them  The judges decided this mock trial to suit the ungodly rabble and  condemned them without any cause or guilt being found in  them. And stranger still than this judicial farce was its  sequel. After condemning them they let them go clear though  the mob desired to beat them first but they were not  permitted this outrage.    August 2nd I took Jude the Beast that I had been riding 
 The President of the meeting followed by Elder  Willard Richards then gave instruction to Saints concerning  the order of the Church and the duties of the members and  bore their testimony to the multitude of the truth of the work  They were followed by Elder Kington after which it was  moved by Willard Richards and seconded by Willford Woodruff that  the conference assembled should be adjourned until the    21st of September next 10 o'clock a.m.  (carried unanimously)    After singing and prayer the assembly dispersed and  the Elders and officers went    Into Council    and chose Elder Willford Woodruff President and  Elder John Benbow clerk    Willard Richards opened the meeting by prayer and then  motioned that we proceed to establish and organized monthly  councils of the Priesthood of the Froom's Hill conference to  commence on Friday the 3rd of the next July at half past 7  o'clock p.m. in the several divisions of the conference respectively  assigned to the different Elders as follows:                 Dun's Close   council President Elder Thomas Clark       Standing clerk James Meeks      Wind Point   council President Elder Samuel Jones       Standing clerk William Williams      Lugwardine   council President Elder Philip Green       Standing clerk Francis Burnet      Stoke's Lane   council President Elder John Cheese       Standing clerk George Allen      Moor End Cross   council President Elder Charles Price       Standing clerk Thomas Jenkins      Standly Hill   council President Elder James Hill       Standing clerk Joseph Pullen      Froom's Hill. council President Elder John Benbow       Standing clerk John Morgan       It was farther moved by Elder Richards and seconded  by Elder Kington that a monthly General Council of the  officers of the Conference be held at Standly Hill to commence 
 journey to England. We were to go with Father Coltrin in a two horsed  wagon to Ohio. On the 14th of August brother George Miller gave  us a horse and we started on our journey travelled to the Illinois  river and crossed at Beardstown and continued four miles making  thirty-eight during the day    On the morrow we reached Springfield and  attended meeting. I addressed the Church in a few words and  Elder John Taylor followed me. We had travelled forty miles  this day and I felt very wearied.    In Springfield Elder Taylor engaged a printer  to print 15 hundred copies of a brief sketch of the persecutions  and sufferings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  by the inhabitants of Missouri.    With Father Coltrin I rode to Rochester on  the 17th and had the pleasure of greeting some of the Fox  Island friends    We continued our journey on the 21st  and on the 25^4^th we left the State of Illinois and passed into  Iowa. We crossed the Wabash and stoped at Dr Modesett a  member of our Church. I was much fatigued and had fever    Notwithstanding my fatigue and fever I  had an interview during the evening with a Mr Adams who  had been a constant companion of my brother Asahel for several  years.    Mr Adams spoke highly of my brother and  of the strictness of his principles. He said Asahel got along well in  his business until the last year of his life. He bought a large  quantity of books and they did not sell as well as he expected  and he was in consequnce not able to meet all his engagements  This was a source of much regret to him and the main  cause of his estate becoming insolvent    During the last year of his life he manifested  a greater desire than ever to improve his mind. He read  many of Tom. Paine's works and they tended more fully to  establish him in the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed through  the Prophet Joseph in the last days. Ashahel considered  Paine's writings easy to be refuted    My brother was more free in opening his 
 for the last year belonging to brother Samuel West out of her stable to ride  to Greenhill School house to attend to an appointment for preaching. I found  her very sick and we concluded that she had been poisoned. I rode her to  the meeting and preached and thence fohur miles which was the last any  person ever rode her. The next day after much suffering she died. I opened  her and became convinced that she was poisoned which indeed was also  acknowledged by one who knew the fact. Elder Smoot's horse also met  the same fate being poisoned by wicked men who very likely would not  have hesitated much in administering a similar potion to us. Thus  ended the life of poor Jude who had carried me thousands of miles and  had carried others also on the same errand—to preach the Gospel. This left  me to travel on foot.    On the eleventh I met brother and sister Patten who had been  driven from Benton County, Ten., by a lawless mob on an account of  their religion. Himself and brother Parrish had both been hunted from  place to place by the ungodly rabble until Elder Parrish had left  for Kirtland. Benton County mob had organized themselves into  an indipendent company to beat and kill the Elders of the Latter-  day Saints if they came into that county    On the 23rd at a meeting we heard that brother President [Patten]  had received a letter from Zion from President Marsh bringing the  intelligence that the Saints were about to leave Clay County and colonize  by themselves in consequence of a mob that was rising against them and  that Elder Marsh was about to visit us.    September the 2nd we held our Conference at which were  Presidents Marsh and David W. Patten Counsellor Elisha H Groves  and Elders W. Woodruff A. O. Smoot D. Cathcart and B. Boydstun  The conference took the subject into consideration and decided upon  the propriety of calling upon the Presidency of the Seventies for ministers  of the Gospel from their Quorums to fill the vacancies for preaching  in this district of country. It was voted that Presidents Marsh and  Patten write to said Presidents for six faithful laborers and it was  farther resolved that as Elder Woodruff and others were about to leave  for Kirtland the Presidency of the High Priest Quorum should be  requested to send an High Priest to watch over the Churches in the   South. It was also resolved that a petition should be sent to the Editor  and Proprietor of the Saints Messenger and Advocate requesting  him to publish in addition a monthly periodical large enough  to contain the interesting letters of the Elders abroad! The Conference  lasted several days. 
 on Friday the 17th of the next July at half past seven o'clock p.m.  with Elder Thomas Kington President and Elder John Benbow  standing clerk (carried unanimously)    The President, Willford Woodruff, then explained the nature  of the Priesthood and the duties and privileges of the officers and  gave such instruction as their situation required. He was followed  by Elder Willard Richards who touched upon many important  principles connected with the building up of the kingdom  The minutes of the council was then read and accepted and  having sung The Spirit of God like a fire is burning Willard Richards  gave the benediction and the brethren separated with feelings of  gratitude and thanksgiving that God had been with his people and  love and union prevailed in all the deliberations of that day.    President of the Day Willford Woodruff  Clerk John Benbow    Marvellous indeed had been the work of God in  the Herefordshire mission. Less than four months since  the Gospel was first preached in this region of country—  less than four months since I was moved by the Spirit to  open this mission and led as by the hand of God to Froom's  Hill to the house of brother John Benbow and now there  were raise up two organized conferences consisting of  Churches 33 Members 534  Officers 75  Viz. Elders 10 Priests 52 Teachers 13    June 22nd Willard Richards and myself spent the morning  at Elder John Benbows in arranging the minutes of the conference    Just as we were about to leave Frooms Hill on  the same day we were called upon to baptize five persons  The ordinance was administered to them by myself and  two more were baptized by Elder Clark. These we  confirmed and blessed four children and then started on 
 mind to Mr Adams than to any other man and he  was more capable of judging his views and feelings upon  spiritual subjects. He informed me that his mind was  deeply engaged with the faith of the Latter-day Saints    At first my brother said but little about the  subject but before his death he warmly contended for the principles  and defended the cause of the Latter-day Saints when it was  assailed.    Asahel was not himself during the last few  months of his life but was absent minded and overwhelmed in  deep study and would be lost in thought for hours together  He lost his former cheerfulness and during those last months  he spoke more frequently of his friends than before and  especially of myself. He was making preparations to go east  and was only hindered by his sickness and death.    Mr Adams confirmed the statement that  my brother's loss was much regreted by all of his acquaintances  and said that Asahel maintained that the cause of the Latter-  day Saints was worthy of a thorough investigation and  ought to be carefully searched into.    Sunday the 25 I visited my brother's  grave wrote two letters one to my Sister Eunice. I was  sick and had a very restless night.    On the 29th we passed through Indian-  apolis. This was a gloomy day to us both in body and  soul. The enemy made a powerful attack upon the  life of Elder John Taylor. He fainted several times and  it seemed that he would die. We were obliged to stop  and tarried for a few house ^hours^ at a house by the way side  We then took brother Taylor in the wagon and drove to  brother Eldridge's and spent the remainder of the day in  nursing Elder Taylor.    Father Coltrin exchanged horses with Elder  Eldridge and we continued on our journey 40 miles the  next day over rough road. We were terribly shaken in  our weak state.    The day following we travelled to German-  town where we were obliged to stop in consequence of brother 
 On the 6th rode Parson Baity a preacher of the Christian order. He  received us kindly and in warm friendship as disciples of Christ. Elder  Clapp and myself retired aside the abodes of men and prayed  unto the Lord to bless Parson Baity and his household and we  covenanted together not to leave his house until he became a  Latter-day Saint. We returned to his house, preached the Gospel  to him and he received it gladly. On the next day we arose  and baptised him and then went on our way rejoicing.    The 19th was a day interesting and long to be remem-  bered in consequence of the prospect of the fulfilment of the words  of the ancient Prophets who testify of the great events of the last  days especially the gathering of Israel.    The time had now arrived when some of the Saints of God  in the South began to take their families their carriages wagons  oxen horses tents arms &c and move towards Zion as the children  of Israel according to commandment.    After breakfast on the 19th of September we repared  to the bank of a stream and prayer having been offered up  to God President Marsh led a young man into the waters  of baptism and he was confirmed upon the bank    The ceremony concluded we took the parting hand  of those beloved servants of God who with sister Patten set off  towards Zion to be followed by others on the same day  with ox teams.    After spending a short time in arranging the  wagons and teams the company was prepared to move forward  It consisted of four families; including three Elders in the  camp. The families were these: Lewis Clapp and family  John Camp and family Albert Petty and family and Elder  Benjamin Clapp and family; also Elders Boydstun and  Cathcart. The company chose Elder Boydstun as their  leader in their journey Zionward.    The company consisted of males 6 females 5, children 10  and one servant making in all twenty-two. They were principally  the first fruits of my ministry.    After bidding adiu to their friends they moved  forward on their journey in good spirits and with joy I rode  with them on their first day's travel as far as the Southfork  of Mayfield w[h]ere we camped for the night.    When we had pitched our tents and taken supper 
 journey to attend the Manchester conference  I never before had left a field of labour with as much  satisfaction and I felt to render up unto God the gratitude  of my heart for giving me so many souls as seals to my  ministry and I noted in my journal of that day the remarkable  fact that I had been led by the Spirit (a little over a quarter  of a year before) through a densely populated country for  eighty miles and chose no part of it for my field of labour  until I was led by the Lord to the house of John Benbow  at Froom's Hill where I preached for the first time on the  5th of March. Now on the 22nd of June I was journing  to the Manchester conference where will be represented  this fruitful field of my labours with thirty three organized  churches numbering five hundred and forty one members  three hundred of whom received the ordinance of baptism  under my own hands    Elder Brigham Young laboured with  me in this vineyard about one month from whom I and  the Saints received much benefit for he is mighty  in council and endowed with much wisdom.  Willard Richards had laboured with me two months  and was also a great blessing to us for he had  passed through a great school of experience and learnt  much wisdom and his sound judgement was very manifest  in the councils and conferences in which we had  sat together.    We walked to Ledbury that afternoon  a distance of eight miles where we spent the night and  baptized one.    The next day Elder Willard Richards  and myself took coach to Worcester and thence to  Birmingham. This is the first time I had  visited this great manufacturing town. Birmingham  is the centre of England in its location.    Here Elder Richards and I parted  He took train for Manchester and I the coach for  West Bromich and called at sister Mary Packard  who informed me that Elder Turley was in another 
 Taylor's sickness. He suffered much and ba billious fever set in upon  him. I also felt quite ill myself. This was an afflicting day to us    The next day was the first of September and Sunday  Elder Taylor felt much better and we concluded to spend the day  in the place and preach to the people. It was a German  settlement. I delivered a discourse on the first principles  of the Gospel and other subjects. Brother Taylor followed and  spoke until he was quite exhausted not realizing his bodily  weakness. I became chilled myself and we returned to the  inn where we stoped when I was immediately taken with  the ague followed with high fever which lasted most of the  night.    The next day Elder Taylor was worse and had a  high bilious fever and could not continue his journey. It was  now evident that brother Taylor would have to be left behind  It was painful to think of parting from him and to leave  him sick nor should I have done so had I been able to  take care of him myself but this my health would not permit    Elder Taylor advised me to continue my  journey with Father Coltrin and make the best of my way  to New York and I accordingly concluded to take his  advise.    After committing my companion in the  ministry into the hands of God I parted from him in  Germantown Wayne Co. Indianna leaving him in the hands  of our Divine Master on whose work we were and in  the care of a kind and benevolent family who promised  to do everything in their power to make him comfortable  until his recovery of which I had full confidence and  faith that the friends who promised to care for him  would keep their word.    We started and rode to Richmond and  out of the State of Indianna into the State of Ohio and  passed through the town of Eaton on our way where my  wife suffered with the brain fever last winter as we  journeyed west. I noted the house in particular where  Mrs. Woodruff was healed by faith and the power of  God. We travelled this day 45 miles. 
 I assembled this small camp of Israel at Brother Petty's tent to address  them for the last time in the South. When they were gathered together I  arrose to speak to them upon the subject of their jo^u^rney. The rain was  descending in torrents so that we were soon wet through even within  a good tent. Yet my soul was full of emotion and inspired with feelings  of no ordinary character. I endeavored to lay before them the worth  and value of the cause in which they were engaged and that they were the  first in fulfilling the Prophets who spake of the South keeping not back  and that it would be recorded in the archieves of heaven to be read in  the day of eternity that they were the first fruits of the South who  spread their tents for Zion. I also gave them some practical counsel  in relation to their journey. I was followed by Elders Boydston Cathcart  and Clapp who spake in the Spirit of God with feelings of the deepest  interest. During the meeting the company covenanted to give heed  to him whom they had chosed as their leader. We closed by our  kneeling when I supplicated a throne of grace and implored the  mercy of God to rest upon the camp and that they might all  reach Zion in peace    In the morning we arose and found all well notwithstanding  the severity of the night. I breakfasted at brother Petty's tent and then   took the parting hand of these beloved Saints until I should meet  them soon in Zion. "May the God of Israel attend them for  ever" was the language of my heart at the time.    October the 24th I started with Elder Smoot and Priest  Turpin bound for Kirtland and travelled 25 miles to Paduche.  On the following day I went for the first time in my life on board  a steam boat to continue my jo^u^rney.    The interval from October 23rd to November 25th was filled  up with our jo^u^rney Zionward. During this time we held meetings  called upon the friends and relatives of brother Smoot    We reached Chardon on the 24 and providentially met Elder  Henry Sherwood on his way to Tennessee. We had a pleasent interview  with him. I wrote a letter to send to the Saints where I had been  laboring and amongst whom Elder Sherwood was going to labor in the  ministry.    On the morrow we took the hand and parted from Elder  Sherwood and then I set out in company with Elder Smooth in a  hard snow storm for Kirtland. 
 part of the town and had commenced baptizing in that place. She  accompanied me to brother John Robinson's Gritts Green near Bromwich when  I learned that Elder Turley had gone to Birmingham. I wrote to  him to return and see me    I had not been in the house but a short time  before two men came in full of wrath and brought a little blind  girl and demanded of me to heal her and work a miracle that they   might have a sign. After telling them the character of those who  sought for signs one of them brought a railing accusation against  me and rejected my testimony. Brother Turley had been preaching  at this place for three weeks and had baptized nine persons. During  the evening several came to inquire into the work and four offered  themselves for baptism. I spent the night at George Morrall's    Nest day I met Elder Turley and was happy  to see him. He read a letter to me which he had received  from his wife containing much interesting matter to me.   He informed me among other items that Elders Orson Hyde and  John E. Page were set apart at the general conference by the Prophet  Joseph on the 6th of April to go to Jereusalem and that they would  visit England on their way. The letter from Sister Turley  also stated that sister Woodruff was at the conference and was  in good health. I preached that night at the house of Bro.   Walker and four were baptized by Elder Turley.    The day following was also spent at  West Bromich and preached in the evening when another was  baptized and we ordained one priest and one teacher    So also was the 25 spent at the same  place where I again preached    On the 26weth we took the Omnibus to  Lane End at the Staffordshire Potteries via Wolverhampton and Stafford  It would be difficult to describe the scene between Birmingham  and Wolverhampton. The whole county arround was  sending up smoke and flames from its innumerable furnices  I thought I never saw anything which came so near the   description of the lake of fire and brimstone as that scene  For miles theat country is one universal mass of coal pits  iron mines and furnaces belching out fire and smoke    Ariving at Lane End we called upon 
 I will pass over the detail of my journey  until the 21st during which time I had parted from  Father Coltrin and on my way at Palmira I was near  the place where the Book of Mormon was found. The  chills and fever had also followed me also during this  part of my journey.    On the 21st of September I reached   Farmington my birthplace. I was once more at my  father's house and had the privilege of meeting my parents  and my sister. Here I tarried for a short season and  continued quite ill.    On the 26th I rode with mother and aunt  Bulah to uncle Adna Hart's whom we found sick and nigh  unto death and on the next day my grandmother Anna Thompson  died age 84 years.    On the 3rd of October I baptized my cousin  Betsey Cossett    My uncle Adna died on the next day  Thus my relatives were droping into eternity one after another.  But thank God there is a power in the plan of salvation  to redeem from the grave. I was baptized for my uncle  Adna on the 26th of August 1844.    Here I will observe a singular fact:  Mercy Thompson Samuel Thomson and my grandfather  and grandmother Lot and Anna Thompson all of one  family died at the age of 84 years.    I was called upon by my relatives to attend   the funeral of Uncle Adna which took place on the 5th  I had suffered with the chills and fever almost daily for  about 15 days and to undertake to preach a sermon in  my weak state and at the very hour my ague usually  came on required much resolution and faith. However  I promised to go and gave out the appointment. It was  a chilly day. I rode in company with my step-mother  and sister Eunice to Avon three miles from Farmington.    Arriving at the house of uncle Adna  the neighbours soon began to assemble and I had the  pleasure of meeting many friends whom I had not seen 
 I will here extract from my Journal a full description of this day  and my feelings and impressions upon visiting and ^the^ city and Temple as  written by me at that date.    The Temple of the Lord came in sight (first in importance  to our view) before we reached Kirtland. I truly rejoy^i^ced as the  House of the Lord rose in the view as we drew near this stake  of Zion. It was the first time that I had seen the Temple  built by the commandment of God in this generation    We soon entered the place and I spent one of the most  interesting and happy days of my life. The day was occuppied in  looking around Kirtland visiting the Temple and calling on the  Elders and Presidents of the Church    After a seperation of two years and a half I was much  rejoyiced to strike hands with the Prophet Joseph again and also  of many others of the beloved ones engaged in rolling on the  mighty work of God and of Israel. Among the rest I had  the privilege of again meeting with Elder Warren Parrish and  becoming acquainted with his companion and wife. This gave  me much pleasure; for there is a joy in meeting our brethren  and companions in tribulations that the world knows not of  because it flows from a celestial source.    I spent a short time in conversing with my friends  and then a more important scene opened to my view than ever  kings saw in this generation. It was that of the Temple of  Israel's God. Our visit to that holy house was to us the  crow[n]ing event of the day. I was accompanied by brothers  Smoot and Parrish. Each appartment of the Temple was  visited in turn. When we crossed the thresho[l]d of the house  and passed into the lower room great solemnity amounting almost  to a feeling of awe came over me for I felt indeed that my  my footsteps were in the Temple of the Lord of Host^s^.    Having walked into the pulpits errected for the Priesthoods  and viewed the curtains we asscended into the upper rooms. And  as we passed from view to view scenes met our eyes showing  the grandeur solemnity and order that nothing short of wisdom  from God could design    In the upper rooms we saw four Egyptian mumies  and the Book of ##Abraham|Abraham## written by his own  [rest of page blank] 
 for a long time.    After singing and prayer I arose at the same  hour that my ague came on usually and addressed the assembly  I spoke for an hour or more in preaching the funeral sermon  of uncle Adna.    I took a last look at the corps which was  very pleasent and it was conveyed to the graveyard where  my mother grandfather and many relatives were buried.    I did not go to the grave myself but after  conversing with two of my relatives upon the things of the Kingdom  I returned to Farmington very thankful that I had been  delivered from the ague this day notwithstanding that I had  been so exposed; nor did I have it any more for many  days    I left my Father's house and continued  my journey on the 7th of October and arrived at New York  on the 19th. ^9th^    Elder Parley P. Pratt arrived on the 24  with his family and several more of the Twelve were expected  to be in New York soon.    November the 1st I accompanied Elders Clark  Wright and Mullenar on board the packet ship Tarolinta  Capt. Smith bound for Liverpool    I had expected to go with these brethren  but thought it wisdom to tarry until more of the quorum of  the Twelve arrived so that we might hold a Conference  in New York before we started for England    Soon after this I saw in a dream  Mrs Woodruff in deep afliction at Montrose but I did not see  our child. This was in reality the case of my wife.    Elder Orson Pratt arrived in New York  Nov 19th ^13^ and on the 19th we held a Conference in this  city.    On the eveni ^night^ of the 28th I had another  dream of my wife. I saw her and notwithstanding that  we rejoiced much at meeting each other yet our joy was  mixed with sorrow for after conversing awhile about  her domestic affairs I asked where Sarah Emma was 
 [top of page blank]  In the upper story school room and belfry I was privileged with many  other interesting sights. Everywhere as we viewed appartment after appartment  of the house of God we saw Divine wisdom and high archetectural design  and skill revealled.    We then spent some time in visiting the Bank and Printing  Office. It appeared that wonder upon wonder was opening before  me as these scenes in Zion became revealed and laid before my eyes as  the beginning of the great work of Israel's God in the last days. I thought,  "Well has the Prophet exclaimed, "He does things we look not for". [##Isaiah 64:3##]    Two years and a half had elapsed since I left Kirtland with  my brethren in poverty to go up to visit our brethren in tribulation  in Zion. The Saints at Kirtland were then poor despised and looked  upon by the pomp of Babylon with disdain and people with eager  eyes wanted to behold them sink into forgetfulness. But what  a change has come? Now I  behold a cheerfulness beaming upon  every countenance and the scenes around indicated prosperity. The  noise of the ax^e^ and the hammer and their bank and market and  especially the House of God speak in language loud as thunder that the  Saints will have a city in spite of all the false prophets of Baal and  in spite of even earth and hell combined because God is with them  and His Temple stands in honor of his kingdom while Babylon begins  to wonder and she will soon perish."    I have given this extract from my Jo^u^rnal with  scarcely any alteration. I desire my history as it proceeds as far  as possible to represent myself at the different stages of my life and  it must be understood that this work is simply a translation of  my dirary into narative form and that more thatn three parts  thereof are the words and sentiments written (much of it) thirty years   ago.    Sunday Nov 27 Elder Smoot and myself accompanied  Elder Parrish to the House of the Lord for the purpose of worshiping  and for the first time to behold a congregation of the Saints assembled  within its walls. It was truly an interesting scene and brought  to my my mind much of the experience of my youth which  seemed a fulfilment of promises of the Lord made to me years ago  and to which I had been looking forward    After entering the house and seating myelf I cast 
 There were present of the Twelve Apostles Brigham Young Parley P  Pratt Heber C. Kimball, John Taylor Willford Woodruff George A  Smith and Willard Richards and of other officers 5 High Priests  19 Elders; 15 Priests; 11 Teachers and 3 Deacons    Shortly after 10 a.m. the meeting was called  to order by Elder William Clayton. It was moved by Elder Brigham  Young and seconded by Willford Woodruff that Elder Parley P. Pratt  be chosen President of the conference which was unanimously  carried and William Clayton was chosen clerk. The President opened  the meeting by prayer. There were then represented 41 churches in   England and Scotland. The British Mission thean stood  as follows    Churches 41. Members 2513  Elders 56; Priests 126; Teachers 61; Deacons 13.    Increase of the last Three months  of Members 842; of Elders 22; of Priests 74  of Teachers 23; of Deacons 5.    It was moved and carried that Elders Thomas Kington  Alfred Cordon and Thomas Smith be ordained High Priests and  John Albiston John Blezard, William Berry, John Sanders  John Parkinson, James Worsley and John Allen be ordained Elders  and that Joseph Slinger, George Walker, John Smith, Robert   Williams William Black, John Melling and John Swindlehurst  be ordained Priests. They were ordained under the hands of  Elders Brigham Young and Willard Richards.    Much other business was transacted this day  and the General Conference closed with the benediction from  Elder Brigham Young.    President—Parley P. Pratt  Clerk—William Clayton    Elders Young and Pratt ordained a man about the last  of June to the office of Elder who was in the British army  and who is now ordered to India with the regiment to which he belongs  There he will carry the Gospel.

Cordon  also ordained to the office of Elder William J Barret of Burslem 
 she answered weeping "She is dead." She also said that  she had not received my letters.    This dream was a token of what was  to come for my daughter died on the 17th of the next  July while I was in England.    On the 13th of December I wrote to  my wife and sent her 5 dollars. On this day I again  met in Conference at 7 o'clock at Elder Pratt's. John Taylor  had just arrived in New York    After passing through a severe fit of  sickness brother Taylor was enabled to continue his  journey. All the Twelve had a sick hard time in  getting along on their mission this season    On the 17th I attended a meeting  at the house of brother Niyzbot and we had a spiritual  time and  A Prophecy of Parley P. Pratt  Upon the English Mission    Parley prophesied that the history of this hmission  of the Twelve should be known unto all nations. This  at that time none could have seen only by the Spirit of  Prophecy.    December the 19th the packet ship  Oxford moved out into the stream with us on board  She had 64 steaerage passengers and 15 cabin passengers.  The ship was under the command of Capt John Rathbone  There was in all on board 109 souls.    The last day of the year found us  In the Middle of the Alantic    The sea was very rough and the weather cloudy  and we sailed under close reefed topsails. We were  one thousand nine hundred miles from New York    I will close this chapter with my 
 my eyes around upon the pulpits arranged in order for the High  Priests. I beheld the Patriarch Joseph Smith sen standing in  the upper pulpit and the Prophet Joseph and Elder Carter  in the second one. In the third Elders Parley Pratt, Orson   Pratt and Warren Parrish were seated. Soon Elder Carter  arose and opened the meeting and then preached and  then came a discourse from the Prophet Joseph.    In the afternoon I was called into the Stand  in company with Elder Smoot. I commenced by  prayer and then opened the Bible at random at the  ##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah##.    As there is something remarkable connected  with my turning to this chapter which seems to be  more than mere chance I will here give a page of   reminiscences of an earlier period of my life and before  I heard the Gospel. Indeed this I did on the occasion  of my first preaching in the House of the Lord on this  same afternoon of the Sa^b^bath of which I am writing  This page of reminiscences which I then related to the  congregation and which I shall here write was called  forth by the chapter in question and the scene before all  of which I looked upon as fulfilment of Divine promises  made to me by the Spirit years prior to this date.    In the earlier part of my life my mind had  been much exercised for several years concerning the  true Church and Kingdom of God for I did not beleive  that it existed in its true organization upon the earth  The growth of such ideas in my mind was doubtless  strengthened much and more or less ingendered there by the  teachings of an old Prophet by name Mason of whom  I have spoken in [blank]    At the time to which I refer I had pled much  with the Lord in secret to lead me right. In the year  1830 I tended a flower mill in New Hartford Ct. and during  this year there were great revivals in that town. The church  of Pres [blank] held protracted meetings ranging from three to  twenty daily ^days^. I attended some of them and had the privilege  of speaking my feelings to the people.

July th 7th I met with the Twelve and a number  of the Priesthood beside in council at the Millinnial Star office  wehern much important business was transacted and a field  of labour assigned to each officer until the next General  Conference.    After dinner the Twelve met by appointment  in front of the Infirmary and proceeded to a Paper storehouse  where Brigham and Parley had made a contract for paper suficient  to print five thousand copies of the Book of Mormon. After  seeing the paper weighed and prayed for (cost £107) we walked  to Brother [Miller] where I took refreshments with about 20 Elders  and had a pleasant time. The Twelve then went to the Star office  and held a council when it was voted that Parley might  go to New York and get his family and that Elder Theadore  Turley should lead a company of Saints from England to   Commerce (or Nauvoo) After some other business the meeting  adjourned to meet the next morning.    I wrote a letter to Phebe next day and  on the following one for publication in the Millinnial Star  and on the day after a number of letters to my friends and  family in America to be forwared by Brother Parley to New  York and on the next I assisted brother Brigham and several  of the sisters in doing up a package of No 3 of the Millennial  Star for Parley to take to New York    On the 12th I attended meeting at the Joiners  Hall. Brigham preached in the morning and I in the evening  and in the afternoon we commenced with the Saints    Next day I received a lengthy and a  very interesting letter from my wife Phebe from which  I made some extracts to be inserted in Millinnial Star  No. 4. My wife informed me that the Rev Mr Bogart  a Methodist Preacher who was the    The Leader of the Missouri Mob  had   Shot a Man during the Election 
 SYNOPSIS OF THE YEAR.    Travels.    I travelled in ten of the United States and crossed  one half of the Atlantic    Conferences.    I attended seven Conferences and held thirty four  meetings and was in eight councils with  the  First Presidency and Twelve.    I recorded in this year's Journal one  Discourse of the Prophet Joseph   to the Twelve.    Miscellaneous.    I ordained three Elders and one Priest attended  the baptism of a number of persons but did not baptize  more than one. I administered to sixteen sick persons and  some were healed wrote 35 letters and received six and  procured ten subscribers for the Messenger and Advocate  I also confirmed one into the Church. 
 very zealous in their religion; but as soon as I advocated the importance  of earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the Saints and for  the organization of the Church upon the ancient pattern and when I   farther contended for the gifts and graces of the Church as manifested in  the days of the Prophets and of Christ and his Apostles both priest and  people would oppose me. Therefore I could not unite with them  in Spirit nor feel at home in their meetings    It was during this state of things that I went before the  Lord one evening and prayed till past the midnight hour. I pled  with him to show me what to do and asked him in substance  the following questions:    "If the sects of the day are thy people O Lord and are  by Thee acknowledged in their worship and ordinances why am  I seperated from them in Spirit and feeling? and if they are not  Thy people why do they prosper?"    Of course in my prayers and suplications of that night  the questions which I have here tersely given was much lengthy  and varied than written above. But they contain the burden of  my petitions to the Lord at that time, to whom I talked in  the simplicity and straitforwardness of a child approaching his  father.    The Spirit answered and said unto me open the  Bible and it shall there be shown thee. This injunction I obeyed  and opened at random apparantly though I beleive it was directed  by the Spirit and read the ##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah##. There is not  a Chapter in the whole Bible which affords a more remarkable  and suitable answer to the prayers of that night. The chapter   indicated that salvation was near and the righteousness of God about to  be revealed; and [blank]    [eight lines blank]    I was satisfied with the answer to my prayer and  became convinced that the Churchs of the day were not of heavenly  origin and that they did not form the Church and Kingdom of God 
 and was    To be Hung on the Fourth of July for Murder    My wife also informed me that an Indian with  his wife and daughter had been baptized. He was the Indian Interpreter  of six tribes. Two Elders with their families had gone out on mission  to the Indians.    July the 15th I parted from Elder Brigham Young  and the Saints at Manchester and rode to Burslem where I again  met Elders George A Smith and Alfred Cordon. I brought with  me 110 Stars for brother Cordon and for brother Kington for  the Herefordshire Saints 550 numbers and about 100 Hymn Books    Next day I visited Stoke and Lane End  where the Saints manifested much joy at seeing me again. I  was presented with a small splendid china box as a present  from the Saints in Stoke upon Trent. That night I preached  at Hanly and baptized one.    On the following day July 17th I wrote two  letters to Phebe to be sent in a letter. I afterwards found that  my first born child    Sarah Emma Woodruff Died on this Day.    Next day I wrote to Elder Turley and a letter to the Saints  from Fox Islands at Montrose and then walked to Leek in  company of Elder George A Smith. This is the metropolis  of the Morelands. There is a large stone crinoss in the church yard  erected many centuries ago in hosnour of some Roman  Catholic dignitaries. In 1645 the rebels of Scotland broke   off the head and built a fire around it and the smoke   still remains.    The 19th being Sunday I preached at Leek  when Mr John Jones came to oppose us. His carriage  broke down on the road and he was thrown into the mud  He came to our meeting but the Lord shut his mouth  and he could not utter a word but left the room as soon  as I had closed. In the even George A Smith preached and  afterwards six were baptized under his hands. We also  ordained 2 and several were healed by our administration 
 CHAPTER XIV    Arrival in Liverpool. A Council at Preston  —our fields of labor. Visit to the Duke of  Sutherlands Park.    My labors in Herefordshire: marvellous  progress of the work under my charge. Numbers  baptised daily.    The first General Council of the Twelve   among the nations. Representation of the English  Mission. Ordination of a Patriarch. Starting  of the Millennial Star and Hymn Book.    On the 11th of January 1840 the city of  Liverpool appeared in sight and soon after a steam  tug came along side and towed us in. Arriving  in Liverpool we visited several of its most noted places  that day. During the evening I wrote three letters one  to P. P. Pratt one to my brother-in-law and one to my  wife.    We spent Sunday the day following our  arrival in visiting several of the churches of Liverpool.    The next morning after breakfast we went  on board the Oxford to get our trunks. The porter took  our trunks and boxes to Mr George Cannon's Norfolk  Street. He was a brother-in-law of Elder John Taylor    Our provision chest and a box containing  our bed and beding we left with him and then took  our trunks to the railway depôt and started per rail for  Preston Lancashire.    For the first mile we were under groung  in a tunnel cut out of a solid rock with buildings and  people over our heads.    We started from Liverpool about 6 o'clock  and arrived in Preston about 8 and called at the house  of brother Greenwood's.    Elder Willard Richards was sent for 
 I was moreover assured that I should live to find the true Church  and that I should be gathered with the people of God and have  a place and a name within the walls of His House.    From that time I continued in this hope and  did not join any religious body until I heard the fulness of   the Gospel and became a member of the Church of Latter-  day Saints.    I have now brought up my reminiscences to  that Sa^b^be^a^th afternoon when I was called into the Stand to  address a congregation of Saints assembled in the Temple  of the Lord. As I arose before the people to speak to them  I again opened the Bible at random as on the night of  which I have been na^r^rating. This time as before I again  opened to the ##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah## which was given to me  in answer to my prayer in 1830.    Directly all the scenes of that night were  brought fresh to my mind and I felt to rejoice before  the Lord and his Saints that I had lived to see the fulfilment  of the promise of the Spirit to me seven years before.    Having na^r^rated this incident to the  congregation I gave a sketch of my travels in the South  and was then followed by Elder Smoot. Bread and wine  were then blessed as the sacrament of the Lord's supper and  we had the privilege of communing for the first time in  the Temple with Saints gathered to this Stake of Zion from  the East and the West and the North and the South.    A number of the Saints met in the House of  the Lord December 1st to receive from under the hands  of Father Joseph Smith their Patriarchal Blessings.  I went up to the Temple to witness the scene and to  hear the promises made to those Saints by the spirit  of revelation and Prophecy. This was the first meeting  of the kind I had ever attended    Sunday the 4th President Rigdon called a vote  to discontinue the use of liquors entirely in the Church  both in sickness and health except for external washing  and in the administeration of wine in the sacrament  It was carried unanimously.    The next day in company with Elder Smoot  I commenced stud^y^ing the Lattein Gramma^r^ under the 
 On the 20th I did a bundle up with much pains  to send to my wife by Elder Turley and the nesxt day George  A. Smith and myself sent our packages to Manchester in   care of Brigham Young. Afterwards we parted from the  Saints at Burslem and took coach to Birmingham where  at night we attended the Seventeenth Anniversary of the  Birmingham Auxiliary to the Baptist Missionary society  at the Town Hall. This is one of the principal public  buildings in England and has the largest organ in   that country perhaps the largest in the world. It is 52  feet in height and contained 3000 pipes and 68 stops. The   Hall could seat 5000 and it was c[r]owded. The chair was  taken at 6 o'clock and there were gathered there that evening  the best ministerial talant in Europe.    Next day we traveled by coach to Worcester  and thence to Ledbury where Elder Smith remained  but I walked to Dymock and held a meeting that night    The following day we walked to Froom's Hill  and found the Saints strong in the faith and increasing  fast in numbers and prepraring for emigration with  the Saints to the body of the church in America. Bro  and sister Benbow were willing to make every sacrifice  for the gathering of the poor among God's people. A company  of about 50 were to start in a few days from the  Herefordshire district 40 of whom would go by the  generous help and philantrophy of Elder John Benbow    After my return to my field of labour  I continued my ministerial labours Elder George A. Smith  being with me. I was happy to learn that the work in  Herefordshire and adjoining country was rolling on rapidly  on every hand. The Elders and priests were universally  blessed in their ministry in this part of the vinyard  They were baptizing daily. Elder Richardson had baptized  about 40 since his arrival and Elder Key about 20 and   Elders Kington Browett Benbow Cheese Clark and others had  baptized many.    On the 2nd of July after my return  we baptized 40 in various parts of this vinyard and 
 immediately upon our arrival and in a few minutes I had  brother Willard by the hand.    We went into the house and after spending  most of the night in conversation we retired to rest    On the 17th a council was held at the house  of Elder Richards. Elder Joseph Fielding was called to the chair    At this Council it was arranged that Elders  John Taylor and Joseph Fielding ^should^ go to Liverpool Hyrum Clark  to Manchester and that Elders Wilford Woodruff and Theadore  Turley ^should^ go to the potteries and there enquire the mind of the Lord  upon the importance of going to Birmingham. Willard Richards  was to have the privilege of moving where the Spirit directed and  William Clayton was given the charge of ^the^ affairs of the Church in  Manchester.    It was directed also that the Elders should  communicate to the Presidents of the Church in England & After the  the arrangement of some more matters and various principles explained  by those of the Twelve the council adjourned.    During my stay in Preston we had many  calls every day to lay hands upon the sick and pray with them  and in most cases they were healed.    On the morning of the 18th we met at   the house of ^Willard^ Richards' for a season of prayer and fasting to obtain  a blessing before we seperated for our fields of labour. We had  an interesting time    We gave each other our parting blessings  an then we seperated and started for  Our Fields of Labour    Elders John Taylor and Fielding were bound for Liverpool  Willard Richards tarried for a season in Preston and Elders Clark  Turley and myself took the train for Manchester.    Here I had the privilege of taking by the hand  Elder William Clayton and many of the Saints of this place. Brother  Clayton was one of the Presidents Council and a wise and worthy  man.    The Church in Manchester at this time numbered 
 instruction of Professor Haws.    The Sunday following is worthy of note. The Lord through  his Prophets and Apostles sharply rebuked this stake of Zion for our  sins and backslidings and gave us timely warning that we might  escape the judgements of God else it should be with us as with  the camp of the Saints in their travels from Kirtland to Zion  Jackson County in 1834.    A meeting was held on the 20th at the House of the  Lord for the purpose of organizing the Third Quoerum of the  Senventies which had been chosen. I met with them but as  they were not all present the quorum was not fully organized  but twenty seven were ordained as members of the Third Quorum  among whom was Abraham O. Smoot. This fulfiled what  I pronounced upon his head by the Spirit of Prophesy on the  30th of June previous while in Tennessee.    On the last day of the year I arranged a summary  of my Journal as usual for the year which I will give as  before with my closing reflections for 1836.    Synopsis of the Year.    Travels and Meetings held:    I traveled six thousand five hundred and fifty seven  miles and held one hundred and fifty three meetings    Conferences and Debates:    I attended four Conferences among the Southern Churches  and held four debates.    Baptisms Etc.    I baptised and confirmed twenty seven souls and ordained  two Elders three Priests on^e^ Teacher and two Deacons. I   also attended to the ordinance of blessing nineteen children  and four persons were healed of disease under my hands  by the power of God. 
 since the General Conference there had been baptized 250 in this region    The churches here now numbered 800 members. I no longer continued  myself to baptize but called the local and traveling ministry under  my direction to administer the ordinance of baptism while George  A. Smith and myself devoted ourselves to preaching the gospel  holding councils comfirming members healing the sick and blessing  and building up the Saints. We were looking every day at this   date for Elder Heber C. Kimball.    As soon as brother Heber arrived it was our  purpose to take our leave of the Saints in this region and  go with him to    The city of London on a mission  to warn the inhabitants thereof and preach to them the  Gospel.    On the 5th of this month I wrote a letter to the  Millennial Star and on the next day I sealed up a package  of 42 letters and my Journal from Montrose to England to send  to my wife by Elder Turley. It contained all my correspondence  since the 8th of August 18239. Enclosed also was No 1 and 3 of  the Millennial Star.    It was one year on the 8th since I left  Montrose and parted from my family to take a mission  to England and my history will show how the Twelve started  under afflictions and pain how fever and ague followed us  on our journey and it will show how also the Providence  of God afterwards was manifest and how wonderfully we  had been blessed in the British Mission    August the 11th Elder Turley started for  Liverpool to prepare a ship for about 80 Saints to emigrate  and the fact that the man at whose ^house^ I first planted the  seeds of the work in this part of the Lord's vineyard now  gathered at his own expence 40 of this 80 bound for the gathering  place of the Saints. He gave one hundred pounds to  Elder Turley to pay the deposit money and secure the passage  of those who were to go through his benevolence. From  my soul I said "Let the blessing of Almighty God  rest upon brother John Benbow for ever" We took  the parting hand of Brother and Sister Benbow and the 
 one hundred and sixty four souls.    I had not been with Elder Clayton more  than a few minutes before I was called upon to visit three  sick persons and administer to them.    One case was very distressing. We found  the sister possessed of the Devil and a burning fever on the  brain. She was raging and trying to tare herself to pieces  although in the hands of three or four men.    We laid hands upon the woman and  commanded the devil to depart and the fever to be rebuked  in the name of Jesus Christ and it was done though  not without a great struggle. We left her sane and  mostly delivered of her pains    On the Sunday I met with the Saints   in Lo^mbard St^ Lower Mosby Street. Elder Turner^ley^ preached  in the fore part of the day. In the afternoon we broke  bread together in Sacrament and in the evening I preached to  a large congregation    Two offered themselves for baptism and  we laid hands upon twenty persons that were sick or  afflicted and they were usually healed.    At noon it was with difficulty that  we could get out of the house for the press of the Saints wishing  to shake hands with us    The Saints in England had great  confidence in God and his servants and there were so  many applying for the laying on of hands that it required  on our parts great faith and much of the Spirit to answer  to the faith in the people.    On the 21st we parted from Elder  Clayton and the Saints in Manchester and took the coach  and rode to Burslem in Staffordshire.    The Saints in this place numbered 66  including one Elder one Priest three Teachers and one Deacon.  Elder Alfred Cordon presided over this Branch of the Church.    The time passed on to the 29th when  Elder Turley started for Birmingham. In the interval  we had preached almost daily visited the Saints &c. 
 I established two preaching places procured twenty two subscribers  for the Messenger and Advocate and collected 70 dollars for its  support. I gave six dollars and collected 85 more for the  building of the House of the Lord; wrote 34 letters and  received seven and had three mobs come against me, but  was delivered from their hands:    REFLECTIONS OF THE YEAR.  (Copied from my Jornal of 1836.)    "The year 1836 has gone into eternity with its report  "of me and all mankind as the preceeding one went before  "and as the next and all future ones must do. O^h^ Time!  "How swift art thou! How great the events that are borne  "upon thy wings especially in this the Dispensation of the  "fulness of times.    "The year has gone and cannot be recalled; but  "during its reign the endowment of the Latter-day Saints has  "revealed a God in Israel and shown that though the heavens  "and earth pass away the word of the Lord spoken through his  "Prophets must all be fulfilled.    And what of the coming year? The thoughts  "of man may retrace his footsteps through 1836 just past; but  "who can tell what the end of 1837 will leave him. Will not  "its momentous developments and gigantic works be written in  "the archieves of heaven as great events? And will this generation  "at this late hour still sleep. If so; sleep on O Babylon and  "take thy rest for thy end cometh; and the day has dawned  "when Israel must be awoke from his slumber to prepare ^as a Bride^  "him self for the Brid^e^groom for it is the midnight hour  "of the world that fast approacheth.    "Then let 1837 finish its work with speed and  "God grant that it may report that Zion and her stakes  "reveals a God in her midst with power and glory    "Thus ends the year 1836" 
 Saints at Froom's Hill who were going with him to meet  them no more until we meet again in Navoo. We then  walked to Ledbury    Next day we went to Dymock and found  brother Heber at brother Kington's. He had come from  Manchester to meet Elder George A Smith and myself  for the purpose of going to the city of London    Brother Heber brought with him two  letters just received from America one of which was from  his wife to himself and the other from Father John  Smith to his son George A.    Sister Kimball informed us of the   death of the Presiding Bishop Edward Patridge who died  May the 27th 1840 and his daughter died a week before  him. Bishop Patridge was one of the wisest and  best men of the last days. He was like Nathaniel  of old in whom there was no guile. [##John 1:47##] He had passed  through much persecution with the Saints for the  word of God and the testimony of Jesus. In 1833 he  was imprisoned and tared and feathered. In 1839 he  was again imprisoned and passed through the great  persecutions of that year and he was a member and the  Bishop of the Church almost from its foundation    Elders Kimball Smith and myself  on this day walked to Turkey Hall in Glostershire where  we preached and on the next day went to Leigh and  held a meeting with the Saints. We all three spoke and  had an interesting time. After meeting I baptized 4  and assisted in the confirmation of seven.    On the evening of the next day we held  a council meeting at the house of Elder Browett. We   had a very profitable time and after meeting confirmed one  and healed several who were sick. The following day we  continued at Leigh.    Sunday the 16th we held a large camp  when Brothers Kimball and myself preached to large congregations  both in the forenoon and afternoon. We baptized [arbt] 4  and confirmed 64 and also ordained 1 Elder and 2 Priests. These 
 On the 30th I visited each appartment of the silk factory  in New Castle and saw them manufacture silks from the raw material  to the weaver's loom.    A week after I visited Copeland's pottery works and found  it a great curiosity. Brother John Rowley made me a present of a china  box in token of friendship with the following inscription upon it in  letters of gold:    Willford & Phebe Woodruff  A Present from  Stoke upon Trent, England,  1840.    He also presented me with three small bottles with the  names incribed on them of Phebe Sarah Emma & Eunice;  also three china pitchers inscribed with  Willford Woodruff, Phebe Woodruff  Sarah Emma Woodruff    On the 10th of Feb Queen Victoria of England was married  to Prince Albert. As many on this day were celebrating the marriage  of the Queen I thought it right to honor the king of heaven by advocating  his cause and preaching the Gospel of his son Jesus Christ.    I walked into the market place accompanied  by Elder Alfred Cordon and two other brethren and we began to sing  and pray unto God and call upon his name.    A congregation flocked around us and we  preached unto them and I bore testimony of the great work which God  had set his hand to accomplish and of the Second Coming of Christ  and warned the people to repent and be baptized for the remission  of sins.    When we had finished our testimony we  dismissed the people though many of them followed us. We also  preached in the evening at a brother's house and baptized one.    I received a letter from Elder John Taylor in  which I was informed that they had baptized ten in the town  of Liverpool.    The next night I preached at Burslem and after  the meeting a female came to be baptized. We called upon her  sister as we passed along and she said she would obey the 
 1837    CHAPTER IX.    CONTENTS    The Endowments in Kirtland Temple. My Marriage with Phebe W Carter    My Patriarchal Blessing and that of my wife Phebe    INVOCATION FOR THE YEAR.    In opening this chapter I will extract from my Journal the  following invocation for the year 1837.    "O Lord I ask thee in the name of Jesus Christ Thy Son to  look upon Thy servant Wilford who now occupies a place in Kirtland  this first stake of Zion which Thou hast appointed in this last  dispensation and fulness of times for the gathering of Thy Saints  O God of Israel inspire the heart and pen of thy servant at this time  and hear and answer the prayer which he will put up unto Thee  and remember the covenant which Thy servant will make with  Thee O mighty God of Jacob.    "O Lord Thou has spared my life to behold the commencement  of 1837. May my life health and strength be precious in Thy sight  throughout the year just begun. Wilt Thou save me by Thy  grace from all sin and the powers of temptation which try the  souls of men? Wilt thou give me favor during the year with  God and his Saints? Wilt Thou bless me while in school and  in meeting with the quorums of Seventies and while attending all  other meetings for Divine worship?    "O Lord if it by thy will give me the privilege of recording  in this year's Journal Great blessings pronounced upon my head  from mine an^n^ointing and under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph   and also an account of visions and revelations of Jesus Christ that I  might be a special witness of Thee O Lord. If I am called to preach  the Gospel this year may I be blessed with souls for my hire. If I  visit my kinsmen wilt thou make me an instrument of bringing  them into thy celestial Kingdom. And I covenant with Thee  O Lord to go and come at Thy bidding. I ask these blessings  through the Priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen."    At early candle light on the evening of January the 3rd  in company of ^with^ Elder Milton Holmes I repared to the House of the Lord  for the purpose of meeting with the Seventies. About twenty were  ordained as members of the Third quorum under the hands of Presidents 
 two latter brethren had this day come 12 miles to receive the work and  were baptized confirmed and ordained Priests on the same day.    On the 17th we took the parting hand of the  Saints at Leigh and started on our mission to London    In company of Elder Browett Elders Kimball Smith  and myself rode from Leigh to Cheltenham where we tarried  for the night and on the morrow August the 18th we continued  to journey to the metropolis of England    We took coach at Cheltenham and rode  40 miles through a level country having quite the appearance  of the Illinois and Missouri prairies occupied altogether for  farming. We passed by three villages and thousands of  acres of wheat and barley fields in the season of harvest.  Part of the crops were cut and part standing and the  country arround everywhere wore the golden hue of  plentiful harvest.    We passed through Oxfordshire and  within about eight miles of the Oxford University. This  is the largest and most famed University in the world    Journing through Oxfordshire we saw vast  herds of cattle sheep and deer. We passed insight of  Stow the family residence of the Duke of Buckingham  and the Wychwood Forest containing seven thousand  five hundred acres of timber in which thousands of 
 Gospel also. We then called upon another woman who was  believing but she made objections to being baptized then because  she had a dead child in the house. I told her to let  the dead burry the dead and to arise and follow us    The woman followed and we walked  two miles and I baptized the three females. Their husbands  were in the Church and were present at the baptism of  their wives.    We visited Stok^n^e on the 17th for the  purpose of getting a door open for the preaching of the Gospel  An house was obtained and I preached to a small congregation  in the evening    The next day we left Stone and walked  to Stoke. On our way we paid  A Visit  to  The Duke of Sutherland's Park.    It is about five miles in length and five  in bredth. The first thing of note that struck our attention  as we came on the road from Stone to Stoke was the estate  of several hundred acres of ground planted over with young  ^timber^ sprouts. This land was hilly.    Next came spring vale. The lower fountain  is a forced vein throwing a stream of water twelve feet high  There is a fish pond above the first fountain but rather  small. On the hill above is a spendid stone house for  the purpose of keeping persons who might be insane. Around  this vale are a number of small monuments.    Then came into our view the Manor House  built of stone. This was mostly in ruins and was more than  five hundred years old. One family had lived in it for more  than three hundred years descending from father to son.    We next visited the spendid monument  errected in memory of George Granville the late Duke and   father of the present Duke of Sutherland.    This monument is built of hewn stone 
 Coltrin and Aldrich. After these were ordained Elder M. Holms  and myself were called upon by the Presidents to come forward and  be ordained as members of the first Seventy Elders of Israel to  bear the name of Jesus to the nations of the earth. The first  Seventy was chosen out of the camp that went up to Zion in  1834 for the redemption of Zion; but as we were not present  at the time we were afterward ordained into the Second Quorum  There being however two vacancies in the first now we were  chosen to fill those vacancies. President Aldrich ordained  Elder Holmes and President Z. Coltrin ordained me. Great  blessings were pronounced upon our heads by the spirit of revelation    On the 6th I visited the office of the Kirtland  Safety Society and saw the first money issued by the society's  Treasurer. It was given to brother Bump (in exchange  for other notes) who was the first to circulate it. I also  heard President Joseph Smith declare in the presence of  F Williams D. Whitmer S. Smith and others that he had  received that morning the word of the Lord upon the subject  of the Kirtland Safety Society. He was alone in a room  by himself and he not only heard the voice of the Spirit  but it was also an audible voice    Meetings spiritual seasons and daily duties filled up  to Jan 23 when it was found necessary for Elder Smoot to return  to his home in the South on account of ill health. On this  day he received his Patriarchal blessing before leaving on the  25th for his home. I officiated as scribe in writing his  blessing from the mouth of the Patriarch Joseph. I gave  brother Smoot a copy of it in print.    We were threatened with a mob to visit us on  the 24th from Panesville to demolish our Bank and take our  property but they did not come as threatened. The wrath of  our enemies however was kindling against us in this part and  seemed to the watchful the scourge awaiting the people of Zion    Feb 19th I went up to the House of the Lord and  heard the Prophet Joseph address the people for several hours  He had been absent from Kirtland on business for the Church  though not half as long as Moses was in the Mount [##Exodus 24:18##] yet many  were stirred up in their hearts and some were against him  as the Israelites were against Moses; but when he arose  in the power of God in the midst of them they were put 
 cattle fed. It is also a noted resort for the Sportsmen and the hunt    At Farington Station we took the train for  London at 1 o'clock p.m. We passed through Relicks and had a   good view of the old ruins and as we dashed along in the  cars we had also a fine view of the splendid W  castle. After travelling on the rail 70 miles we reached  the great metropolis of England.    The City of London  at 4 o'clock p.m.    We took conveyance to the centre of the city  by omnibus, and then walked across London Bridge into  the Borough, and called upon Mrs Allgood, 19 King Street,  in the City. She is the sister of Elder Theadore Turley's  wife. She treated us with kindness, and gave us  refreshments and then directed us to a public house,   the King's Arms, King Street, Borough. Here we tarried  for the night. and I wrote a letter to my wife.    We were now in England's great metropolis  to sound to it the first proclamation of the Latter-Day  Work; for    Heber C. Kimball, George A Smith,   and Myself  were the Theree First Elders in London  to preach the Gospel and establish the Church of   Latter-Day Saints.    I wrote another letter to my wife next  day to be forwarded by Elder Turley. We then took a walk  a mile or two into the city, passed London Bridge twice  and returned and spent the night at the King's Arms.  There was so much passing in the street of drays and cabs  and singing and hallowing at all hours of the night that  it was with difficulty I could sleep at all    I wrote a letter to Elders Young and  Richards next day and also another to Bro F Pullin and  then we took a walk through the city. We called  upon the Rev. J. E. Smith Lincoln's Inn Fields, and  also visited John Pye 16 Curiosity Street Chancery Lane. 
 and stands upon a hill. The monument was about eighty feet high    The Duke was of course a member of the British  Parliament and as an emblem of his legislative character he held in  his ^left^ hand a roll of paper. He stands facing his splendid mansion which  is an expensive and majestic building in the vale north of the monument  at which a person has a fine view of it.    The house covers 4 acres and is built of hewn  stone having much carved work of lions and other images. There were  365 windows in it before the repairs and additions which the present  Duke was making which it was supposed would take seven years  to accomplish.    There were some hundreds of acres of woodland  on the estate and farm patches all of which were enclosed with  a fence of 4 or 5 feet high. The whole of the fence was composed  of solid iron railing miles in length.    In this park the Duke had vast quanties  of game fish and fowl. The deer was as tame as sheep. We  saw about 300 of them in one drove.    The river Trent runs through the Park  and the Duke has converted the whole of it for some distance  into a fish pond.    I visit the burrying ground which was  covered with many kinds of evergreen.    The public road running through the Park  is between two stone walls about 10 feet thick and from four  to six feet high covered with turf and green grass.    The Duke of Sutherland has two other  Parks as valuable as the one we visited and his wealth was  comparatively inexhaustible and beyond his own knowledge.    My Birthday, March 1st.    On this day I was thirty three years of age  On this birthday I preached in ^Hanly^ and broke bread and  in the evening I preached again to a large congregation when  the Spirit and power of God rested upon me. Four offered  themselves for baptism and others received my testimony  whom I expected would be baptized. 
 to silence for the murmerers saw that he stood in the power of a  Prophet of the Lord God.    The next month was principally spent in my attending school  and some interesting meetings and preparing myself for my endowments  which I was soon to have the privilege of receiving in the Temple of the  Lord with many others.    On March 23rd I went up to the House of the Lord at an  early hour in the morning to spend the day in prayer and fasting  with the Saints in Kirtland as this was a day set apart for that  purpose. Immediately after en^t^ering the House in company  ^with^ of several other Elders I went within the veil and we bowed  before the Lord in the Aronic Stand and offerred up our morning   sacrifice. The Spirit rested upon us with joy to our souls.    I was then called upon by Father Joseph to read  a chapter in the Book of Mormon and I read a chapter from the  Book of ##Jacob 5|Jacob## which contains the parable of the tame olive tree  likened unto the house of Israel as was spoken by the Prophet  Zenos. The same God that touched Isaiah's lips with hallowed  ^fire^ gave Zenos great wisdom in setting forth this parable.    When I had made some brief remarks upon the  subject the congregation took their seats for the service of the  day in the following order:    The house being divided into four parts by veils the  females occupied two parts and the males the others. Some of the  Presidency presided in each appartment    The time was taken up during the day in singing  exhortation and prayer. Some had a tongue others an interpretation   and all was done in order. The power of God rested upon the  congregation. Upon some the gifts were poured out while others  had the administration of angles and the image of God sat upon  the countenances of the Saints.    At four o'clock in the afternoon the veils were all rolled  up together which brought the whole congregation in full view of  each other and while the presence of the Lord filled the house the  congregation of Saints fell upon their knees and all as with one accord  vocally poured forth rejoicing supplication and prayer before the God of  Israel. This closed the service of the day after contributing for  the support of the poor.    Sunday March 26 in the latter part of the day Elder  Warren Parrish preached the funeral sermon of sister Pratt the 
 He was a strong beleiver in the prophecies of Joanna Southcott and  was one of the society. We then returned and had a view  of St. Pauls cathedral, the largest in the world except  St Peter's at Rome. We crossed London Bridge took  tea at 19 King Street, and then went to Union chapel,  Waterloo Road, and heard a comical sermon delivered  by an Atkinite preacher. I spent the night at 58 King  Street at Mrs Loftus.    The next day August the 21st was the  most interesting sight seeing day in my life, as far as the  viewing the splendid works of man    I started in company of Elders Heber  C Kimball and George A Smith for a walk over the  city of London. We crossed London Bridge, and passed  through King William Street, and several other streets, and visited   Covent Garden, then through St Martin Street and Court, Leicester  Square, Sidney Alley, Coventry Street, Picadillie, Glass Hous st  and through most of Regent Street, The latter is one of the  most splendid streets in the world. We passed through  Langham Place, and All Souls Church, which has a spire naked  from its base to the top, then through Oxford Street, and  returned by way of St Paul's, and ended our sight seing of  the day by visiting the noted monument erected in comme  moration of the great fire in London, in 1666, and built under  the direction of that famous Architect, Sir Cristopher Wren.  We entered a door at its base (paid 6 pence on entering) and  ascended 345 black marble steps which brought us up 200  feet into the air and about 100 feet higher than the highest  houses. We steped on the outside of the pillar, which is  surrounded by an iron railing; and here we had presented  to our view an indescribable scenery on every hand  of one of fthe greatest capital cities of the world, & which can boast  of a history of nearly two thousand years. At our feet,   as it were laid a historical panorama stretching out to our  view arround. Never before had I beheld such a splendid  sight never before such a grouping of the monuments of  ancient times never before beheld such a grand historical  illustration of London as it was through the long succession of 
 About this time commenced    A Great Work in the Potteries & ^County of^ Herfordshire.  ^through my labours^  which resulted in the baptism of hundreds and the work  flourished and grew and the fame thereof went abroad  throughout that region of country    On the 4th we took coach to Worchester and  there walked to Mr John Benbow's Hill Farm Castle Froome  Ledbury Herefordshire.    Mr Benbow was a large farmer and  cultivated about 300 acres of land. I spoke the word of  God to him and his house and he received my testimony  and we had a good time. I spent the night at his  house, and also the next day and preached there and  had the testimony that there was^ere^ many present that would  become Saints.    On the next day I preached again at  his house in the evening when a number received the  word and I baptized six. Mr John Benbow and  his wife were among the numbers. The other four were  preachers of the United Brethren of the Methodist Order.    I spent the next day in preparing a pond  to baptize in.    The next day was Sunday when I   preached in the morning at Frooms Hill in the afternoon  at Standly Hill and in the evening at the Hill Farm.  The Lord was with me and I baptized 7 persons 4  of whom were preachers of the United Brethren. I also  confirmed 13 and broke bread with the Saints.    Next day I preached again at Standly  Hill and baptised 7 persons more 2 of whom were preachers,  and one ^on^ the one following ^day^ I baptized 12 persons more, 3 of  whom were preachers.    I preached on the next three days  and the power of God was with me. On the third  day after preaching at Stokes Lane I baptized three others  into the Church. 
 wife of Elder P. P. Pratt one of the Twelve Apostles. Sister Pratt died  March 25 1837.    On Monday, the following day I signed fifty dollars for  the building of the House of the Lord in Zion. The subscription list  was in the hands of Elder Elisha H. Groves    of Several subsequent days I spent in perusing the outlines  of ancient and modern history by the Rev. Royal Robbins. The  reflective mind is struck with deep sensibility in viewing the  rise & progress, and decline and fall of the nations and Kingdoms  of the earth since the days of Adam. And it is equally important  and interesting to contemplate the day that has already begun  in fulfilment of ancient prophecy when Israel shall be restored  the Kingdom of God established upon the earth and the  covenants made by the Lord unto Abraham Isaac and Jacob  realized by their seed. As I read this book and reflected upon  those things I sensibily felt my calling from the Lord as  his servant to act my part in the fulfilment of his work  and now as one of the first Seventies of Israel to become a  special witness of Jesus Christ to the nations    April the 13rd brought the day for the preparations  to be made for the solemn assembly and the anointing and  endowment of the Elders of Israel. Those were now to receive  their endowments who had not received them in the Spring of  1836 and as I was absent at that time it fell to my lot to  receive this blessing with those who were to pass through the  Temple for endowment at this time.    I shall record the events of each day of the endowment  for the benefit of the generations to come.    On this 3rd day of April I met in the house of the  Lord with a number of the Seventies to received counselcil respecting  our washings and anointings. I was appointed with Elder  G. Meeks to visit President F. G. Williams and have the perfumes  and oil prepared for the day following that we the Elders of Israel  might become the anointed ones of the Lord according to the  revelations of Jesus Christ and as sung by the poet:    "We'll wash and be washed and with oil be anointed  "Withal not omitting the washing of feet  "For he that receiveth his penny appointed  "Must surely be clean at the harvest of wheat." 
 England's greatness by this magnificient view of London as  it is in the present day    We were situated so as to overlook nearly every  part of the city. East of us lay the ancient Tower of London; the  place of so many great historical episodes of English history, the  scene of many of the capital tragedies of England and the terrible  Bastile of England the frowning political sepulcure of the  nation where the absolute monarchs and great ruling chiefs  of the land have buried their victims their secrets and their  crimes.    East of us also lay the Mint; North the Mansion  House of the Lord Mayor of London; North West St Paul's church  West- Westminster Abbey and the House of Parliament; South  lies the River Thames with five of the large bridges across  in full view and one not seen from the mMonument making  six: One of the collossal arched Bridges of the Thames is  of solid cast iron called Southwark Bridge. This also is the  celebrated "Suspension Bridge" which at this time was one  of the great wonders of the age. The other collossal and  magnificent bridges of the royal Thames (England's chief river)  are London Bridge Blackfriars Waterloo Westminster and  Vauschall all of which are built of massive stone. These  six bridges are fine sights in themselves. They are the  architectural monuments of the Thames; and our view of them  from our high pinnacle with their crowds of moving and  everchanging human masses, and to so describe it mobs of  cabs, omnibuses, carriages, drays, &c., which dash along and seen  as though they were going to lock together and dash each  other to pieces presented to us a picturesque sight. worthy  of note.    In addition to all this within our view  was London Borough, on the South of the River, and all  around us hundreds of churches, chaples and spires,   standing in the midst of one universal mass of buildings,   covering about six square miles of ground    While viewing this prospect on a clear  day, we conversed with a Prussian Traveller, a citizen of Berlin,  who had travelled much over Europe and Asia and other parts 
 Sunday the 15th of March I preached at Froom's  Hill and met with the Saints in the afternoon and confirmed  twenty two persons and ordained John Cheese to the office of Priest.    In the evening I preached to a congregation of  about eight hundred but some of the baser sort made much  disturbance. There was a number of persons that wished to  be pbaptized but they had to return home without it in  consequence of the people.    On the next day I walked to Mainston  and obtained a license for preaching in any place under the  English Government.    On my return I visited a number of persons  and found them beleiving. I preached at Froom's Hill and  baptized three persons    The day following I had an agreeable  interview with Mr Thomas Kington the Superintendent of  the United Brethren. I laid the fulness of the Gospel before  him and he received the testimony.    On the 20th I baptized three persons one  of whom was a preacher. While preaching on this day some of  the lower sort armed themselves with rotten eggs and threw  them at me. One hit me in the head but did not break  until it struck the ground    The next day I walked to Ledbury and  found a letter from Brother Richards. Afterwards returning  to brother Benbow's I baptized four persons 2 of whom were  preachers: one was Thomas Kingston the Superintendant of  the preachers of the United Brethren. I felt to exclaim  Glory to God, this work rolls on!    Sunday I preached at Hill Farm and  in the evening confirmed 6 persons and ordained Thomas Kington  to the office of an Elder and William Jinkins to the office of  Priest.    The next day I received letters from  John Taylor Willard Richards and Alfred Cordon. Elder Taylor  informed me that he had baptized seventeen persons in  Liverpool and Elder Richards' wished me to enquire of  the Lord his will concerning ^brother^ and sister Richards for 
 After fulfiling the above appointment Elder Meeks Priest Turpin and  myself repared to a room to attend to our first washing. After clensing  our bodies from head to foot with soap and water we then washed ourselves  in clean water and afterwards with perfumed spirits. The evening was  spent with several Elders in prayer before God and his power rested  copiously upon us.    The next day I met at the house of Elder Hales at one o'clock  in the afternoon in company of twenty-three Elders for the purpose of  attending to the ordinance of washing. President Joseph Young who was of  the number opened the meeting by prayer and we then proceeded with  the ordinance. Myself and Elder G. W. Meeks were the first washed  under the hands of President Joseph Young and we then assisted him  in washing our brethren the Elders. Much of the Holy Spirit rested  upon us.    At early candle light we again met together in the  quorum of Seventies at the upper part of the Lord's house to receive  our anointing. The quorums of the Priests Teachers and Deacons  occupied one appartment the Elders another and the Seventies a third  Each quorum met for their anointing    Three of the Presidents met with the Seventies—namely   Joseph Young H. Aldrich and Z. Colultrin. After the meeting  was opened by prayer those who were to be anointed were suitably  addressed and then the Presidency proceeded to the ordinance by  first consecrating the oil. The person then presented for the  anointing took a seat and the Presidency laid their hands upon  his head and pronounced such blessings upon him as the testimony   of Jesus directed. We had truly a glorious season in this solemn  ordinance of the house of God. There were fifteen anointed in  our quorum. President Coultrin anointed me and pronounced  upon my head great blessings which were sealed upon my head in  the name of Jesus Christ by a loud Amen from all present    The meeting closed about 10 o'clock p.m. when I went  into the lower court of the House of the Lord with Elders Joseph B.  Nobles and G. W. Meeks to spend the night in prayer and fasting  before God. Part of the night we had a severe trial of our faith  by temptation from Satan but before day we obtained a good degree  of victory over him and the Lord poured out his spirit upon us  and we felt it good to be in the House of our God when nature  was hushed in silence and the shades of night covered the earth  In the morning we returned to our homes intending to spend the 
 of the world, and he declaired that we could not find another spot  on the face of the earth that would present to our view so grand  a scenery as the one before us    This mMonument on which we stood is 24  feet higher than Trajans Pillar at Rome and on it is the following   inscription in Latin:    In the year 1666 the second day of September  from hence at the distance of 202 feet, the hight up this column  about midnight a most terrible fire broke out which driven  on by a high wind not only wasted the adjacent parts but  also places very remote with incredible noise and fury.  It consumed 89 churches the gates of the city, Guild Hall  many public structures hospitals schools libraries and a vast  number of stately edifices 13,200 dwelling houses 400 streets  of 26 Wards it utterly destroyed 15 and left 8 others shattered  and half burnt. The ruins of the city were 436 acres:  from the Tower by the Thames side to the Temple church  and from the North East Gate along the city wall to Holborn  Bridge. To the estates and fortunes of the citizens it   was merciless but to their lives very favourable (only eight  being lost) That it might in all things resemble the  last conflagration of the world the destruction was sudden  for in a small space of time the same city was set [a]  most flourishing and reduced to nothing. The days after,   When the fatal fire had baffled all human councils and  endeavours, the opinion of all, as it were by the will of  heaven it stoped and on every side was extinguished.    August 22nd I received a letter from  Mrs Woodruff which gave me much joy and I wrote her  in return. We also received one from Brigham Young  and a copy of the 4th No of the Millennial Star. I walked  out in the evening near the house of Parliament and bought  a good pocket watch and paid £2.90    Next day we went to Zion's chapel and  heard the celebrated Rev Robert Aitken preach two sermons  He delivered an interesting warning to the Gentiles, and presented  some of the most sublime truths I ever heard from a sectarian  priest; but he was building without the foundation. 
 they were in deep affliction.    On this day I preached at Standly Hill and  baptized twelve persons.    A preacher called upon me On the one  following a preacher called upon me and after conversing with  him awhile he requested me to baptize him.    I changed my clothing and as I got  ready to go to the water three other preachers rode up in  a carriage to see me.    The fame had gone out into all the   country around of the rapid work that God was doing amongst  the people. They had not heard me nor any Latter-day Saint  preach but had come more than 20 miles to see me.    They came down out of the gig and walked  to where I was. Notwithstanding they were ministers I stood up  and boldy testified of the work of God in these last days.    The power of the Spirit rested upon me and they bowed  down and prayed and gave glory unto God.    We arose from our knees and the carriage  stood still and we all went down into the water that same  hour and I baptized them and afterwards laid my hands  upon them that they might receive the Holy Ghost and they  then went on their way rejoicing    Afterwards I went to ^Moorends Cross^ where  I preached and baptized five persons making nine during the  day. I also wrote a letter and confirmed eight person.    The next day I travelled and preached  as usual and at night I had a remarkable dream by which I felt  certain that there would be a great gathering of fish in the Gospel  and that I should baptize many and some noted persons. I was  also persuaded that more of our brethren was on their way from  America.    On the day following I baptized two more  one of whom was a preacher. I then walked to Shuknell Hill a  noted and sightly place. The plains looked beautiful and the  valleys around the place ^town^ made the scenery picteresque in  appearence. Notwithstanding that this was but a country  place I counted twenty one churches from the top of the hill 
 day in fasting and prayer. Part of the day was occupied in attending  the high council; the remainder until 5 oclock in writing prayer and fasting  At 5 o'clock I met in the House of the Lord with the Seventies for  a solemn assembly anointing &c. Three out of the seven Presidents  were present and they anointed twelve. The Spirit of the Lord  rested upon us and we were satisified and returned home.    April the 6th was the great day of the Solemn Assembly  As upon this day the Church was organized in 1830 the six of April  has become a day specially set apart and as this an[niversary]  of the organization of the Church was like the Pentecost at  Jerusalem [##Acts 2##] I shall somewhat fully record the proceedings of this time    At 8 o'clock a.m. I went up to the House of the  Lord and spent an hour in the lower part. The Presidents  of the Church then called the quorums of the Seventies in the  upper part of the house as there was some business to be attended  to before they could proceed with the order of the day    In the first place six of the Presidents of the  Seventies were taken from that position and transferred  to the quorum of the travelling High Priests and six other  Presidents were chosen in their stead. I shall not give the  particulars of this change: suffice it to say that all of the  counsellors first chosen excepting Joseph Young were High Priests  before the organization of the Seventies and they had the right  to officiate in the lower offices of the Church    The six new Presidents chosen out of the Seventies to  take the places of those who were to be transferred were [blank]    After this matter was arranged there was a glorious  ordinance performed upon the heads of those of the Elders who  had been anointed. While all the anointed present standing  lifted their hands towards heaven the First Presidency of  the Church confirmed and sealed upon our heads all the blessings  of our ordination anointing and Patriarchal with a seal in the  presence of God and the Lamb and his holy angels. This seal was  confirmed with a shout from all the anointed with uplifted hands of    Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna to God and the Lamb!  Amen, Amen, and Amen!    This was repeated three times and if ever a shout entered  the portals of heaven this did and was echoed by the 
 On the 24th we removed our lodgings to Mr Robert  Merryfields, No 15 Glousester Row, Grange Road, wehere we obtained  room for all three of us.    We visited St. Paul's Cathedral and went all  through the lower court. Excepting St Peter's at Rome this is the  largest and most famed in the world.    St Paul's is 500 feet long 20085 feet wide  from North to South 404 high from East to West and  it contains 74 monuments of fine marble erected over the  toombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals and Earls and men  of other titles who have distinguished themselves in the military  service of Great Britian and otherwise. Lord Nelson's   Monument is the largest and most noted of the whole of  the men thus honoured. Their bodies are placed in the   vaults and their monuments erected on the flour above    This cathedral has three lofty spires and the  whole building is magnificient.    St. Paul's church was first built by St Augustine  in the year 610 and was destroyed by fire in 961 and  rebuilt the following year. It was not until the reign of  Athelstan that London became the Metropolis of England  and it was to this King that St Paul's was mostly indebted  for its permanent establishment and pre-eminance. In 1086  it was again destroyed by fire which also laid the greater part  of the Metropolis in ruins. Maurice Bishop of London who  had been chaplain and Chancellor to William the Conqurer conceived  the vast design of erecting the magnificient structure which  immediately preceeded the present cathedral. In 1099 it was  sufficiently built to admit of public worship but was again partly  burned in 1132 and again in 1135-6 and sustained considerable  injury. The central tower was completed in 1221 and additions  was made to the building from time to time. The lofty spire  of the cathedral was fired by lightning in 1444 and not repaired  till 1462 and in 1561 it again caught on fire and the roof  also destroyed. Queen Elizabeth commenced to repair it and  Charles the First completed it at the cost of 104330=4=8; but  under the rule of the Parliament and Cromwell the cathedral  suffered befyond any former example. Its revenues were 
 I preached in the evening to a large congregation  and although it was the first time that they had heard the fulness of  the Gospel yet if there had been water convenient there would have  been twenty baptized but as it was a great distance to the water most  of them concluded to wait until another time.  Some however would  not take no for an answer and they followed me until 2 o'clock  in the morning in search for water    We finally found a stream and baptized five  persons in a place where we had to let them down eight feet by a  bank before we reached the water. Three of these were preachers and  one an old woman who had followed us the whole of the time leaning  upon her staves.    During the day ^and night^ I had baptized seven persons  and on the next day I baptized two more one of whom was a Primitive  ^Methodist Preacher^    The day following was one of much labour. It  was Sunday the 29th. I preached at Frooms Hill at half past ten  o'clock at the Hill Farm at half past 2 and baptized thirteen into  the Church. In the evening I met with the Saints and confirmed  thirty-five and broke bread with about eighty of the members of  the Church    I felt how much strength and wisdom I needed  for I was informed this day that some of the ministers of the Church  of England were holding councisels to petition Parliament to stop my  preaching and cause our religion to cease out of the land.    The last ^30^ of March was the following day  when I baptized and confirmed into the Church nine more souls  I walked to Ledbury and had not been in town an hour before  many flocked around to see me and gave me the hand of fellowship    The Baptist minister opened his chapel for me  to preach in and he went into the pulpit with me and opened the  meeting by reading the 35 ch. of Isaiah and prayed mightily for me    I then arose and preached (it was said) to the  largest congregation that ever met in the chapel. The minister was  beleiving a^nd^ bid me God speed. After meeting many offered themselves  for baptism    On the morrow I baptized 13 more four of  whom were preachers and afterwards I held a meeting in another  place at the house of brother Kington. 
 angels on high and brought down the power which rested mightily upon us    After being in the upper room about two hours we again joined  the congregation of the Saints in the lower lcourt and the house came to order  for the business of the day. The veils were closed and each appartment commenced  the service of the endowment.    The washing of the feet of the anointed was the first business  that was attended to in which the Twelve assisted the Presidency.  Heber C. Kimble attended to the washing of my feet and prophesied upon  my head pronouncing me clean from the blood of this generation like  as it was with the disciples when Jesus washed their feet.    When the ordinance of the washing of feet was ended the  veils were roled which brought the congregation into one assembly but  the stands of the Priesthood was still covered with veils and the Presidency  was in the lower stand.    The Prophet Joseph then arose and addressed the  congregation for the space of three hours, clothed with the power spirit  and image of God. He presented many things of vast importance  to the Elders of Israel. O that the record could be written as with  an iron pen of the Eight principles and virtue that came forth  out of the mouth and heart of the Prophet Joseph whose miss[ion]soul  like Enoch's seems wide as eternity. That day showed strikingly  that he is in very deed and a Prophet of God raised up for the  deliverence of Israel    He desired us to give heed to his words and  teachings and be wise that Zion and her stakes might be  redeemed. He also presented us in some degree with the plot  of the city of Kirtland which is the strong hold of the daughter of  Zion. The plan which he presented was given to him by  vision and the future will prove that the visions of Joseph concerning  Jackson County all the various Stakes of Zion and of the redemption  of Israel will be fulfilled in the time appointed of the Lord.    Presidents Hyrum Smith Oliver Cowdery and Sidney   Rigdon followed with suitable addresses to the congregation.    The Twelve were then called upon to break bread  for the multitude as Jesus did in the days of this Apostles when the  multitude followed him. [##Matthew 14:19-20##] This was done and the congregation was  satisfied and we were made glad while feasting with Patriarchs Prophets  Apostles Evangelists Pastors and Teachers. [##Ephesians 4:11##]    The feast ended thanks were returned to God with up-  lifted hands to heaven. And this being at about the setting of the 
 confiscated and seized by Parliament and the body of the building  converted into stables and barracks. In the reign of Charles the Second  it was again repared but was not finished when it became a prey  to the great fire of London in 1666. The new cathedral—the St  Paul's of to day was built by Sir Christopher Wren. The first  stone was laid on the 21st of June 1675 and the cap stone laid  by the son of the Architect in 1710 and it was finished and  issued by George the First in 1750 ^1715^. Its cost was over one million  and half sterling English money or nearly six million dollars  Its length from East to West is 500 ^ft^ and the breadth of the  body of the church 285 ft. and to the top of the cross over the dome  its height is 404 ft: and it covers over two acres of ground.    I again visited this cathedral on the 7th of  September and went from the lower floor to the ball and   visited every part of the building for public inspection. I walked  through the Whispering Gallery where a person can hear a  whisper from any part of it and when the door shuts  it penetrates the ear like peels of thunder.    On the 25 of August we attended a meeting  of the Temperance Society, at their Hall which we engaged,  but could not have it until the 7th of the next month. Br Smith  made a short speech. On the following day, we started out to try to  get some doors opened for preaching. Brother Kimball  went to one part of the city and brother Smith and myself  to another. We called upon two Baptist Ministers and  asked one for his chapel. In the evening we attended a   Methodist meeting in Song Lane    Next day we again went to the Temperance  Hall, in St George's Road, near the Elephant & Castle, and by the  request of the meeting  ^comittee^ I addressed the meeting upon the subject  of temperance, followed by George A Smith. We gave out  an appointment to preach the Gospel at that place Sep the 7th    The day after we all started out to go  through the city of London to see if we could find a  man with the Spirit of God; and after wandering through  the city, not Knowing whither we went, we came upon a  man and stoped him and spoke to him. Brother  Kimball asked him if he was a preacher? He said 
 On the 2nd of April I baptised 3 in ^Apperly^  and 6 in Leigh and then walked to Twigworth and preached  and afterwards returned to Leigh.    Two days afterwards I baptised eleven women  at Gadfields Elm and on the next which was Sunday I met  for prayer-meeting at Leigh.    After meeting we went to a brother's for  the purpose of again administering the ordinance of baptism  Ten prepared for the ordinance but before we closed singing  and prayer a desperate mob gathered together of about a hundred  and the owner of the pond would not let us baptise while  such a mob was present fearing serious consequences    I then went in search of water in other  places for about of an hour with the mob following me, and  railing against me; but I could not find water and we had to  defered it until the aftermoon. The mob commenced fitingghting  among themselves and the people sent for constables to clear  the ground.    After this I went to Norton and  preached and then returned to Leigh and the man gave his  consent for me to baptize in his pond    We went immediately to the water and  as I commenced to baptise the mob began to gather but I  succeeded in the administering the ordiance to nine persons  while surrounded by the rabble. I did not however receive  any injury nor did any of those baptised receive any  molestation except with the tongue. In the evening I preached  to a large congregation and the power of God rested upon us    The next day I baptized 5 more one  of whom was a preacher and another was a clerk in the Church  of England and two days afterwards I baptized seven more ^others^ and  preached to a large congregation    The day after I received two letters  one from Elder Willard Richards and the other from Elder John  Taylor in which I was informed of the arrival of five of  the Twelve and one of the Seventies. I was also advised that  they had appointed a Conference at Preston on Wednesday the 15th  of April and wished me to attend. 
 Sun all had the privilege of returning to their homes who felt so  disposed. The rest were to spend the night in the House of the  Lord in prayer exhortation praise and thanksgiving.    At about candle-light the meeting commenced  with great interest. Joseph requested the congregation to speak their  feelings freely and pray according to the Spirit.    The Saints then began to open their mouths and they  were filled with language unto edification. One had a prayer another  an exhortation another a doctrine some a psalm others a tongue  and some an interpretation. Prophecy was also poured out upon  us and all things were done decently and in order. Thus was  the night spent glorously by the Saints; and the meeting having  continued until break of day we all dispersed to our homes with great  joy and consolation    The next day I spent in writing my Journal  until evening when I went up to the House of the Lord inwith  Elders Milton Holmes and Joseph B. Nobles. We were afterwards  joined by an aged father in Israel by name Freeman Nickerson  who was very faithful and a man of much prayer. Before  he joined us the power of Satan strove much against us; but  our faith and peseverance in the Lord overcame him and we  were as baptized with the Holy Ghost    When we first entered the House of the Lord  we entered one of the Stands within the veils and fell upon our  knees but the Evil One strove against us with so much power  and temptation that at one time I was driven from my  stand. But notwithstanding his apparant victory good grew  out of it for by going into the courtyard I found father Nickerson  whom I solicited to join us that we might gain a victory over  Satan. He joyfully accepted the invitation and we were now  four in number and of one accord. Moreover we had great  cause to be united in heart for we had travelled together about  one thousand miles in the Spring of 1834 for the redemption of  Zion. At that time we offered to lay down our lifes and   our offerings were accepted as was Abraham's [##Genesis 22##] and now we could  unitedly prevail and obtain a blessing through Jesus Christ.  We fell upon our knees and cried mightily unto the Lord and  the Evil one departed and the Spirit of God within us was like  fire shut up in our bones and many great things was shown unto  us by the Holy Ghost and minifested in prophecy and revelation 
 he was. He seemed to have a good spirit, and informed us  that he had been to America, and had come to London for  the purpose of going to South Australia, but had just burried  one child and another laid at the point of death. Brother  Kimball told him his child should live. He gave us some  information where we could preach. On the same day we  called upon him and found his child better, but he was  not at home. We then went and heard a Calvinest preach  and he gave us an invitation to call and see him    Next day we again went over the city to see  if we could any of the children of God. We found one man  and his household who received our testimony, and he opened  his doors for us to preach. We appointed a meeting at his house  for Sunday evening. His name was Corner, and he lived at  52 Ironmonger Row, St. Luke's Parish, near the church.    Foundation of the Church  in   The City of London.    We had spent twelve days in going to and fro  London trying to find a people willing to receive our testimony,  but finding the doors shut against us, we determined in  the name of God to into the streets and lift up our voices    Accordingly Elders Kimball, Smith, and myself  started out on Sunday morning, August the 30th; walked  three miles and stoped in Tabernacle Square, Old Street, where  we found an Aitkenite preaching to the people, who was  followed by a Presbyterian. Just as the latter was about to  begin, Elder Kimball informed him that there was a preacher  from America present who would like to speak when he  got through. The preacher then informed the peopele that  there was an American minister present, and proposed that  he should speeak first. Elder George A Smith then got into  the chair, and spoke about 20 minutes, and then the Presbyterian  spoke. George A. had informed the people that there were  two other American Preachers present who would like to  address them; and, when the Presbyterian had closed, Elder 
 After preaching the niext night to a large congregation  many wished to be baptised but could not on account of the mob but  some wished to be baptised notwithstanding the persecution    At about twelve o'clock at night I went to the  pond to baptise. It was surrounded by a desperate mob and I baptised  five persons in the midst of a shower of stones one of which hit me in  the head and ^which nearly^ knocked me down with the man whom I was baptised [baptizing]    The next day I baptised 3 and I rode to Wolver-  ampton and then took rail to Stafford. Here I found ten thousand  people gathered to witness the hanging of two men. I came as near  to the jail as I could and in a few minutes they came upon the  scaffold and almost immediately they were lanched into eternity    The gallows remained until 3' oclock when  it was removed I went into the jail and had an interview with  Elder Turley who had been falsely imprisoned upon a warrent for  debt which had been contracted fifteen years before he left England  and which he supposed was settled    I spent the night with brother Hulme and  having spent the two next days in this district I took coach with  Elder Clark for Manchester and then being joined by Elder Clayton  we took the cars for Preston.    On the 14th of April eighteen hundred  and forty there was held  The First Council of the Twelve Among the Nations    There was ^were^ present at this council Elders Brigham  Young Heber C Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt Wilford  Woodruff John Taylor and George A. Smith    Elder Brigham Young was called to the  chair to preside and John Taylor was chosen as Secretary.    The Council was opened by prayer from  Brigham who was unanimously chosen as the Standing President of  the Twelve and Elder Willard Richards was ordained to the Quorum  of the Twelve by unanimous voice and according to a previous  revelation from the Prophet Joseph    At the first sitting of the Council it was  resolved that he who may act as the Secretary of the Quorum shall 
 Sunday April the 9th I attended service in the House of the Lord. In the   afternoon Elders Heber C. Kimble^all^ and Orson Pratt was followed by Sidney  Rigdon. He laid before them their situation as to temporal things said  that the Gentiles were besieging the Saints and would gladly starve them to  death; that the Presidency had used every means for the deliverance of the   Church; but that as many of the Church had refused Kirtland currency which  was designed for our temporal salvation they had put strength into the  hands of our enemies and thus the community must suffer by it.    Joseph then arose and like the Lion of the Tribe of Judah  poured out his soul in the midst of the congregation of Saints. While  listening I thought "Who can find language to write his words and teachings  as with an iron pen in a rock that they might stand for future generations  to look upon." He seemed a fountain of knowledge from whose mouth  streams of eternal wisdom flowed; and ^as^ he stood before the people  he showed that the authority of God was upon him. When speaking  of those who had professed to be his friends and the friends of  humanity but who had turned traitors opposed the curancy and  consequently the prosperity of Kirtland he proclaimed that the Lord  would severely deal with. Joseph uttered the feelings of his soul  in pain whie viewing the poverty and afflictions of the Saints  and in finding false brethren like whitened ^sepulcher^ whose course brings  perils upon the Church. [##Matthew 23:27##] Joseph is a father to Ephraim and  to all Israel in these last days and he mourned because of  unbelief and the negligence manifested by many who have received  the Gospel and be feared lest but few be left of those in Kirtland  to recieve an inheritance. I wrote in my journal of this day,  "There is not so great a man as Joseph standing in this generation.  The Gentiles look upon him and he is like a bed of gold concealed  from human view. They know not his principle his spirit,  his wisdom his virtue his philanthropy nor his calling. His  mind like Enoch's expands as eternity and only God can  comprehend his soul.    MY MARRIAGE.    Marriage being an institution of Heaven and honorable  withal on the 13th day of April 1837, I joined hand with Miss  Phebe W. Carter in the bonds of holy matrimony. My first  acquaintence with my wife was on the eve of the 28th of 
 Kimball asked him if there would be any objection to our preaching  there at 3 o'clock. He answered "No;" not at all. What  denomination do you belong to?" "To the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter Day Saints" was the reply    "Oh I have heard of them" he said. They are  "a bad people; they have done much hurt; they divide churches;  "we don't want to hear you."    He then mounted the chair again and said   to the people,    "I have just heard that the last man who spoke  belongs to the Latter-Day Saints;" and then he began to rail  against us.    Elder Kimball asked him to let him stopedep  into the chair to give out an appointment for a 3 o'clock  meeting, but he would not let him. Brother Kimball then  raised his voice and informed the people that some American  preachers would preach there at 3 o'clock. and at the appointed  time we were at the place.    The conduct of the preacher and  the excitement upon the subject brought together a large   congregation to hear us.    I opened the meeting by singing and  prayer and spoke about 20 minutes, from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal I. 8, 9 v## and  was followed by Elder Kimball for about the same length of  time. The people gave good attention and seemed to be  much interested in what they heard    After meeting Mr Corner invited us home  but soon after we arrived at his house, Elder Kimball  felt impressed to return to the place of preaching    When he got there he found a large company  talking about the things which they had heard, and they wished  him to speak to them again. He did so and addressed  them at considerable length, and afterwards several invited  him home to their houses.    While he was away a man who had been  a preacher came to Mr Corner's and I gave him a brief  account of the great work of God in the last days and  they received the things which I spake unto them. 
 prepare the minutes of its conferences and deposit them  in the hands of its President for keeping.    It was also moved by Heber C. Kimball  and seconded by Willard Richards that twenty of the  Seventies be sent for and that it be left discretionary  with the President of the Twelve to send for more should  he think proper.    On the next day of the Council Elder  Heber C. Kimball presided and William Clayton was  chosen as clerk.    The meeting was opened by singing and  by prayer from Elder Kimball who then called upon the Elders  to represent the different Branches of the Church.    First Representation of the  Churches in England    Elder Joseph Fielding represented the Church in  Preston consisting of about 300 members 7 Elders 8 Priests  6 Teachers and 2 Deacons.

 January 1837 when I was introduced to her of Elder Millikens  by the politeness of Elder Milton Holmes. After two and  half months acquaintance we were united in matrimony.  Johnathan Holmes was married at the same time to Miss  Mary Carter. The ceremony was performed at the house  of the Prophet Joseph by President Frederick Williams. The  Patriarch Joseph then blessed us in the name of the Lord  and pronounced great blessings upon us and our posterity  The Prophet himself was to have solemnized the ceremony  but his life was so sought and beset by wicked men  that he was under the necessity of fleeing from his house  and home for a few days.    We were married at 2 o'clock in the afternoon  and at 4 o'clock the whole company consisting of about  sixteen couple walked from President Joseph Smith's to  President Sidney Rigdon's where we witnessed the marriage  of Elder George Robinson and Miss Thalia Rigdon who  was also married by President F. G. Williams. At the setting  of the sun the company dispersed and    THE  PATRIARCHAL BLESSING  of  Wilford Woodruff  Given April 15th 1837    At a Blessing Meeting held at the Lord's House in Kirtland Ohio,  BY  Joseph Smith Sen  PATRIARCH of the CHURCH. 
 Mr Corner offered himself for baptism. This was the  first man in the city of London who offered himself  for the ordinance of the Gospel. We appointed the next  evening to administer the ordinance of baptism unto him  After supping with him we returned home by way  of London Bridge which was so crowded as also were the  streets that it was difficult for a person to get along    I was weary when I arrived home  and unwell during the night, but felt thankful unto the  Lord for the privilege of preaching to the inhabitants of  this great city and to have gained one soul as a seal  to our ministry    On the 31st being the next day we  repeated the first fruits of our labours and as it were laid  the first living stone of the Church of Jesus Christ in  England's great metropolis    We walked into the city and called upon  Mr Corner; but on our way we received a letter from  sister Eliza Bromley in which she stated that she had  dreamed that we should soon baptize a man who would  do much good. After reading the letter and arriving  at the house of Mr Corner he went forward with us  to the public Baths and received the initiatory ordinance  of the Gospel. He was    The First Man Baptized in London  and under the hands of Elder Heber C. Kimball    Returning to the house of brother Corner  we all three laid our hands upon his head and confirmed  him a member of the Church. We all returned to our  homes that night, specially thankful unto God for  his goodness in blessing our labours even thus much    September the 1st I took a walk in the  afternoon with Elders Smith and Kimball to see some of  the great works of man. We visited    The Thames Tunnel    one of the greatest wonders of the world.  We entered the Tunnel on the South side 
 by Elder Francis Clark    The Church at Barnly numbered 24 members  1 Priest and one Teacher; the one at Blackbaurn 15 members and  1 Priest; the one at Keighly and Thornly 29 members 2 Elders  1 Priest 1 Teacher 1 Deacon; Waddington 50 members 2 Priests  2 Teachers and 1 Deacon; Clithero 27; Cletburn 84  Cletburn 84 members 1 Elder 2 Priests 2 Teachers 1 Deacon; the  Dunham Branch 20 members 1 Teacher and 1 Deacon; and the  Branch at Grindleton 5 members.    These Branches were represented by Elders Richardson,  Moon, J. Smith, Ellison and Thomas Smith.    The Church at Manchester consisted of  240 members 2 Elders 5 Priest 4 Teachers 1 Deacon; The Branch  at Stockport 40 members 1 Priests 2 Teachers 1 Deacon; Duttonfield  30 members & 1 Priest; Altringham 8 members 1 Priest  and 1 Teacher; The Church at Pever and Macclesfield  30 members and 3 Priests; and the Middlewich Branch six  members. These were represented by Elder William Clayton    The Church at Elton [blank] consisting  of 12 members was represented by Elder David Wilding    The Church in the Potteries was represented  by myself, numbering 101 members 1 Elder 2 Priests 4 Teachers  1 Deacon. Herefordshire numbered 160 members 1 Elder and  two Priests. Forty of these Saints were Methodist Preachers of  the United Brethren. The Herefordshire Church was also  represented by me with its forty-two places of worship licensed  according to law    The Liverpool Church consisting of  28 members was represented by Elder John Taylor.

 of the River Thames at Rotherhithe and after going about 800 feet  down into the earth we entered the archway on the left 1120 ft.  of which was finished. It was beautifully lighted up with gas. We  walked through the Tunnel with the River Thames and the shipping  over our heads and in some places there is not more than  fifteen feet between the top of the arch and the bed of the river  There are two archways running the whole length of the Tunnel  with openings affording free communications from one archway  to the other: At the time we visited the Tunnel it was  considered of the kind one of the most gigantic and wonderful  of human achievements. Visitors to this place of note in after  years are familiar with a grand Bazar not there at the time  we visited it and Thames Tunnel purchases of Jewelry toys and  fancy things are carried away by the visitors to all parts of  the world as curiosities of association with one of the wonderful  places of London and momentoes of their purchasers visits to the  Great Tunnel under the monarch of England's rivers.    About under In the centre of the River Thames we wrote  in a record our names professions and residences and when  we came out we went to the Tower of London in a boat, the  distance being about 2 miles. We did not spend much  time here for it was getting late and we could not  therefore go through all the different appartments    Next day I was quite ill. I had been  unwell for several days but now I was obliged to keep to  my room; but Elders Kimball and Smith went into the  city to visit the people and found some who hearkened  to them favourably. We had by this time found that  London was the hardest place for a mission which we had  ever undertaken, but we did not feel discouraged in the  least; and were determined in the name of the Lord to set  up the standard of the Kingdom in that city    The following day I was still confined to  my room most of the dtime but on the next Elders Kimball  and Smith went to Debtford, and I took a walk into the  city called upon Brother Corner and found him in good   spirits.    I also called upon Mr Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,  Basin, who was a director of a Methodist chapel. I asked 
 Elder Willard Richards having been ordained  into the Quorum of the Twelve Hyrum Clark was appointed  Counsellor to Elder Fielding in the Presidency in the place  of brother Willard.    Upon motion from Elder Fielding seconded  by Brigham Young it was determined that a Hymn book  be published and farther motioned that it be done under  the direction of the Twelve. A monthly periodical was  also proposed.    Several ordinations were attended to  in the afternoon's Council.    Heber C. Kimball laid before the  conference the importance and propriety of ordaining a  Patriarch to give Patriarchal blessings to the fatherless and to  the Saints according to the dictation of the Spirit    After various remarks Bleazard Corbridge  was chosen by the Twelve to fill the Patriarchal office and  President Fielding and his Counsellors proordained him.    On motion by Brigham Young seconded  by P. P. Pratt it was agreed that the next Conference should be  held on the 6th of July at Preston but it was subsequently  arranged to be held at Manchester.    The next ^day^ the 16th of April the Council  of the Twelve held its last sitting prior to the adjournment    Brigham Young proposed and John Taylor  ^seconded^ that Parley P. Pratt be chosen as the Editor of the monthly periodical  for the Church. Elder Kimball moved and P. P. Pratt seconded  that a committee of three be appointed to make a selection of  Hymns and Orson Pratt proposed and Willford Woodruff  seconded that Brigham Young P. P. Pratt and John Taylor  be that Committee    Elder Willard Richards proposed that  the name of the periodical be the Latter-day  "Latter-day Saint's Millennial Star"    George A Smith seconded this motion  and Brigham motioned and Orson Pratt sustained that 
 him for the chapel to preach in. He said he had a school house  which would ^hold^ 500 and that I might have that on Sunday. So  I gave out an appointment at Bowl Court 137 Thornditch. I  conversed with several others who received my testimony  and one woman said she would be baptized    I returned home by the way of Smithfield  market which covers about 20 acres of ground. It was  Fair time and I never saw such a sight before. There  were 20 acres of ground covered with cattle sheep and  caravans of beast of every name and large bands of music  belonging to these "Shows" were playing to call the people  to the exhibitions of the numerous manageries which had  gathered from all parts of the country to the Smithfield  Market Fair. The^re^ was also a conglomeration of everything  there. I thought, "Could a Missourian from the western  wiles of America whose Knowledge extended only to his  gun, corn, crib and hog-pen behold such a shight he  would think himself in another world and perhaps retire  heart-sickened with the scene as I did; and no man who  loved virtue peace and retirement could feel otherwise in  viewing a scene like the Smith field Market Fair. Yet  Fairs are yearly heald in every part of the nation and in  fact they form one of the venerable institutions of the  land. They are some of the "good old English relics" and  are strikingly pictorial of "Merry England" of olden times  ^English^ Fairs are more plebian and belong more exclusively to the  peasantry and lower classes them English "Races". The latter  through just as much a national institution of the peasantry  and masses of England as the former also is a national institution  with the higher classes. The English Race course is not only  crowded with the tens of thousands of plebian stock but the   crowds of nobility fashionable society and sportsman from  all the country around will be there gathered on race days  But English Fairs and English Races from a moral point of  view are about on a level and there are none of the old  national institutions of that country so illustrative of the  type of "Merry England" in olden times. They are in  fact pictorial to the last shade of colouring when viewed 
 the size and price of the paper be left with the Editor.    On motions from Brigham Young seconded by  Heber C Kimball and P. P. Pratt it was determined that the Saints  who desired to emigrate should receive a recommend from the Church  in Britian to the Church in America and that no one should  be recommended to go to America who had money unless they  assisted the poor according to the counisel of the Twelve.    John Taylor motioned that the copyright of  the Books of Mormon and Doctrine and covenants be secured  as soon as possible. Parley P. Pratt sustained the motion;  and Willford Woodruff farther moved that Heber C. Brigham Young  Heber Kimball and Parley be the committee to secure the copyright  Willard Richards sustained this motion    Heber C. Kimball proposed and Willard  Richards seconded that Elder Peter Melling be ordained an Evangelical  Minister in Preston.    It was also proposed by Willard Richards  and seconded by Willford Woodruff that the Editor of the Millenial  Star keep an account of all the receipts &c connected with printing  and general expences and that the books at all times be open to  the inspection of the council of the Twelve.    All the foregoing resolutions were unaminously  adopted.    The total number of the Saints in England  and Scotland were 1671 including the Priesthood. The official  members were as follows    Elders 34; Priests 52  Teacher 38; Deacons 8  Total of Priesthood 132    The Council of the Twelve closed its  first conference among the nations on the 16th of April having  been convened three days. I felt happy to have the privilege  of sitting with my brethren of the Twelve to consult upon  the establishing of the work of God among the nations and  kingdoms of the earth and it was with much satisfaction that  I preached in the Temperence Hall to a crowded congregation on the  evening of the second day of our Conference. 
 as fine illustrative panoramas of "Merry England" in genuine "good  old English times." Now a day they are but the holliday realities  of the nation and are only relics of the past and not characteristics of  the present but in olden times fairs and races were the national  holliday pictures magnified of "Merry England" in every day life  Smithfield Market Fair as viewed by me that day was one of these  pictorials of the merry days of yore. It is years the scene was  repulsive to me but it was none the less illustrative of the  national characteristics of the past. In later years this fair  which was known by the name of Bartholemew Fair was  abolished by the muncipal authorities of London.    Visit to Westminster Abbey    September the 5th Elders Kimball Smith and  myself visited the Westminster Abbey. Here going through  every appartment we saw all the toomes and monuments  of the Kings Queens Princes Lords and noted men who have  ever been entommbed within its walls.    One part of the Abbey was built in the  year 600 and has now stood over 1200 years. Most of  the kings and queens of England are entoombed in  Westminister Abbey who have died during those twelve  centuries.    Here we saw what are esteemed perfect  likeness of Queens Elizabeth Mary and Ann, Lord  Nelson Pitt and others. We saw the full coronation  dress of Queen Ann and also the chair in which Queen  Victoria and all the Kings and queens for the last eight  hundred years were crowned. This chair of State is  covered with gold tissue and it contains a stone under  the seat in which all the Scottish chiefs and Scotland's  Kings were crowned since they were a people. Fabulous  tradition delclare this stone to be the identical stone that  was Jacob's pillar    In this chair of State in which Royalty had sat to  be crowned during eight hundred years we sat this  day yet not with any extravigant reverance for the 
 1840  CHAPTER XVI    [twelve blank lines]    As I am now entering upon that  part of my labours in the English mission where I became  associated with more of my brethren the Twelve in our  ministry in a foreign land I will here open a new  chapter by a brief  Summary View  of  My Mission in Herefordshire  prior to the Council at Preston.    Being led by the Spirit I visited  Froom's Hill Herefordshire on the 5th day of March 1840  and commenced preaching the word of God unto the people and  many received my testimony.  I commenced baptizing & In one month and five days I  had baptised 158 souls.    I baptized Mr Thomas Kington  the Superintendant of the Church of United Brethren which  came out of the Methodist connection. I also baptized  forty-eight preachers of the United Brethren and one hundred 
 held at meeting in Tabernacle square, at 3 o'clock, in the   afternoon at which Elders Kimball and Smith preached and  I bore my testimony to their words. One man arose  and opposed us, and was angry because of the truth of  God. He continued opposing, until the police stoped  the conversation.    We met again in the evening at Bowl  Court, to preach to the people, but when we got there we  found a plan contrived by several of the preachers for  one of them to preach, lest some should beleive our  testimony. When we found this, we went our way and  found four persons who received our testimony and  offered themselves for baptism    Next day I wrote to Elder Browett of  my Herefordshire field of labour and walked to Bro  Corner's and visited several other friends. Two offered  themselves for baptism. I visited St Paul's and then  returned home. Elders Kimball and Smith had  just returned from    A Visit to the Rev. Robert Aitken    He received them kindly, acknowledged their  doctrine true, but was affraid of deception. His mind  was in a disturbed state.    In the evening we held a meeting in  the Temperance Hall; but we had almost the bare  walls to preach to, there being only about thirty present  I preached to the few present for about an hour and  Elder Kimball followed me. After paying 7/6/ seven shillings  and six pence for the use of the hall we returned to our  lodgings.    Part of the next day we spent in  visiting places and things connected with the crown. We  started out together and walked to King St. and Union  St. and passed by Surry Chapel which was built and  occupied for many years by the celebrated Rowland Hill  whose body lies under this chapel    From thence we continued to Westminster  Bridge which brought us direct to Westminster Abbey 
 and twelve of the members of that Church.    This threw into my hands under my  superintendence forty-two places of worship already established  and licensed according to law including one regular chapel.    When I left this vast field of labour to  attend Conference at Preston there was ^were^ nearly 200 more persons  ready to enter into the Church; and among those already numbered  with us were the preachers of the United Brethren before mentioned  and one clerk of the Church of England and a number of wealthy  farmers    This opened the largest field of labour  and was the greatest increase of the Church in the British  Mission and when I left this vast field of labour to go to  Preston to attend Conference there were nearly two hundred  more souls ready to be baptized as soon as an opportunity  offered of whom after my return I found that Elder Kington  had baptized ten and Priest John Cheese twenty making  the number of souls belonging to the Church in Herefordshire  one hundred and eighty eight. I will now again take up  the regular thread of my history from my daily journal  for 1840.    I had spent the 14th 15 and 16th of April  sitting in Council with my brethren the Twelve and the Saints  who ghad come up to this general conference of the British  Mission; and on the evening of the 20^15^th I preached in the  Temperence Hall to a crowded congregation    On the 17th being Good Friday the Twelve  met at Penworthham two miles from Preston to visit the  Saints and spend the day together before they seperated for  their several fields of labour. Sister Moon opened a bottle  of wine for us to bless and partake of. This bottle of wine  she had kept for forty years. After spending the day  in conversing about the things of the Kingdom of God we  returned to Preston.    The time had come for the Twelve to seperate  and go into different parts of the Lord's vinyard. It was  thought widsom for Elder Heber C. Kimble to visist the Churches  which he had built up while in England on his former 
 and the House of Parliament. We walked through    the House of Lords and Commons    of England and sat in the chair in which the speakers of the house  of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the  speeches were made by that great orator William Pitt concerning  America before the revolution. As the House of Commons  was burned down about six years before our visit this room  iswas then occupied by the Commons and there was another  house built for the Lords at that time    One would naturally suppose that a  room fitted up to contain the Lords and Commons of  England would be extraordinary grand and expensive but  it is quite the reverse being exceedingly plain and undecorated    On entering the room one would sooner  think he was in an American School House than in  the House of the Lords of England    Next we visited St James Park and  saw a company of two hundred foot soldiers the Grenadier  Gards on parade accompanied by a fine martial band  Afterwards we saw the Queen's Horse Guards on parade  one hundred in number with their bodies covered  with steel which shone right martially. They wore  helmets and breastplates of steel which glistening in the  sun's rays made them appear as though they were encased  in polished armour; and they were mounted on powerful  black mares whose glosy coats and high mettle well  became the pride and pomp of war. It would be hard  to convince an Englishman that the Queen's Horse Guards  was not the finest regiment in the world. The charge  of the Guards at Waterloo is immortalized by the Wellingtonian  household tradition of "Up Guards and at them" which won  that famous battle upon which the destiny of Europe hung  and gave to the Iron Duke the crown of glory as conquerer  of Napoleon the Great. We may be told by those  who are sceptical to popular traditions that the great  Duke never uttered this famous command and we may   read that Welington himself was doubtful of the tradition still  the masses will beleive it and the "Up Guards and at them!" 
 mission and O[r]son Pratt to go North on mission to Scotland  John Taylor was to continue his labours in Liverpool and  Parley P. Pratt to proceed to Manchester and publish the  Millennial Star. (After years revealed that this new  periodical which was the first Church organ of foreign missions  was destined to live through many volumes and probably  will continue to be (as in 1865) the oldest periodical and  official organ in the Church. At the date of this transcript  it has passed through the hands of numerous editors and  has reached its twenty seventh volume.)    It was further arranged by the Twelve  that Elder G A Smith should go to the poteries and  Elders Brigham ^Young^ and Willard Richards go with me into  the field of labour which I had opened in Herefordshire and  the adjoining country    On the 18th I parted from the rest of  the Twelve who were to branch out in other directions  and with Brigham Young started on my return to my  fields of labour. We took train a^nd^ journied to Manchester  and then continued by coach to Burslem where we spent  the night at brother Johnstons    Next day being Sunday Elder B.  Young preached to the people of Hanly in the morning  and evening and in the afternoon we communed with  the Saints and spent an interesting time. We spent  the night at Stoke with Brother Hulme.    The following day we took coach at  Stoke and rode to Stafford and thence to Wolverhampton  where we stayed for the night and on the morrow we  proceeded by coach to Dudly and had a good view of the  old Dudly castle and from thence to Worcester in which  city we spent several hours.    Here we visited the ancient and noted  Worcester Cathedral which surpassed for splendor and  archetecture anything which I had ever viewed. Its length  is about 400 feet and this magnificient structure is between  [blank space] and yet in stands in our  own days in stately grander for surpassing the archetectural 
 of Wellington will live side by side on the page of national  tradition with Nelsons "England expects every man this day  to do his duty!" I thought the renowned Horse Guards  most certainly a magnificient regiment any how. They are  to the English Army what Napoleons "Old Guard" was to the  ^French^ but while the "Old Guard" of the Emperor was broken forever  at Waterloo, the Horse Guards of the grand Willingtonian  charge lived to do splendid service and maintain their  prestige in after years in the Crimean war fighting side  by side with the French whose Imperial head was  still a Napoleon as before. This time they were alies  and not foes yet then the French won from the English  some of the glory lost at Waterloo in spite of the fact  that the Queens Guards and the crack regiments of England  never behaved better, for instance that madly brilliant  Balaclavia charge at the Light Horse of the English army  In viewing and visitng the famous things and places of  London I always felt interested in their historical associations  and reminenscences    Passing from the martial view of the  Queens Horse Guards we visited the monument errected  in honour of the Duke of York which was 135 feet in  height. Here I parted from Elders Kimball and Smith and  walked the whole length of St James' Park. It has a  fine pond in the centre and mansions and palaces  around.    I first visited the palace of the  Queen Dowager widow of William the Fourth next the  mansion of the Duke of Sumerset ^Somerset^ which was quite  splendid and then Buckingham Palace. This palace  was occupied by Her Majesty Queen Victoria and His Highness  Prince Albert. It covers a number of acres of ground  and every door enterance and gate was strongly guarded by  armed soldiers    I walked nearly around this palace and  while doing so I had the privilege of seeing    His Royal Highness Prince Albert 
 of England there who manifested much of the Devil by stirring  up mobs against the Saints which had in several instances much  disturbed the meetings    On the 16 I had joined Elder Kington in  Dymock and that evening we were to hold at his house the  weekly prayer meeting of the Branch.    As we began to gather together the beating  of drums and kettles were heard through the street and the  mob soon collected and paraded in front of the house  We closed the window and shutters and doors in the house and  I opened the meeting with singing and prayer    But we had no sooner commenced than  the mob armed themselves with rocks bricks eggs and any  thing they could lay their hands upon and began to throw  them at the house like a shower of hailstones for nearly  an hour. They dashed in the windows scattered bricks and  glass through the rooms broke the tiles of the roof and  continued such depredations until the close of the meeting  The brethren being disposed to test the virtue of the laws  which were strict against such outrages I proposed to  go into the midst of the mob to see who they were but  they would not permit me lest I should receive injury  from the shower of stones. Several of the brethren  however went themselves and took down the names of  the leaders and returned to the house in the midst of a  volley of stones and brik-bats but without injury. Soon   afterwards the mob broke up and having cleared the room  of the bricks stones and glass we laid down to rest  and had a good night    I was at Froom's Hill on the 18th  and found the Saints in good spirits and learned that  Elder Turley had sailed from Liverpool on the 8th with a  company of 200 Saints. Brother and Sister Benbow  and the rest of the emigrant company were rejoicing in the  Lord and in their Zion bound journey    The 20th was well spent and was an  interesting day. I preached at Froom's Hill and communed with  the Saints and also at Standly Hill. 
 monuments of this age.    This cathedral contains many monuments  and marble sculptured figures over the toombs of ancient Bishops  Lords and Princes some of whom had laid there for seven  or eight hundred years. It is said that some of these monuments  with their marble sepulchre drapery are as neatly executed as any  found in Europe. Almost everything about this magnificient  chathedral from the dome to the basement is carved out of solid  marble. The pulpit is also hewn from solid stone. There  is a large organ in the building and the Church of England  hold service in it twice each day in the year. We staid during   one service.    From Worcester we rode to Ledbury and  on the road we passed through the town of Malvern on  Malvern Hill which commands the splendid prospect  of all the surrounding country for thirty miles on some  of the highest peaks of which are large entrenchments where  men retreted in the time of the Roman invasion. The   buildings in the village of Malvern are fine and very  picturesque in appearence standing on the side of these  ^hills^ Malvern is a noted place which the nobility and gentry  of England visit in the Summer season. We had  a view of Eastner castle as we past along. That night  we spent at Mr Francis Pullins in Ledbury    On the next day we walked to Froom's  Hill and called upon brother John Benbow and had an  interview with Elder Kington. In the evening we held a  Church meeting at Stan^d^ly Hill to do Church business. This  was the first meeting at which Brigham Young was  present in this district of country and I will therefore subjoin  the following minutes from my Journal:    Minutes of the First Meeting  Attended By Brigham Young  In Herefordshire  Standly Hill Branch  April 22nd 1840 
 He rode from the palace across St James' Park mounted on  a grey horse followed by his groom and was not accompanied by  Her Majesty or any other person. He was dressed in a frock coat  and dark pants. He looked fresh and healthy and in the  young Spring of life being only twenty years of age. I did not  see Queen Victoria for she was at Windsor Castle at this time.    I next visited the National Gallery and  viewed its choice and extensive collection of the best paintings of  the great masters of the art and afterwards St Martin's Church  when I concluded that I had seen as much as my brain could  contain for one day. Three miles walk farther through  the city brought me to Brother Corner's where I again joined  Elders Kimball and Smith. We spent a little time with the  friends and returned to our lodgings and spent the night.    My Return to Herefordshire    Next day September the 9th I paid my bills and   called upon the friends, in company of brothers Kimball and Smith,  and the day following I parted from the brethren and friends  in London to return to Herefordshire.    We had spent twenty three days in  that great Babylon of modern times and had found it harder  to establish the Church there, than in any place where  we had ever been. We had baptized one man, and ordained  him a priest; and six others had given in their names to  be baptized on the following Sunday; and at this time  there was some little prospect of the Reverend Robert Aitken  receiving the work. I, therefore, left London feeling that  our mission and labours had not been altogether in vain    I took the omnibus three miles  to the Great Western Railway Padington and at 9 o'clock  started for Herefordshire and as I passed Windsor Castle and  saw the British flag flying from it as signal that her  Majesty was there.    Arriving at Cheltenham at 4 o'clock  by coach from Farrinton road Station forty miles I met  Elder Browett and wife and several others of the Saints

The representation of the Branches of the Froom's Hill  conference was as follows:

President Young  opened the meeting by prayer when it was motioned by Elder  Wilford Woodruff and seconded by Elder Kington that James  Hill James Barnes Charles Price and John Parry be ordained  to the office of Priest and John Benbow to the office of Teacher  which was carried unamimously. Elders Brigham Young  and Wilford Woodruff then proceeded to ordain them to  the offices assigned to them. Priest Charles Price was also  chosen clerk of the ^Standly^ Hill Branch of the Church. The  meeting closed by prayer after which we walked to Froom's  Hill and spent the night.    On the next day Elder Young and myself  walked to Moorend Cross and called upon Brother Thomas  Kington ^Jinkins^. We both had a bad cold and felt ill  I left Brother Young and went to Colwall on the side  of Malvern Hill and preached. Before the meeting I  ascended to the top of the Hill and took an interesting survey  of the surrounding country. I returned to brother Kington's ^Jinkins^  and spent the night    The following day was occupied in writing  Brother Brigham wrote a letter to his wife in which I enclosed a  few lines to Phebe. I also wrote a seperate letter to her and sent  it to Commerce Illinois. I preached at Brother Jinkins where I stayed  that night and was quite ill as I was also the next day and night    Notwithstanding that I continued sick on  the morrow the 26th I walked five miles ^to^ and Ashfild and  preached at Mr Baily's and in the afternoon I walked to  GCrowcutt where I preached and baptized and confirmed ten  persons. One of those whom I baptized was a preacher. I  called and ^also^ ordained Edward Philips to the office of Priest. I returned  to Moorend Cross and passed the night at Brother Jinkins  having walked that day a distance of 12 miles and held two  meetings. Elder Young to day baptized four at Froom's Hill.  Thus the work of the Lord continued to advance in this  district of country.    On the 27th I was still quite ill with my  cold but I preached at Moorend Cross and baptized and confirmed 
 I was rejoiced on my return to the Churches to find that  the work was universally and rapidly progressing in Herefordshire  In some cases it was even reaching the nobility, and a lady  of title had become convinced of the work of God in our  ministry    On the 12th, two days after my  return I wrote from Leigh a historical letter to Elder  Kimball including my travels with him in London  This was the first letter I had ever written to him    The next day Sunday I met the  Saints at Leigh and communed with them and at  a neighbouring place preached in the afternoon at  2 o'clock to a large congregation. In the evening I again  preached at Leigh and 4 were baptized by Elder Glover  and I confirmed them    Minutes of  The Bran Green & Gadfield Elm Conference  of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  Sep 14th 1840    There were present one of the Twelve Apostles  one High Priest nine Elders nineteen Priests and  four Teachers    The meeting was called to order by  Elder Kington when it was moved by Willford  Woodruff and seconded by Elder Richardson that  Elder Thomas Kington be chosen the President of  this conference meeting which was carried unanimously  Elder Glover was chosen clerk    Willford Woodruff opened the meeting  by prayer and afterwards gave an address to the Saints  present.

 These two conferences, with their forty branch  churches, and over a thousand organized members, under  the direction of one hundred and thirteen ordained officers,  had been raised up inwithin six months and a half. Surely  the work of God had been marvellous, unparalleled  perhaps in the history of any new religious movement  unparalleled in the foundation of Christian churches of  every denomination either in ancient or modern times  To God the Giver of the power and efficacy of our  administration of the Gospel in Herefordshire and regions  around be the glory and not unto the humble ministers  of that work    I meditated upon these things and  in my journal of date Sept 21st 1840 I wrote thus:    "This has been a busy day with me. After  standing upon my feet from morning till evening I am  called to shake hands with hundreds of Saints with glad  hearts and cheerful countenances. It is with no ordinary  feelings that I meditate upon the cheering fact that  a thousand souls have been baptized into the New  and Everlasting Covenant in about half a year in one field  which God has enabled me to open. I pray Him to accept  the gratitude of my heart for his mercies and blessings  unto me in this thing and enable me to stand with  these Saints and all the righteous in His Celestial Kingdom"    This day I had stood upon my feet  eight hours in conference conversed much of the time in suggesting  ^speeking^ motioning &c; ordained about 30 confirmed some healed  many who were sick shook hands with about 400 Saints  walked 2 miles and ended with 4 hours of chimney corner  preaching. I then laid down to rest and dreamt of  catching fish.    Next day I was called upon to visit  a young man who lay dangerously ill and in danger  of the lockjaw from a cut of the ancle and bruise  of the knee. I rebuked the inflamation and pain of  the body and he was made whole. I baptized  Edward Jones a Game keeper and confirmed two 
 Next day I walked from Turkey Hall to Forty Green  and wrote a letter to Lady Roberts a companion of the  lady of Squire Dowdswell and sent it by the hand  of sister Brooks.    Lady Roberts was of the nobility of  England and a lady of wealth, and had withdrawn  from the Church of England and the travelled much  in search of truth looking for the fulfilment of the  Prophets.    She became acquainted with the fulness  of the Gospel through a female servant in the employ  of Squire Dowdswell. She began to investigate  the subject; and the Spirit of God rested upon her  and convinced her of the truth of the work. and sShe  obtained the 4 numbers published of the Millennial  Star and fearing that she should not be able to  obtain them for herself, copied the whole of them  with her pen. She also read the Book of Mormon  and copied a part of that, and became perfectly  convinced of the truth of the work of which she  read, and said she would go a thousand miles  but what she would see some of the Twelve and  be baptized under their hands. and hHearing that  I was in London she was about to take a journey  there to see me, and the other brethren, and be baptized  She had two brothers ministers of the Church of  England.    Having returned from London, I, therefore,   addressed her by letter upon the work of God, into which  at that time she was so earnestly entering, to which  she returned me a verbal answer by Sister Brooks, thanking  me kindly for the interest which I manifested in her welfare,  and saying that she should address me by letter in a few days    Elder Kington in Dymock had faithfully  warned the people and had succeeded in raising up a  church of fifty Saints. This had stired up the  inhabitants of that place to much anger against us  and especially the Rev. John Simons Rector of the church 
 The day following I was called upon to visit another  young man who lay dangerously ill with the fever. He  covenanted to keep the commandments of God and I  anointed him and rebuked the fever and he began  to recover. I also visited an aged Saint upon her  death bed and blessed her. She was rejoicing in  the fulness of the Gospel in death    The church ministers at this time were very  much stirred up in this region because of the success of the  work of God in the midst of the people and every exertion  were made by them to stay its progress. They were finding  that the Lord was delivering their flocks out of their hands  and giving them unto the shepherds of the church of the  Saints. They were alarmed and were holding conventions  and meetings to contrive plans and adopt means to over-  throw the Latter-day Work of God which they understood  not and beleived not yet feared its power. And well  indeed they might for in some instances they did not  have more than 10 or 15 at their churches on the Sabbath  while around them on every hand they had seen forty  Branch^es^ of two organized conferences of the Church of  Latter-Day Saints spring up in about six months with  over a thousand members and between one and two  hundred officers ordained to scatter the ^seed of the^ Gospel everwhere  upon the new broken ground of ^in^ this prolific field    On the 25th the time had come for  me again to take leave of the Saints in my Herefordshire  field of labour. I wrote an address to Elders Kimball  and Smith baptized one and confirmed two and after  visiting the Saints until midnight I took the parting  hand with them and started on my journey at 12 o'clock  at night.    I rode from Froom's Hill at night in  a cart to Worcester 15 miles took coach and thence 40 miles  to Wolverhampton. Here I rode 2 miles by the omnibus  to the railroad Station and travelled by rail 30 miles  to Whitmore Station where I again took omnibus 9 miles  to Hanley and then rode in a gig to Burslem.
