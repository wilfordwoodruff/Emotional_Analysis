 Apostle W. Woodruff read the 84th Section of the Doctrine andCovenants, Revelation given Sept. 22 and 23, 1832. Admonished thepriesthood who were called upon to preside to feed the flock.  We couldnot build up Zion without the power of God to assist us.  We oughtto be kind to one another, whether husbands, wives or children.  All thepowers of earth and hell combined could not prevent Zion fromprospering, and the judgements of God will come upon the wicked.The Lord will fight our battles.  We should study the scriptures.He expected to leave us in a few days to visit his northern home, andattend the Conference to be held in Salt Lake City.  He spoke of thegreat work that Joseph Smith and Brigham Young had performedin the earth in connection with the apostles and elders, and sometimesthose who profess to be Latter-day Saints speak evil of those who havepassed away.  This should not be.  Counselor John W. Young is herewith us.  He has built a woolen factory at Hoan Coppy, which is insuccessful operation.  He trusted it would be a benefit to the saintsand to the Lamanites.  Hoped he would be assisted in his business.En couraged the young to lead virtuous lives and the young mento marry the maidens.  The Lord will remember his convenants withthe house of Israel.  Thanked the Saints for the kindness extended to him. 
 Pres't Wilford Woodruff was glad to meet with the saintsof the stake, said, "We know no north, nor South amongthe saints." The nations will be chastized with afflictions,especially this nation. "I could not find the same Gospeltaught in my boyhood, that Jesus taught, but I havelived to hear, & embrace, & work in it near fifty years."We are here on a mission, We have great reasons to rejoiseWe have the Kingdom of God." spoke of the restoration ofthe Gospel by the ancient Prophets, of Joseph Smith'smission upon the earth, & in the spirit world. Spoke of the powersof the Priesthood into life, & salvation, of trials & prosperity ofthe saints. Encouraged them to faithfulness, & diligence. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff was delightedto see so many at meeting, spoke of the umpopularityof the principles of truth, & the afflications, & sufferingof our Savior, "In my boyhood I prayed a great dealto God, that I might be permitted to live in a day, &age in which ministers could be found who taughtthe same principles which we find in the new testa-ment, the Lord heard, & answered my prayer, & has grantedme that glorious priviledge, spoke of the magnitude ofthe labor, resting upon the L.D.S their mobility tofully comprehend the extent of their mission upon theEarth. the growth, & progress of the Kingdom of God."The Prophet Joseph Smith was reserved by our heavenly 
 father for 6,000 years that he through him might bringto light the fullness of the everlasting Gospel." Said itwas the duty of the Elders of Isreal to preach this gospelto all the nations of the Earth, & that Gods judgementswould follow their testimony. the suffering of the Jewsbecause they crucified the Savior. the day of theirredemption being nigh. the afflications, & Judgements ofGod upon America because of their having slain theProphet Joseph, said "It is necessary that we buildtemples in which to administer in behalf of the dead.God requires it at our hand, that we may stand asSaviors upon Mt.

 W. Woodruff (5 min past 1 a.m. of Tuesday) I have desired to see this dayand I would rather see this meeting adjourned. I had not seenhalf a dozen of these men, the Prophet, or Brother  Brighambut there was a strong spirit that rested upon us and we had noexperience, but I am glad I had sufficient faith to go, for I knewit was the work of God. Joseph was a plain simple man in hismanners, I have rejoiced from that day to this, we have a quarterof that company here. Would not there have been an offeringif we had set fire to our houses in this city? It would.When I heard the list read I mourned over those who had turnedaway. The promises given us this evening are sufficient for us toencourage us and I hope we shall have more like them.

 THEAUTOBIOGRAPHYOF WILLFORD WOODRUFFCHAPTER 1.My parentage, Birth, (The The misfortunes which befel me in early life,) And occupation. My Fathers familyI Willford Woodruff was the son of Aphek Woodruff, who was the son of Capt Eldad Woodruff, who was the son ofJosiah Woodruff. My Mother Bulah Thompson was the daughter of Lot Thompson All of which were born in the townof Farmington, Hartford Co, Connecticut. My Fathers family consisted of eight sons & one daughter viz Azmon Thompson & myself by his first wife, who Died ^with the spotted fever^ June 11th 1808, Aged 26. And married Azubah Hart for his secondwiffe who was the mother of Philo, Asahel Hart, Franklin, Newton, Julius, And Eunice, three of whichdied in infancy viz Franklin, Newton, & Julius. New^ton^ was drowned at two years of age. Philo Died Nov. 25, 1827being 17 years of age. Asahel Hart, Died at Terre Haute Ia Oct 18th, 1838, Being 24 years of age, leavingbut four of us among the living.My life commenced with the spring. I was born in the North part of the town of Farmington, now called Avon, March 1st 1807. Tho occupation of my Father was a miller from his youth upwhich occupation I followed untill AD 1831. Variant &and divers are the lives & fortunes of men in evry age of theworld, while the path of some are strewed with flowers & ease from the cradle to the grave, with naught to disturd theirpeace, others Apparrently are marked victims, of variated misfortunes, accident & dangers, the last named class isthe one in whose ranks I have stood through my infancy, childhood, youth & manhood nearly to the present timeso much so that it has seemed at times as though some invisible power or fate was watching my footsteps in orderto find some opportunity to take my life from the earth, But I can ownly attribut the continuation of my life on earth to thepresent time to a merciful Providence whose hand has ben stretched out & rescued me from death in the midst of themany dangers & hair bredths escapes which I have passed through in life, some of which I will here mention. When three yearsof age, I fell into a caldron of scalding water, was instantly caught out, &and so badly scalded, that it was nine nine monthsbefore the[y] considerd me out of danger of the effects of the accident. My fifth & sixth years was interwoven with many acci-dents. On a certain day in company with my elder Brothers I entered the Barn & chose the top of a hay mow for a placeof diversion. We had not been there long before I fell from the great beam upon my face upon the bear floor, which endedour sport for that day at least, however I shortly recoverd from the fall & a few weeks afterwords was again to playin the chamber of my Fathers House on Sunday with my Brothers Azmon & Thompson, and father reproved us for sodoing, but we were so busy we could not spend time to obey our fathers ^command^ advise, And whether we disturded him orwhether he thought of Solomons advise I know not but at all events he spared not the rod of correction, and beganto flog us. we started to go below, & as we came to the stairs I was behind & hence the blows fell on me and while makingan effort to get before my brothers I made a misstep & fell to the bottom of the stairs & broke one of my arms in the fall, so much for disobediance. It was not long before I recoverd from this misfortune & was about the streets againIt was but a short time before I narrowly escaped with my life. My father owned a stock of horned cattle 
 And among them was one cow which I called mine, one evening I accompanied my father to the barn, to fodder them. It being in the fall of the year we were feeding out pumpkins and among our stockFather had a large surley Bull, & while distributing the pumkpkins my cow got one & the Bull another, soonthe Bull came & got the one my cow had. I then went & got the one the Bull left, to give my cow No soonerhad I got it in my arms, than the Bull left his & came after me, I ran down a hill with all my might & the Bull at my heels my Father seeing my danger told me to throw down the pum^p^kin but feeling anxiousto see that my cow should have her right I still held on. Bullt while the Bull was approaching me withthe fierceness of a tiger I made a miss step fell flat upon the ground, the pumpkin rolled out of my armsthe Bull leaped over me run his horns into the pumpkin & tore it to peaces & probably would havedone the same by me had I not have fallen which escape like many others I attribute to the mercy & goodnessof GOD. It was during the same year that I was again under the necessary of employing a physicianwhile paying a visit at my Uncle Eldad Woodruff I was standing in a porch with one arm around apillar leaning over the railing my arm sliped off the pillar & I fell several feet across some timber &broke my other arm. One would naturly suppose by this time that I should begin to grow cauciousin my procedings. But not many months rolled around defore I was called to endure still heavierfate. My father owned a lumber sawmill in addition to his flowering mill, and one morning incompany with several other boys I went into the saw mill & got onto the head Block of the carriageto ride not anticipating any danger but before I was awere of it my leg was caught between thehead block & fender post & broaken short into, I was taken to the house & lay nine hours before my boneswer replased which time was spent amid severe pain, but being young my bones soon nit together& in few weeks I was again upon my feet as usual attending to the sport & of my youth. During my confinement with this lameness, my Brother Thompson was was my companion goingthrough a course of the tipus fever. Thus one scene of accident after another followed me throughmy youth from ymonth to month & year to year. I had occasion one dark evening to cross my fathersmeadow while doing so I run against an ox that was feeding the ox not knowing what it was concludedto defend himself with his heels, he kicked me in the bowels but I being so near him I was rather more frightenedthan hurt. Again my uncle had a load of hay to get in and for the want of help proposed for me to loadit. Although I was young I agreed to make the trial, & with his assistance I thought it loaded vary well butbefor he reached the barn he drove over a large stone & turned most of the hay over I fell onto the ground& the load top of me. But an exertion was made & the hay removed from me as soon as possible & Ionce more breathed a free element. While 8 years of age I accompanied my father with several othersin a one horse waggon about three miles from home to attend to some work, while on the way the horses decamefrightend ran dow a hill & turned the waggon over with us in it But again while in danger I was savedby the hand of providence none of us was injured. While in the days of my youth I cluimb^ed^ an elm treeto procure some bark & while about fifteen feet from the ground the limb deing dry upon whichI stood it broke & I fell to the ground upon my baccks which apparrently beat the breath out ofmy body A cousin that was with me ran to the house & told my parents that I was dead, but before my freinds got to me I had revived rose upon my feet & met them on the wayAt Twelve years of Age I was drowned in Farmington River & sunk in 30 feetof water and was almost miraclulously saved by a young man named Bacon I sufferedmuch in being restored to life. At Thirteen years of age while passing through Farmington 
 meadows in the debth of winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an excedingblustering day I became so chilled and overcome with the cold that I could not travel I cralwledinto the hallow of a large Apple tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into it hastened to merealizing more fully than I did the danger I was in. when he arived at the spot I had fallen asleep,& was nearly insensible he had much difficulty in arousing me to a sens of my situation. he procu-red means to convey me to my Fathers House and through a kind Providence my life was again pres[er]ved.At Fourteen years of Age I split my left instep open with an Ax which went nearly through my footit was about nine months getting well. I suffered much with it.At Fifteen years of age I was bit in the hand with a mad dog in the last stage of the hydrophobiabut he ownly dented my hand with his Teeth but did not draw blood & I was again preserved throughthe mercy of God from an awful deathAt the age of seventeen I met with an accident which caused me much suffering & came nearEnding my life I was riding very ill tempered horse whose temper & practices I was igno-rant of and while going down a vary steep rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the groundinstantly leaped from the road & ran down the steepest part of the Hill amid the thickest of the rocks atfull speed and he commenced kicking up at the same time & was about landing me over his head am[o]ngthe rocks but I lodged on the top of his head & grasp one hand hold of each ear as with a deathgrasp, expecting evry moment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks, while in this position setingAstride his neck with no bridle to guide him but his ears, he plunged down the hill among the rockswith all fury untill he struck a rock near breast high, which dashed him to the earth. I went overhis head about one rod and struck the ground square upon my feet being the ownly thing that savedmy life: for had I sruck the ground on any other part of my body it must have killed me instatly.as it was my bones crushed from under me as though they were reeds. I broke twoone ^one^ of my legs& one twice in two & put out both of my ancles in a shocking manner. And the horse came nighrolling over me afterwards in his struggles. An Uncle of mine saw me fall & hastened to myrelief, & got assistance & carried me to his house in an arm chair. I lay from 2 oclok in the Afternoontill 10 at night without aids then my Father arived bringing with him Dr. Swift of Farmingtonwho set my bones boxed up my limbs & carryed me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my Fathershouse my sufferings were vary great; yet I had good attendance & in 8 weeks was outdoorsupon my crutches, & soon was well again.In A.D. 1827 while I was tending a flouring mill for Aunt Wheeler in Avon Ct. I wasstanding upon one of the wheels clearing the ice off A man hoisted the gate & let a full head of waterupon the wheel which instantly started as the water struck it at the same instant my feet sliped into the wheelwheel. I immediately plunged head foremost over the rim of the wheel into about 3 feet of water & my weight drewmy legs out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft & crushed to deathIn AD 1831 while having charge of the flouring Mill at Collinsvill Ct. I was standing insideof a Breast wheel 20 feet in diameter upon one of the Arms near the top clearing the ice out of it whenA full head of water was let onto it it immediately started I droped my ax and leaped to the bottomof the wheel by the shaft & arms near 20 feet. As I struck the bottom of the wheel I was rolledout against a ragged stone wall with ownly two feet clearance between it & ^the^ wheel the wheel caughtme and rolled me out into the water below whare I found myself without any broaken bonesbut with some bruises and much fright 
 In Dec A.D. 1833. The day that I was Baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter DaySaints. One of my horses newly calked kicked my hat off my head and had he strucktwo inches lower would probably have killed me instantly. In Ten minutes after while driving the samehorses down a hill on a sled with loose bottom boards without a box the boards slip'd forward under the rollcaught the ground turned endways & fell on the horses backs throwing me between them under the sledthey run to the bottom of the hill draging me by the lines head foremost with the sled top of me abo[u]tTwenty rods over a vary smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangersIn 1834 while travelling in Zions Camp to Missouri A rifle was accidentally discharged & theball passed through Three tents with a dozen men in each & lodged in a waggon Axletree without injuryto any one it passed within a few inches of my breast & many others escaped quite as narrow as myselfa few months after a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing at my breast withina few feet of me h[e]avily loaded with buck shot but it missed fire & my life was again preservedIn April 1839 while in Rochester Ill. I was riding upon the running part of a waggon withoutany box I was siting on the foreward Axletree and the boult came out fastning the four wheels togeththis left the hind wheels, & my weight on the forward boulster & tongue turned the coupling poleclear over onto the horses backs turned the stakes upside down & shot me up fast between the bolster &tongue but in such a manner that my head and shoulders draged on the ground my horses took fright & run out onto an open praire and they draged me in this position for about half of a mile when I managed to guide them so as to run them into the corner of a high worm fencewhare we landed in a pile together I was considerably brusised but escaped without any broakenbones and after one days rest was enabled to attend to my labour again.On the 15th day of October 1846 while with the Camp of Israel building up Winter Quarterson the west side of Missouri River then Indian Country, I passed through one of the most painful& serious misfortunes of any of my lifife.  I took my Ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the Bluffs to cutsome shingle timber to cover my cabins. I was accompanied by two other men and while falling the thirdtree I steped back of it some 8 feet whare I thought I was entirely out of Danger but when the treefell their was a kocrook in the tree which struck a knowl and shot and ways back of the stump and bounded & the but of the tree struck me in the breast & knocked me several feet in the air againsta standing Oak and the falling tree followed me in its bound & caught me against the standing tree andI came down between the two trees one falling & the other standing but before reaching the ground I wascleared from between them & struct upon my feet it badly bruised my ^left^ thigh the whole length of it& my hip. Also my left arm It also broke my breast bone into & 3 ribs on my left side it also bruised mylungs vitals & left side in a shocking manner. After the accident I sat upon a log untill Mr John Garrisonwent a quarter of a mile & got my horse, notwithstanding wI was so badly hurt I had to mount my hourse& ride two & a half miles over an exceding rough road & had to dismount twice in consequence of mireyplaces my breast & vitals was so badly torn to peaces that each step of the horse went through me like anarrow I continued on horseback untill I arived at Turkey Creek on the North Side of Winter quartersI then became exhausted & was taken off & carried in a chair to my house I was met in a thee streetby Presidents Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball W. Richards ^& others^ who assisted in carrying me to my waggon& family before laying me upon my bed they laid hands upon me & rebuked my pain & distress in 
 the name of the Lord & said I should live and not die I was then laid upon my bed in my waggonas my cabbin was not done, & as the Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live& not die I employed no physician on this occasion but was administered to by the Elders of Israel and nursedby my wife. I lay upon my bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to knit together which commenced on the 9th day I began to walk about in 20 days and in 30 days from the time I was hurt I again commenced hard labourAnd it has always appeared mirraculous to me that with all the injuries & broaken bones that I have had thatI now have not a lame limb about, but me, but have been enabled ever since to endure the hardest man-uel labour, exposures, hardship & Journeies, have even walked 40, 50, and on one occasion 60 miles ina day, however if I overlabour or take a severe cold I feel it more sensibly in my breast & left side thanI did before my last injury. Thus I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstanceswhich have attended me during life and to sum the matter up it stands about thus, I have broaken bothlegs (one twice in two) both Arms, both Ancles, my breast bone & three ribs, have been drowned, froze, & scalded,have been in two waterhwheels while turning under a full head of water & have passed through a score of otherhair breadths esscape yet the mercies of God have been over me, & my life has thus far been preserved onthe Earth For which blessing I feel to render the gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my Heavenly Father praying that the remainder of my days may be spent in his service & the building up of his KingdomCHAPTER II.My experience and Reflections upon religious subjects previous to hearing & embracing the fulness of theeverlasting gospel as tought & practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saintsAt an early age my mind from time to time began to be exercised upon religious subjectsbut I never made a profession of religion untill AD 1830 being 23 years of age. I did not then Join any church for the reason that I could not find any body of People, denomination, or churchwho had for their foundation, doctrines, tenets, faith, & practices: that gospel, faith, principles, practicesordinances, gifts and foundation which the Ancient Apostles Prophets & Saints Taught, enjoyed andheld forth as the gospel of Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and its attendant gifts and graces. And wheneverI conversed with ministers of the various denominations or sexcts they would universally tell me that prophets,Apostles, Revelations, Healing the sick &c were given to esstablish Jesus Christ & his doctrin & have ever since beendone away and no longer needed in the church & Kingdom of God. This Argument I could not, nor, neverdid believe. But I did believe that Revelation, the gifts, graces, & faith once deliverd to the saints which theyhave enjoyed in all former Ages when God has hasd an acknowledged people on Earth has been doneaway ownly through the disobedience and unbelief of the children of man I believed evry gift Office andblessing just as necessary to constitute a true church of Christ and Kingdom of God in our day & gener-ation as in any age of the world. This principle & belief was firmly rivited upon my mind from twocauses, first from the perusal of the bible whare I found cause and effect alike in all past ages and the samepromised in all generations to come. At the same time I could not find any change of the gospel or the planof salvation in the days of Christ & the Apostles or that their would be any change in the ordinances of thegospel or plan of saving men in the last days. I learned from the scriptures that many of the AncientProphets, & Christ and the Apostles, did foresee by Inspiration & Revelation and did prophesy that the GentileNations as the Jews had done would would Apostatize & turn away from the true faith and church and 
 Kingdom of God that thare would be a falling away from Apostolic faith Doctrins and ordinancesand that other systems would arise in its stead, and when these fals systems had arived at theirfullness than would "the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom which should become an Everlasting Kingdomto whose dominion should be no end." 'Then should this gospel of the Kingdom be preached in allthe world as a witness unto all Nations before the End should come" Then should the church comeup out of the wilderness and be esstablished upon the foundation of the Ancient Apostles & ProphetsChrist Jesus being the chief corner stone. Also that the same gospel and Kingdom of God withall its attendant blessings & promises that was taken from the Jews (who had fallen through unbelief)and given to the gentiles who brought forth the fruits of that Kingdom for a season but when theyfell away in like manners through the same example of unbelief Then the gospel & Kingdom of Godwill be taken out of the hands of the Gentiles as Nations and again be restored to the Jews with all theHouse of Israel And that when this gospel & Kingdom was restored to the Jews it would possessall the powers gifts blessing & ordances which it did possess when it was taken from them.These things I did learn from the perusal of the scriptures which made a lasting impression upon mymind. Another cause for these principles being planted in my mind was I was taught in the days of my youth by an aged man by the name of Robert Mason who lived in Syimsbury C.t.He was called by many a Prophet and many of his prophesies have since come to pass to mycertain knowledge. through fasting, prayer, & the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus Christ thesick were healed, and devils were cast out under his Acdministration, even his own son who hadbecome a raving maniac after praying & fasting for nine days in his behalf He arose from his bed onthe ninth day & rebuked the ^evil spirit^ devil & commanded the devil to come out of him in the name of Jesus Christand it instantly obeyed him & he was made whole from that hour. This man instilled those principlesinto my mind also into the mind of my Elder Brother Azmon Woodruff ^and Many others^. He did not believe the church& Kingdom of God in its organized form was among man on the Earth. He considerd that he had noauthority to administer in any of the ordainances of the Gospel and knew of No man that had, butbelieved it his privilege or the privilege of any man who had faith in God to fast and pray for thesick by the laying on off hands, and to pray for light knowledge truth visions & revelations. He told methe day was night when the Lord would again esstablish his church and Kingdom on the Earth withall the gifts & graces that were manifest in the days of the Savior. He said it would commence upon theEarth before he died but ithe would not live to enjoy & partake of its blessings but said thatI should & that I should become a conspicuous actor in that Kingdom. The last time thatI ever saw him He related to me the following visinon which he had in his field in open day"He said I was carried away in a vision & found myself standing in the midst of a vastorchard of fruit trees I became hungry & I wandered through the vast forest of fruit treessearching for Fruit to eat but I found notone & while I stood gazeing in amazement at notfinding any fruit amid so many trees they began to fall prostrate around me as though they weretorn up by a whirlwind & they continued to fall untill there was not a tree standing in the whole forestI immediately saw young shoots spring up from the roots which formed themselves into young &beautiful trees and they immediately budded, blossomed & bore fruit which ripened to maturity whichwas the most beautiful of ^to look upon^ of any thing my eyes had ever beheld and I stretched forth my hand & pluckedsome of the fruit, & I gazed upon it with delight, and as I was about to eat of it the vision closed& I did not eat of it at all. I found myself in my field at the close of the vision and I bowed down 
 Before the Lord and I called upon his Holy name and asked him to make known unto me the meaming of the vision. And the voice of the Lord came unto me saying, Son of man thou hast saught diligently to knowthe truth concerning my Church & kingdom among man, this is to show you that my Church is not organizedupon the face of the earth in the generation in which you live, neither is the true fruit of the kingdom of God mademanifest among the people; but in the days of your children even the rising generation shall the Church & kingdomof God be made manifest, revealed and esstablished upon the Earth among the children of men, then shall thetrue fruit of the vine & the gospel of Christ be given unto all those who will receive it & obey the ordinances of theGospel of Salvation. You will live to bea made acquainted with it but will not live to partake of it before you depart thislife, but you will be blessed of the Lord after death because you have followed the dictation of the Holyspirit while in life." when he had finished relating the vision He said to me I am satisfyed that you willstand in that Kingdom & assist in building it up, but I shall die before I partake of its ordinances, he thenblessed me in the name of the Lord & bid me farewell, it being the Last time that I ever saw him. This was in1828, and he was vary aged. In Dec in 1833 Zera Pulsipher came to Richland Oswego County New Yorkwhare I was then living He was holding the office of an Elder & he preached the gospel to us in that placeand I went forth & was Baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and almostthe first person I thought off was Father Robert Mason and on my arival in Missouri nas a memberof Zion Camp, I wrote a long letter to him & other friends setting forth the coming visitation ofthe Angel of God, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the esstablishment of the Churchof Christ & Kingdom of God, with the priesthood & all its attendant Blessings and all thingswhich I could think of connected with the esstablishment of the Church in its infancy. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] Theold Gentleman received the Letter with a great deal of satisfaction & had it read overmany times to him, & handled it (as he did the fruit in his vision) & rejoiced before the Lordbut he sonon died & had not an opportunity of receiving the ordinances from under the hands of anElder in the Church, but the first opportunity which I had I was baptized for him in the Font at Nauvoo.One of the most remarkable events of Father Masons Life was he said he was called to Fast fortydays, and he commenced to fast & pray with a determination to Fast the Forty days, but he fastedtwenty seven days without taking any nourishment or food, but on the twenty seventh day the Lordtold him to arise & eat for he had excepted his sacrafize as he did Abrahams. The Lord told himto kill a Lamb & cook & eat of it & he did so & his apetite came to him & he partook of a hartymeal without any injury to him & the next day he walked 10 miles. He considered that He fastedthe 40 days as Much as Abram offered up his son Isaac He felt that he could have fasted the40 days as well as the 27. [##Genesis 22:1-18##] There was a reasonableness in the teachings of this man which sofirmly agreed with the prophesies & teachings of the Ancient Prophets & Christ and the Apos-tles that I firmly believed them with all my heart, And I gave myself to the reading ofthe scriptures & Earnest prayer before God day & night as far as I had an oppertunityfor years before I herd the preaching of the fulness of the Gospel by a Latter Day Saint. Ihave plead with the Lord many hours, in the forest, among the rocks, in the fields, in the Mill &at midnight that He would give unto me light, truth, & the spirit of God to lead me in the wayof salvation And my Prayers were answered untill many things were revealed unto me & mymind was opened to the truth so much so that I was fully satisfied that I should live to see the trueChurch of Christ esstablished upon the Earth & a people raised up who would do the will of God & keep his commandments & who would bring forth the true fruit of that Kingdom 
 CHAPTER III.The various places in which I resided. My busines and manner of Life and experience up tothe time of my being baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day SaintsI spent my early life in the north part of Farmington now called Avon Hartford County Ctwhich was the plase of my birth, as soon as I was old enough to travel two miles to school (which wasthe distance to our district school house) I attended summer & winter with my two Elder Brothersuntill I was ten years of age, at which time My Father sold out his Property consisting of a sawmill, Flouring Mill, Carding Machine, & a large Farm & a stock of cattle this was done in order to payhis debts as he had become much involved by loaning money & undersigning men at the bankMy early sports consisted chiefly of angling for the spotted trout which abounded in the streamwhich fed my Fathers Mill Pond My Brother Thompson & myself were considered the mostsuccessful Fisherman of any persons who visited the Brook. During the winter season we would set boxtraps for gray Rabits & we caught a good many. My mind was rather more taken up upon these subjectsin my boyhood than it was in learning my books at school, for in those days Parents did not feel theimportance of looking after the Education of their children any more than merely to send them to schoolconsidering that the Education of their children was wholey depending upon the school master.when I was 8 years of age there was a revival of religion in our Neighborhood mostly conducted by the Baptistdenomination. Elder Brooker also Elder Quishman of Hartfort County Countynecticut preached at my Fathers Houseand baptized my step Mothers & several other relatives, both of my brothers made ^a^ profession of religionI attended their meetings, & prayed with the young People & tried to get religion but it soon wore off from mymind as it did from the mind of Brother Thompson But Brother Azmon was very faithful to his prayershis bible & his God through all the days of his youth & manhood up to the time of his embracing the fulnessof the everlasting gospel. My Father having sold out his property in Northington now called Avon movedwith his Family to Farmington and Engaged to attend the Farmington Flouring Mill built upon FarmingtonRiver & owned by a company by the name of Cowles Deming & Camp, He took possession of those millsin 1818 & He continued in charge of them nearly all the time up to 1846 I remained with my Fatherattending school in the Town of Farmington untill I was 14 years. The 1st of May 1821 I went to livewith Col George Cowles & remained with him two years attending school during the winter season & workedupon his Farm through the summer. while with him during the year 1822 I passed through another greatrevival of religion among the people I like the rest of my young companions attended enquiring meetings& prayer meetings among the Pryesbeytarians they being the ownly religious society in the town I also attended theirSundy school I laboured & prayed & tried to get religion, but there was sumthing in there manner of teaching& exhorting us to give our hearts to God without telling us what to do or pointing out the way so that we couldunderstand it or comprehend it that with me it created darkness & not light, misery & not happiness & therteachings did not seem to enlighted my mind or do me Good although I laboured hard to obtain benefit from it. many young people were making profession of religion but I did not wish to make a mock of thosethings or profess to be converted & have religion unless I could be made sensible that I had received light& truth & sumthing tangible that would be of benefit to me I did pray & labor hard to obtain religionbut did not feel that I obtained any special light truth or benefit in trying to follow the teachings given me at that time 
 I remained with Mr. Cowles untill June 1823 a little over two years I then returned home & spent the seasonwith my Father & worked in the Mill and in the fall My Father made an arangement with Mr.Andrew Mills of West Hartford Ct for me to board with him & do chores for my board & go to schoolAccording to agreement I soon became a member of Mr. Mills Family & for several weeks I passedthrough a regular course of that distressing deisease called Home sickness I suffered immensly I had neverbefore lived at any place whare I had not been free & social. But Mr Mills was a proud Auste[r]e man& I had no conversation with him ownly in being asked & answering a question & for about 2 weeksI did not eat drink or sleep but little but I soon began to go to school & because acquainted with myschool mates & my sickness left me & has never yet returned and at the close of the school I returnedhome to my Fathers house in the spring of 1824. But soon my Father Made a contract with MrHorace Judd for me to go & work one year with him. He was our nearest neighbor at our homested in Northingtonand one of my school mates his Father having died & left him in charge of a large Family of sistersHe being the ownly son. I commenced work with him but did not stay the year out during the for partof winter I split my instep open with an ax which lamed me for abot nine months My BrotherThompson took my place and worked my time out also one year for himself. I remained athome untill the spring of 1825 when I started from home on horseback to go some 10 miles to engage to workfor a man a year upon a farm but before I arived there my horse run away with me & flung me amongsome Rocks & broke one of my legs twice in two & put out both Ancles in a shocking manner as recorded inthe Chapter of incidents. this confined me to the House near two months. the first time that I walked half amile I went to attend the funeral of two men one by the name of Bird who was murdered by a crazy man named Roe Hesplit open Birds Head with an ax and laid his brains bare & cut his throat from ear to ear, and the other mans namewas Bodwell a promising young man who was shot dedad the night after the murder by one of his companions underthe following circumstances word was given out to take Row either Dead or alive & about 500 men went out intothe Mountains Hills vallies & the whole country was guarded as the Murderer had hid himself up, they went out 3 or 4 incompany and Roe had a plad cloak on & Mr Bodwell put on the same kind of a cloak to go out to guard throughthe night, his uncle strongly urged him not to wear the cloak as it might endanger his life. but He thinking there would be no danger wore it & during the evening while approching another company a young man by thename of Gager seeing a man by the name of Gager with a cloak on he thinking that it might be RoeHe hailed him with the countersign & recieved no answer He then leveled his gun & fired & shot Bodwelldead he spoke a few moments & expired I saw the corpses of these men it was the first body which had benmurdered that I had ever seen. Roe was finally taken & tryed acquitted upon the plea of insanity butput into the insane assylum Gager was tryed for manslaughter, but forfeited & paid his bond rather than run therisk of being found guilty. I remained at home with my Father untill Aprill 1826 at work in the mill I attendedschool during the past winter being 18 years of age. In April 1826 I went to live with widow Deming inthe east part of Northington, I staid with her and labored upon her farm for nine mionths I then returnedhome to my Fathers House and assisted him in his mills. I remained with him untill April 1827 at whichtime I left home & went to live with My Fathers Sister Aunt Hellen Wheeler I took her Flouring Milland tended it upon shares in East Avon I never again returned to my Fathers House to live with him Iownly called as a visitor I was always made welcome at my Fathers House by each member of it this was animportant period in my feelings to leave my Fathers roof to step forth upon the stage of life to act for myselfto be my own councellor & form my own caracter in the open broad world filled my mind with serious reflectionas I wanded my way from my Fathers Roof it created in my mind an anxiety which was more paneful than Joyous 
 I was twenty years of age when I left my Fathers Family & commenced business with aunt Wheeler Iremained with her for three years which brought me to 1830. I had the following reflections on leaving myFathers house. -[should I outlive my Parents how long will it be before I shall follow them to the grave and the placeswhich now know them will know them no more & it will be said of them they have gone the way of all the Earth andtheir children while filling their places are following them into the same Eternal world. I am now twenty years of age & leaving my Fathers house this is an important period & step in my life & in the life of Evry man for at thisage generally speaking evry man forms a character both for time and Eternity. The character principles & sentimentswhich are formed from the age of Eightteen to twenty five are generall so deeply planted in the heart that theycontroll their future lives & remain with them through life whether they be good or evil. and I felt to say howcautious I ought to be how I pass this link in the chain of my existance I felt that I needed caution prudencecircumspection & wisdom to guide my Footsteps as I step forth to act for myself. I reflected upon the days ofmy youth which were gone & the speed of time which had flown like an arrow to return no more forever, whilewalkeing in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither can we spend twice the same timethen how ought we to prize the golden moments of time & measure it out with our talents to the honor& glory of God & for the salvation of our souls so that when the Lord comes he may recieve his ownwith usury. In trying to comprehend the fleetness of time I asked myself the question whare is the old worldwhare are the Prophets & Apostles whare are the millions of the inhabitants of the Earth including my Father& whare are the days of my youth, gone, gone, all gone into the boundless ocean of Eternity whareI shall soon find myself]-During the 3 years which I spent with Aunt Wheeler I passed through quite a school of experiencesboth temporal & spiritual. The class of associates which I made choice of on ariving at my newhome were young men of the first respectibility in the place yet none of us professed to be guidedwholey by religious principles Hence we occasionally mingled in parties of pleasure, the Ball room & inseveral instances I took a hand at a game of cards yet I had many fears about taking this step ormingling with men who would engage in this dangerous vice yet they were all young men who stoodhigh in the estimation of their friends & the world, but the influence of such men whare it is bad is the most to be dreaded of any on Earth. becaus the example of the vulgar & disipated will not havemuch influence over the man who intends to maintain a fair standing in society while at the sametime he might yield to the influence of respectable men in society even to do wrong even to that degree thatbefore he is aware of it that he finds that he has sacraficed his time, talents & property for that whichhas done him no good, but brought upon him sorrow, disgrace, misery, & sore repentance & in many instanceswhen it is to late to redeem himself. But I felt that the hand of the Lord was over me in this thing as well as inevry thing Els for whenever I have yeielded to the enticement of my associats to stake any thing at the card tableI had the good fortune in almost evry instance to loose it. I did not however loose but a small amount inthis way untill I made a strong resolution that I would entirely forsake this vice if no other before I gainedmuch of a taste or desire for it which resolution I have always kept. There was a spirit at work with mein all recreation the card table, ball room, or any party of pleasure that drew my mind away I took no pleasurein those things whatever my anticipations were they all fled when I arived at the spot I seemed to be as a spekled birds in the midst of my associates they all seemed to enjoy themselves except me. I at times wondered why it was so, but I have since learned there was nothing there which fed the immortalmind. Before I commenced doing business for myself I had not acquired much taste for reading withthe intention of obtaining solid information from books neither had I improved my time in school as I ought to have 
 done and I now found that I had several leasure hours each day & I felt satisfyed that it was not my dutyto squander away this leasure time but the question arose in my mind what I should do withit. I did not like novel reading because it was a fiction & did not store the mind with truth or knowledgeas for history I had not acquired a tast for that not having read it. & while reading a school Book Ifound the following true remark "He that will spend his life in that manner which is most excell-ent will find that custom will render it most delightsome." It made a strong impression upon mymind so I immediately commenced to spend my leasure hours the first year in reading history but the greatestdifficulty with me was I read a great deal more than I could digest, remember or profit by I soon found I gaineda taste for reading History I obtained an interest in ^it^ which grew upon me. While perusing History we holdconvers with men of Judgement wisdom & knowledge & by persueing this course we can lay up an extensivefund of valuable information. I commenced by reading the History of the United States; of England, Scotland,Greece, Rome, Rollins Ancient History, Josephus and others which I took much interest in and finally I tookhold of the Bible for History And I never have found as interesting a history as the Bible while reading thatBook we convers as it were with the Lord & with the Prophets & Apostles of God & while studying theword of God we learn thruths which cannot be obtained from any other source & those Books whichcontain the revelations of Heaven are of far more interest than those books containing alone the opinionstheories & doctrins of man.While living with Aunt Wheeler or during the first year of my staywith her I passed through anoth scene of a revival of religion among the Prysbetarians who were the prevailingreligion of that place I listened the teachings of Elder Kellogg the minister of the place & attended themeetings of the people But the teachings & principle were not such as I believed in or such as I believedshould belong to the Church of Christ, & I do not think that I obtained any special benefit duringthis religious Excitement. In the midst of it I was called to follow my Brother Philo to the grave which caused me sorrow for a season He was taken suddenly Ill & after a few days illness a Physican was employed& ordered him strong doses of Calchicum which was poison & he died the 2nd soon after swallowing the seconddose I accidentally herd of his sickness & went home to see him I spent a few moments in conversing withhim he seemed comfortable, I lay down to rest a short time with the intention of setting up with him thelatter part of the night I had not lain long before his Mother said to me Philo was in a fit I arosewalked to his bed side & saw that He was dead I immediately called the Physician who gave him the medicinehe looked at him & turned away much agitated I considered him poisoned to death He diaed Nov 25 1827He had a dream a few month before which troubled his mind much. He dreamed there was a Angelarived from Heaven & was going through the streets with a roll containing a list of the Deaths of the peoplein that Town during that year And the Angel approached him & unrolled his list & told himthat there would be funeral attended at his Fathers House on the 27th of Nov He recorded it in hisJournal & on that vary day he was buried himself.Soon after I was called to set up for the nightwith the corps of a young man by the name of Henry Miller who was vary wicked & profane Hehad been the day before to a celebration of the 4th of July & his Father was a religious man & reprovedhim for his Profanity & wickedness, & while going into the Field to get up some Hay their came up a sudden thunder shower. & Heanry mocked God & the thunder & in a moment he was struct deadstanding near his Father I attended his Father funeral & it made a deep impression upon my mindI remained with Aunt Wheeler during 3 year & 10 days but I lost a good share of my wages by loaning my moneyto an unprincipled young man by the name of Wm Sage & Joining my Brother Azmon in Fitting out Ezra Harton a padling expedition he turned crazy & lost nearly all we sent out by him I left Aunt Wheelers Family 
 On the 10 day of April 1830 with the feelings of Friendship & good will to wards her & her HouseholdUp to this period I have spent my life a little like a ship tosted upon the waves of the sea up & dow^n^ unstable& unsettelled in my mind, at times triying to worship the Lord & living thate life of a christian & then at other timesgiving it up & trying to take pleasure in the the things of the world, but in the midst of it all there seemed tobe an unseen hand guiding my destiny. I had now arived at 23 years of age and I sensibly realized & deeply Felt that my youth had gone to return no more forever to me, and I felt that I had spent a good deal of my time in a manner that was not profitable to me not that I had been guilty of committing any Heinousor outbreaking sins such as Murder, theft, Adultary, Fornications or Blasphamies, yet I hagd a good deal of my youth in vanity & folly giving way at times to many idle words and vain and foolish recreationswhich did not store the mind with knowledge or produce any profitable fruit. At this time I reflecteddeeply upon the past & I became thoroughly convinced that there was no real peace or Enjoyment in anything except in the servitce of God or in those things which the Lord would Approbate. And I came to adetermined firm resolution in my own mind that from this time henceforth & forever I would seekthe Lord with all my heart, I would seek to know his will by faith, Prayer, & the reading of theword of God, and I was determined to follow the dictation of the Holy spirit and do the will of God asfar as I could learn it. I brought before my mind in my meditation all the honor, glory & happiness ofthe whole world as far as I could grasp in my imagination I placed before my mind the gold & wealthof the miser. The glory grandure & power of Monarchs, kings, Princes Presidents & Rulers. The militaryRenown of Allexander Napoleon & other Military Generals. I cast my mind through the innumerable pathsthrough which the giddy world travel in search of pleasure happiness, & Joy, and in suming the whole matterup in the vision of my mind I had to exclaim with Solomon that it was all "vanity of vanities, or all is vanitysaith the preacher" I could see that it would all find one common grave in a few short days and I wasthoroughly convinced that no man could enjoy true happiness & peace & obtain that which would feedthe immortal mind. Except God was his friend, and Jesus Christ his Advocate, & he done their will & kepttheir commands. Upon this ground I felt determined to stand & spend my future life.I made an ingagement with Mr Samuel Collins of Collinsville Cdt (the manufactrurer of the Collinsesaxes) to attend his Flouring Mill I commenced work for Mr Samuel Collins on the 14th day ofMay 1830th. I commenced boarding with a company of about 30 men, mostly young men but theybeing of a vain worldly turn of mind I did not enjoy myself in their company and I change myboarding place took up my residence in a private family by the name of Dudly D. Sacket.About this time a Reformation broke out in Farmington Connecticut mostly conducted bythe Methodist denomination My younger brother Asahel H. Woodruff made a professionof Religion and seemed to be vary much ingaged in the cause which was a great consolationto me I attended there meetings and felt to regoicede to see my brother so much ingaged intrying to serve the Lord & acting up to the best light he had. I had a great Desire to do thewill of God & to know what to do to be saved I prayed night & day as I had an oppertunity& the Lord Blessed me with much of his Holy Spirit and I was happy, all things to me seemedto praise the Lord the soon [sun], Moon & stars, sky, air land and water, Montains Hills rocks & Dales, forestsgroves meadows & grain all things seemed to praise the Lord. it began to me to be the Hapiest period of my life. I had often herd those feelings expressed by individuals but to me it was a blind story untillnow. My Feelings brought plainly to my mind the words of the SlPsalmest David whare he plainly expresses 
 his feelings upon this subject when he called upon the Rocks, woods, Mountains, & hills to Praise the Lord Hecalls upon the waves of the sea to praise their God "He says the Mountains skiped like rams & the LittleHills like lambs. He exclaimed what ailed theeye ye mountains that ye skiped like rams & ye little Hills likelambs.["] [##Psalm 114:4-6##] now my impression is that the mountains did not move but it was the feelings of the Psalmest he was filledwith such a sense of the Love of God & that these theings were the work of his hands & that God was in them &that they were praiseing him, this feelings is enjoyed more or less at times by all who are governed andcontrolled by the Holy spirit. I felt to resolve more and more that I would spend my whole life in the serviceof the Lord. My work was very light in the Mill and I had much leasure time for reading, meditation& prayer and I began to read the bible with a more prayerful attention than ever before in my life andI found it to be a new book to me it contained truths of the most glorious & sublime nature if I wish forHistory I could find it there. If I was cast down or tried or tempted I there found a remidy in con-nextion with the spirit of God. The Lord is the author of the Book and his promises swep away the darknessfrom my mind. The more I prayed & searched the word of God the more I felt my own weekness & dependenceupon the Lord. I felt to pray that the Lord would enlighten my my mind, enlarge my heart & give me wisdom& understanding.The reformation continued in Farmington, and a number of my relativeswere deeply ingaged in the service of the Lord according to the best light they have among whom was uncleOzen Woodruff & his wife Hannah Woodruff unto whom I have been much attached all my life having lived agood deal with them during my early life I attended meetings freequently with them and Enjoyedmyself much in their societyThere was an Island but a short distance from the Mill the center of which was an ^open^ level fieldcovered with wildflowers of various kinds, the Island was surrounded with a rapid current of water, dashingover rock, the banks of which were thickly studied with tall waving pines. I chose this Island day & night as my place of retirement for prayer, praise & meditation before the Lord I spent many a midnighthour alone upon that Island in prayer before the Lord, and the many happy hours in sweet meditationwhich I spent in my lonely walks upon that Plesant retreat I shall never forget in time. The words of Robert Pollock in one of his poems often came to my mind while sitting alone in that solitary placewhere He says "In the wide desert where the view was large, "Plesant were many scenes but most to me,  "The solitude of vast extant, untouched by hand of art, "Whose natured sowed herself, and reaped her crops."Whose garments were the clouds, whose minstrels Brooks,"Whose lamps the Moon & stars, whose organ choir the voice of many waters, "whose banquits the falling deesws, whose heroes storms, "whose warriors mighty winds, whose lovers flowers,"Whose orators the thunderbolts of God,"Whose palaces the Everlasting hills,"Whose ceiling heavens unfathomable blue,"And from whose rocky turrets batteled high,"Prospects immens spread out on all sides in air,"Lost now between the walk in and the main,"Now walked with hills that slept above the stormThe roaring waters, the waving pines, giving room to the passing winds, the field of flowers crusted with the silver rays of the moon, being all open to the eye and ear while the curtain of heaven clo decked with the starsand moon mingling with the survey. These things resting upon my mind as the handy work of God in connextionwith prayer & meditation accompanied by the Holy spirit, gave unto me peculiar charm, sensation Joy & happinesswhich I had never before enjoyed & experienced in my life. The Lord Blessed me with joy happiness & consolationbecaus I was acting up to the best light and knowledge I had, and when a man will do that in any age of the worldI am satisfied the Lord will bless him. I had no Peter, or Apostle, or any man who held the holy Priesthood to lead meor teach me the way to be saved. So I had to do the waybest way I could. I got up prayer meetings in our village & prayed 
 for light and knowledge. I attended a methodist camp meeting in Farmington Ct. with many of my relatives &friends and had an interesting time. I now searched the bibles & prayed earnestly to know what duties I should perform in order to be saved & I called upon the Lord & prayed unto the Lord to guide me in all things bothtemporal & spiritual & the Lord did manifest many things unto me & heard and answered my prayers yet I felt that I needed a teacher & leader in the things of God I had a Desire to attend to the ordinances of the gospel yet I did not feel disposed to Join any religious sect or church that I was acquaintedwith because I could not see the organization with any sect on earth that was manifest in the days of the prophets& Christ and the Apostles. yet I could see that Baptism by immersion was a commandment of God &I had a Desire to be baptized and not understanding any thing about the Priesthood or the Authorityto administer in the ordinances of the Gospel I applyed to a Baptist minister to Baptize me I told himat the same time that I did not wish to Join his church & gave him my reasons that I did not consider theorganization according to the pattern of the Apostolic Church Mr George Phippen was the name of theBaptist Minister at first refused to Baptize me saying that it was against there rules to Baptize any oneexcept he joined there church, but after conversing with him several times upon the subject he saidhe would baptize me. So upon the 5th day of March 1831, on Saturday Mr Phippen Preached a discourse inFarmington upon the subject of Baptism & then went to Farmington River accompanied by a large congregationand Baptized myself & my Brother Asahel and we went our way rejoiceing thinking we had donethe will of God. this is the ownly Gospel ordinance I attempted to attend to untill I joined the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints hands was not laid upon me for the Holy Ghost for it was not practicedbut I had peace of mind because I acted up to the best light I had at the time.I did not remain with Mr Collins quite one year he wished to remove his Mill as he wished the water privilegefor other purposes so I settelled up my business with him & Engaged to tend the Flowuring mill to Mr RichardB. Cowles of New Hartford Ct. when I settled with Mr Collins he gave me a strong invitation to come andlabour for him should I wish a place & proffered to give me any recommends I should ask. I parted withhim and his Clerk John Barlow and with all my acquaintances in that place with the Best of Feelings and I feltthat I was leaving a place whare I had spent many a pleasing & happy hour, after spending a few days invisiting my Friends I went to New Hartford & commenced business for Mr Cowles on the 20 day of March 1831I spent one year with Mr Cowles During my stay there I attended meetings with the various denominations of the place I also heldmeetings with the young people I found several persons with whom my spirit was congenial with my feelings among whomwas two men by the name of Lyman & Buel there feelings & views were in a measure similar to my ownwe visited each other much & prayed together often & spent many a good hour together in prayer & conversingupon the things of God. there were several protracted meetings in the Town while I was there I freequentlyattended & several ministers asked me to Join their churches I would ask them if they had the faith that wasonce delivered to the saints, if they laid hands upon the sick & had dreams Revelations & visions as did the AncientSaints & if they had Prophets and Apostles they would say no these are not needed now they are done away soI could not believe as they did so I did not Join any church but I gave myself constantly to Prayer readingthe Bible, & meditation and I called upon the Lord Earnestly to lead and guide me I spent many hours in thewoods among the Rocks & in the mill at midnight calling upon the Lord to teach me what to do I finally madethe following prayer & petition unto the Lord with a determination to ask untill I obtained an answer "O Lordare the priest & People who profess they name and who appear zealous in thy cause by holding many meetings& call upon they name with a loud voice & who labour hard to make many proseliytes are they they people arethey & their works excepted at thine hand. if so O Lord why am I separated from them in spirit 
 why cannot I feel at home with them & worship with them why am I left alone like a speckled bird of theforest why do they oppose me in those things which the spirit & word of God teach me is true. And againif they are not the people of God and are not excepted of thee why do they prosper why do they gathermany souls unto there churches who appear cincere. And if they are not the people of the Lord whereshall I find they people O Lord show me these things and teach me what to do and I covenant toobey thy voice and do thy will, and after praying earnestly onto the Lord with this prayer on acertain night in my mill untill after midnight the spirit of the Lord rested upon me & the voice ofthe spirit of the Lord said unto me go to my word & I will there show thee my will and answerthy prayer. I opened the Bible promiscously praying the Lord in my heart to direct my mind tothat portion of his word which would answer my prayes & show me the truth and I opened to theLVI Chapter of Isaiah which I read and was satisfied that it was in answer to my prayer. I was satisfiedthe salvation of God was abot to be revealed and his righteousness to come forth I was also satisfied that I shouldlive to see the people of God gathered, and I should be with them and that I should have a name & a placein the House of God with his sons and Daughters, and I felt that I ought not any more to say that I wasutterly seperated from the people of God. I aslso believed that the priests of the day were in great measure likethe shepherds described in that chapter that they were ignorant and did not understand, and that they all lookedfor their gain from there quarter and that they were not satisfied and were like greedy dogs who could neverhave enough. from that hour I was satisfyed to remain as I was untill I should find the people of God which Ilooked for in faith and believed I should know them when I saw them. I had no one to lead or guide me in theway of the Lord except the spirit and word of God, these I tried to cling unto. My mind abut this time wasdeeply exercised upon one principle and that was Keeping the seventh day of the week for the sabbath in[stead]of the first day I found that the seventh day was esstablished by the Lord himself as the sabbath dayand all Israel was commanded to keep it as the sabbath day forever throughout there generation &I could never find where the Lord ever changed the sabbath day. Jesus & the Apostles kept the seventhday of the week as do all the Jews up to the present time and my mind was troubled upon this subjectand I was never satisifyed in my mind upon the subject untill I promised the Lord that I would keep thatday for the sabbath as soon as I was liberated from the gentile yoke so that I could. During the spring of 1832while at Mr Cowles I read a short article in a News Paper stating that there was a New sect rising up thatwere called Mormons that professed to have the ancient gifts of the gospel they healed the sick, cast out devilsspoke in tongues and performed miracles as the Apostles did and that they were going up to Missouri to a placethey called Zion and that they had got a New Book called the Book of Mormon which was revealedto them by an angel of God. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] The Editor of the paper ridiculed the people I heard there was one of the Booksin Barkhampstead 10 miles distant from me I felt very anxious to obtain it to read but I did not get anoppertunity. I said when I saw the article and read it that I did not care what was said about the people if they really had the gifts which the Ancient Saints possessed it was all I would ask, theywere the very people which I was looking for.I settelled up my business with Mr Cowles inan Amicable manner although he wished me to remain with him yet I had made up my mind to go to theWestern Country to purchase a farm. for about 2 weeks previous to leaving him my mind was deeplyexercised upon the subject of going to Rhode Island the spirit that was upon me day and night saidgo to Rhode Island. I called upon my Brother Azmon's to stop with him untill we should start for thewest. as soon as the salutation was past I said to him I wondered what the Lord wanted of me inRhode Island for the spirit of the Lord had rested upon me for 2 weeks & said to me go to Rhode Island 
 In about one ^hour^ after this my Brother Asahel also arived upon a visit and after shaking hands almostthe first words which he spoke was I wonder what the Lord wants of me in Rhode Island for thespirit of the Lord has been upon me for two or three weeks and told me to go to Rhode Island this causedus to marvel as we had not spoken to each other or seen each other for several months I felt convinced itwas our duty to go there yet we could not tell what it meant. But Brother Azmon thought that aswe were about prepareing to go to the west we had Better omit it & I reluctantly consented to it. Subsequently Ilearned that at that vary time Elders Orson Hyde & Samuel H Smith was preaching the gospel in that stateand had we have gone we should certainly have embraced the work & Joined the Latter Day Saintsfor we were prepared in our minds to have received the truth at that time But like Jonah who wassent to Nineveh went to Tarshish so I insted of going to Rhode Island Prepaired myself & went towestern New York. Brother Azmon & myself took each of us a tin trunk with some goods & $800dollars in Monney and started for the west in the spring of 1832 we called upon Father Woodruffat Colebrook Ct whare he had moved a short time previous to attend the flouring Mill of Mr Sagewe spent a day or two at Fathers House then went on our Journey for the west not knowing wharewe should go we finally wandered about through the western part of New York finally went northof Sarycuse into the Town of Richland Oswego County & called upon a man by the name of ConstantSouls & we purchased his Farm of him containing 140 Acres of land a saw mill good Dwelling House Barn& orchard for $1800. We Paid down $800, & the remainder afterwards. I made it my home with MrSouls and Azmon returned to Connecticut for his Family He soon returned & we commenced farming & fencing& lumbering which business we followed together untill the spring of 1834. As soon as I commenced doing businessfor myself I commenced keeping satrurday the seventh day of the week for the sabbath as did my Brother Azmon. we held meetings upon the seventh day and several others in the neighborhood attended themeetings with us and kept the same day of the week for the sabbath I also attended with the variousdonominations that were around us freequently. My Brother Azmon had been a vary peculiar personfrom his childhood up He had been vary strict to his bible, his prayers & to his God. He prayed muchfrom his childhood & had much of the spirit of the Lord & had much light & I was much edifyed & interested with his teaching & conversation He would never employ a physician when sick but alwaystrust in the Lord we were in Richland when the cholera first made its appearance into the United States via carrierinto Sackets Harbor. My Brother Azmon had a severe attack of the cholera in the fall of 1833 I laid handsupon his head with his wife according to his request & prayed for him and Asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to rebuke his desease & command it to Depart from him & the cholera was stayed from the hourand in the morning He was able to walk about & He immediately recovered. this had always been his faithfrom his youth up He had been through some severe fits of sickness but would not empl[o]y any medical aidbut always trusted in God, believing it was his privilege to be healed by the prayer of faith and the laying onof hands as it was in Ancient days this was the state of mind we were both in when the fulness of the gospelreached us by an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. we were looking to find a peoplewho would build up the Chirsturch of Christ according to the Ancient Pattern. Thus I have given a Brief synopsisof my life & experience up to the time of my Embracing the fulness of the gospel & Joining the Latter day Saints whichevent was one of Great Joy to me which laid the foundation of a greater & more glorious work thenever I expected to see in this life & I Pray God in the name of Jesus Christ to guide my future lifethat I may live to his honor & glory & be a benefit to my Fellow man and at last be saved in hisCelestial Kingdom even so Amen 
 CHAPTER IV.My first hearing and embraceing the fulness of the Everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ as taught bythe Latter Day Saints. My Journey to Kirtland Ohio. My first interview with the Prophet JosephOn the 29th day of Dec 1833 Elder Zerah Pulsipher & Brother Cheny called at my House &wished to hold a meeting in the neighborhood I and Brother Azmon were absent from Home My Brotherswife informed them that we would light wish to hear them Accordingly they gave out an appointment forpreaching in the school house that evening when I arived home my sister in law informed me that therewould be a mormon meeting in the school House that evening. I immediately turned out my horses & without waitingto eat my supper started for the school House I prayed all the way in my heart that the Lord would open my understa-nding & give me his spirit and if they were men of God & had the truth I prayed that I might receive it I arived atthe school House in this frame of mind without any prejudice in my heart and when I arived the Housewas crouded full I went alone my Brother Azmon had gone before me I crouded my way through the Assemblyand got upon one of the writing desks whare I could see Brother Pulsipher opened the meeting by Prayer Heknelt down and asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ for what He wanted his manner of prayingstruck me vary forcibly & I felt the spirit of God bear testimony that He was a servant of God He arose & sungthen He preached to the People about one hour & a half & the spirit of God rested upon him He bore a strong testimonyof the truth of the gospel which he preached & of the truth of the Book of Mormon which he said was Deliveredto Joseph Smith by an Angel out of Heaven. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] the spirit of the Lord bore a strong testimony to me that whathe said was true. I believed it when he closed He was followed by Brother Cheney who bore testimonythat what had been said was true Brother Pulsipher then gave liberty to any one in the congregation tomake any remarks either for or against what had been said. And almost instantly I found myselfupon my feet without any intention upon my part of speaking but when I founed myself upon myfeet I felt urged by the spirit to bear testimony to the truth of what I had heard so I exhorted my neighbors& friends to be careful what they done as touching those moen not to oppose them for they were the servantsof God & had preached the pure gospel of Jesus Christ unto us this night & I warn you in the name of the Lord notto oppose them but to search the scriptures diligently to see if those things are so. when I closed my Brother Azmonarose & also bore testimony to the truth of the work & he was followed by several others at the close of themeeting I went to the Brethren and asked them to go home with me they did & we had a good deal of conversationwith them. I took the Book of Mormon & went to reading it & the spirit of God bore testimony to me that theBook was true I believed it we sat up till a late hour. I felt to open my Eyes to see, my Ears to hear, & my heartto understand, & my Doors to entertain the servants of God.30th I arose in the morning reflecting upon the gospelwhich I had heard the day before I felt it my duty to offer myself for Baptism. Brother Azmon also felt thethe same we told Brother Pulsipher that we wished to be baptized He appointed the next to Baptize us duringthe day he called upon Elder Holton a preacher of the Free will Baptist denomination He had a Daughter layvary sick & he wished Brother Pulsipher to lay hands upon her & he promised the Lord that if she was healedhe would go foreward & be baptized. Hands was laid upon her & she was healed. also another young woman I spenta good Deal of the time through the day & night in reading the Book of Mormon & conversing with the Brethren I becamemore & more convinced of the truth of the work. Dec 31st 1833. At 11 oclok A.M. there was quite a congregationof People gathered together at the water and I went forth with My Brother Azmon & the two young women who were 
 healed the day before & we were baptized for the remission of our sins By Brother Zera Pulsipher an Elder in the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the snow was about 3 feet deep a cold day & the water mixed with snow & Iceyet I did not feel cold Brother Pulsipher Appointed a meeting at candle light to attend to our confermationa large assembly came to gether and they brought a good deal of the spirit of opposition with them BrotherPulsipher spoke upon the principle of Latter Day Saints laying on of hands He then laid hands upon sus & con-firmed us as members of the Church there was a good Deal of Darkness in the room untill the congregationdispersed they took away the darkness with them & the Holy Ghost fell upon us & we rejoiced greatly.Jan 1st 1834 Elder Noah Holton had covenanted with the Lord to obey the gospel if his child was Healedwhich was the case, but he had not obeyed, & Brother Azmon called upon him this morning & told him in the name of the Lord that if he did not go forth & obey his covenant with the Lord by being Baptized the Lordwould curse him He recieved the warning & went for the with several others & was Baptized this day2nd Elder Pulsipher called all together to day who had been baptized under his hands and organized us intoa Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints containing 12 members. He ordained my BrotherAzmon Woodruff & Noah Holton to the office of Elders & myself a Teacher & I felt that I could trulyexclaim with the prophet of God that it was better to be a door keeper in the House of God than to dwell in the tents ofwickedness. I felt much of the spirit of God resting upon me & bearing testimony to the truth of the Bookof Mormon The license which I received reads as follows(A Power & Authority given to Wilford Woodruff proving that he is a teacher in the Church of Christ bythe will of God the Father according to his Holy calling & the gift & power of the Holy Ghost agreeable to theRevelations of Jesus Christ signifying that He has been baptized and received into the Church according to the Articles & Covenants of the same and ordained under the Hands of Zerah Pulsipher given at RichlandOswego County N. Y. Jan 2nd 1834 Zerah Pulsipher.) I continued with my Brother in Richlandthrough the months of Jan, Feb & March labouring with the Church we had considerable opposition from thePriest & people yet inasmuch as we were humble the Lord ever Delivered us. I walked 65 miles in companywith Brother Hoton to attend an evening meeting with Brother Pulsipher & a few other saints at Brother NewcomeHouse in Fabeus when we arived we held several meetings & spent several Days with them the spirit of the Lord waswith us & we had a good time & were much edefyed and we returned home rejoiceing. We were soon visited byElder Harry Brown & Priest James Blakesley who held two meetings with us & we were much interested. we werenot visited any more untill about the 1st of April at which time Brother Harry Brown returned accompaniedby Elder Parley P. Pratt the first time I had ever seen him. we appointed a meeting for him he met with ourlittle branch and we had a precious time with him He spoke till near midnight He was upon an importantmisshion He in company with Lyman Wight was under a commandment of the Lord to gather together the servantsof the Lord His young men & warriors to go up & redeem Zion it was the will of the Lord that they should gatherto gether 500 men but not to return less than 100. it was the will of the Lord that the young men & middle aged should goup to Zion all that could be spared I told Brother Parley my circumstances He told me it was duty to try& prepare myself to go up to the Land of Zion and Accordingly I used every exertion to settle my business and arange my affairs aso as to go up to Missouri in the spring I went north to Jefferson County with BrotherPratt & Brown & heard Brother Pratt preach several times which strengthened me much in the gospel ofChrist I returned home in Few days & laboured diligently to settle all my accounts so as to be ready to startfor Kirtland in the spring & on the 10th April 1834 Brother Harry Brown & Warran Ingles called at my houseto accompany me on my Journey they remained with us untill the following day. Then on the 11th day ofApril 1834 after prepareing my Horses & waggon I took the parting hand with My Brother Azmon & his 
 wife & children & the Brethren sisters & neighbors in that place & we commenced our Journey for kirtlandOhio whare all the brethren were to meet who were going to Missouri the time of meeting was the first dayof May so all the Brethren could be together according to the word of the Lord. Many of my Neighbors calledto see me & urged me not to go said that I should get killed I told them I had no fears of being killed andI was I should go for the Lord had commanded it we called upon the Saints at Lyons & spent the first sabbathwith them. And the next sabbath we spent with the Brethren in Genese co. We also called upon BrotherMCWithy & spent the night with him we also called upon Brother Lewis we found Brother John Murdock thereand also Orson Pratt this was the first time I had seen those brethren we spent the sabbath with them &heard them both Preach & on monday continued our Journey for Kirtland accompanied by Brothers Pratt& Murdock. Brother Ingels & myself called upon Brother Strong at Tompson & spent the night withhim. I was much Edifyed with his conversation. He showed a draft of a city which he calledZion which he held in his possession. We arived in the Town of Kirtland on the night of the 25thof April 1834. There for the first time in my life I had an interview with our Beloved BrotherJoseph Smith the Prophet Seer & Revelator whom God has raised up in these last day to esstablishhis Church & kingdom in the Last days & to bring forth Revelation unto the children of man thiswas the most important event of my life as far as my feelings were concerned Although myfirst introductions to him was of that Nature that might have been calculated to have tried the feelings & faithof some men whato had formed in there own mind how a Prophet would look & act for when I first sawhim & his Brother Hiram they were shooting at a mark with a brace of Pistols when they stoped shootingI was introduced to them Brother Joseph shook hands Hartily with me & invited me to go to his house &make his habitation my home while I stayed in Kirtland I gladly excepted the invitation & went homein a few moments he brought into the room a wolf skin & said come Brother Woodruff I want you tohelp me tan this wolf skin as I want to put it on my seat while I go my Journey to the west so I pulledoff my coat rolled up my sleeves & went at it & soon taned it over a chair post. while employed atthis I smiled at the appearance of my first labour with the prophet but during the evening He was conversing aboutthe camps going to Zion. He was filled with the spirit of the Lord He smote upon his breast and said I wouldto God I could unbosom my feelings in the House of my Friends Among his remarks in the evening Hesaid dont be discouraged Brethren about our not having means to go to Zion will the Lord will providemeans & He will put it into the Heart of somebody to send me some money. next day he received a Letterfrom Sister Vose containing $150. when He opened the Letter & took out the money He exclaimed see here didI not tell you last evening that the Lord would send me some money to help us on our Journey here it isI was perfectly satisfyed that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I here became acquainted with Many of the Brethren who were going in the camp of Zion & with the High Priest & Elder & private members ofthe Church who were living in Kirtland among whom was the Smith family Cowdry, Rigdon, Brigham Young& his Fathers Family Orson Hyde Milton Holmes & many others. On the 27 of April being Sunday I attendedmeeting and heard many of the Elders preach & testify among whom was Sidney Rigdon, Orson Hyde, ^&^ OrsonPratt. ^Hyrum Smith Oliver Cowdry & Joseph Smith^ it appeared to me there was more light, knowledge, truth, & good sense made manifest in that meetingrespecting the gospel & kingdom of God than I had ever received from the whole sectarian wourld during ^my^ lifeI rejoiced much in being made acquainted with a Prophet of God & the Saints of God I felt that it wasin fulfillment of the promises of God to me in former days it was what my soul had desired formany years And I had now found the people, Church, & kingdom of God And I was satisfiedAnd I felt to Praise the name of the Lord with evry feeling of my whole soul

The whole country now was in the midstof Great excitement the inhabitants of Jackson County who had previously driven our people out of there county were now swareing vengance upon our heads & trying to stir up the feelings of the peoplein Clay County against us the judgments of God fell suddenly upon some of the leaders of the mobin Jackson County & they were drowned in the Missouri River while crossing in a ferry boat& the buzzards eat the flesh off there bones. A Rumour reached us that the people of Richmondwould not let us pass through there town But in the morning of the 19th we went through vary quietly before the people were up no one attempted to disturb us & we intended to go to ClayCounty that day but the Lord knew best what was for our good & he began to harden our progresssoon one wheel broke down & another run of & one thing followed another to hinder us so thatwe did not travel ownly betwen the 2 forks of the fishing river we camped upon an Elevatedpeace of Ground having traveled ownly about 15 miles. Fishing river at this point was composedof seven small streams & those betwen which we had camped were two of them. As we halted andwere makeing preparation for the night five men armed with guns rode into our camp & told us we see Hell enough before morning and there accompaning oath partook of all the malace of Demands they toldus of the various companies of men forming to come against us to night. 60 from Richmond 70 fromClay 200 from Jackson &c all had sworn to destroy us. the weather was pleasant at this time all wascalm & sereane but as soon as the men left the camp there was a small cloud as big as a manshand seen & it soon began to spread with great rapidity & in a few moments the whole Heavens gatheredblackness & a mightly storm burst with fury upon the Heads of our Enemies the storm tremendiousthe wind Hail & rain & thunder met our Enemies in great wrath & soon softened their direfulcourage and frustrated all their plans to "kill Joe Smith" & his Armey. Instead of fighting theycrawled into waggons & under them & into Hollow trees one company filled an old shanty & heldthe bridles of their Horses betwen the logs of the cabbin till the Horses were so pelted with hail they broke the brid[l]esacross the fingers of their owners & fleed many miles before the storm leaving their riders to suck the Blood 
 off from their peeled fingers while they were swaring that they could not go to fight "Joe Smith but what tharemust be a Hail storm sent or some other Damned damned thin[g] kicked up to stop them["] and after the mob hadhad spent that Dreary night in the midst of the pelting storm, all their amunictian wet many of their Horses gonethey were willing to return home & as soon as Arangements could be made this forlorn hope took the backtract to Jackson County & other places to Joined the main body of mob. "fully satisfyed as were the survivors of those who were drowned that when Jehovah fights they would rather be absent the gratifycation is too terrible"There was but little Hail fell in our camp but the rain fall in torents & the wind blew all our tents down but fortunatelywe were near an old Baptist meeting house wall [we all] went into that & was comfortable Joseph tried to hold up his tent itillthe groungd was covered with water then He let it blow down & went into the ^House with the^ rest of us & remarked as He camein "Boys there is a meaning to the storm the Lord has sent this as a Blessing unto us it is for our defense the stormin camp was but light to what it was around us, for all around for half a mile distant the Hail stones & lumps of Icefell in great abundance cut down the crops of corn cut off li[m]bs from the trees, lightnings flashed incessantly& the roaring of thunder was tremendious. the Earth trembled & quaked it seemed at [as] if the mandates ofvengance had gone forth from the gGod of Battles to protect his servants from the Destruction of their enemiesThe little stream that was not more than Ancle Deep at sundown in the morning was about 40 feet deep &our Enemies swore that the waters rose 30 feet in 30 minuts in Little fishing River. it broke up allthe calculations of the mob about fighting us & they all broke up & went home the best they couldFriday 20th we went 5 miles onto the prairie to procure food for our horses & ourselves & to esstablish ourselves for a shorttime so we could Defend ourselves from the wrath of our enemies, and while in this situation on Saturday the21 Col Sconce with two other Leading men from Richmond Ray County came to see us & wished to knowour intentions. For said He I see there is an Almighty Power that protects this people for I started fromRichmond Ray County with a company of Armed men having a full determination to destroy you but waskept back from you a tremendious storm. When He entered camp He was seized with a great trembling& had to sit down & when he had told the object of his visit Joseph arose & addressed them & toldthem our sufferings in Jackson County & other places in consequence of our religion & that we had come1000 miles to bring clothing & other assistance to our persecuted Brethren and after making a lengthy speechthey were melted down & offered him their hands & said they would use their influence to allay the excitement& would do us what good they could, they wept while Hearing the recital of our persecutions & found that ourintentions wer good, according to there agreement they rode all around among the people & allayed the excitement so that we couldgo whare we pleased unmolested. June 22nd Cornelius Gillom the sheriff of Clay County called upon us & wanted to seeJoseph Smith He steped forth & said I am the man the first time He had made himself known to his enemies since Heleft Kirtland. He expressed his views concerning us & gave some instruction concerning the manners customs & dispositions ofthe people. The Prophet Joseph received a revelation to day on Fishing River Missouri June 22 concerning our campexcepting our offerings as He did Abrahambs &c it is published in the Church History concerning the Redemption of Zion.About this time Brothers Thayer & Hayes were attacked with the cholera & Brother Hancock was taken during the stormJoseph Had previously called the camp to gether & told them that in consequence of Disobedience they of some who were not willing to listen to his words & carry out his council & had rebelled & said that God had decreed that sickness shouldcome upon them & they would die like sheep with the rot & warned the camp that they would be visited by sickness& Judgment he was sorry for it but could not help it.On the 23rd we started for Liberty Clay Countytaking a circuitous course round the Heads of fishing river to avoid the deep water when within 5 or 6 miles of Libertywe were met by Gen Atchinson & others who desired us not to go to Liberty as the feelings of the people were so muchagainst us. we then wheeled to the left & crossing the prairie & woodland we came to Sidney Gilberts Residents & 
 and Encamped on the Bank of Rush Creek in Brother Burghates Burgharts field Brother Burghart offered me smallroom for me & my company if we would clean it out so we went at it & cleaned it out & spread down ourBlankets we had but Just got it fiixed when the Brethren were attacked with the cholera in camp & they were broughin & laid side & sid & it was but a short time untill their was near a Dozen laid open our beds as theprophet had Declaired so it came to pass men fell in camp as though they were struck downby the Destroying Angel and during the night some of the guard fell to the ground with their gun in handat the commencement Brother Joseph laid hands upon those who were seized with it cholera but He quicklylearned by experienced that when the great Jehovah Decreed a Destruction upon any people & made that known manmust not attemp to stay his hand for as soon as he laid hands upon the sick & rebuked the desease it instantlyseized him & came near slaying him. Early in the morning of the 25 the camp was seperated into smallbands & all that had teams was councelled to take them away And as I had a team I made preparationsto leave all were councilled to leave the ground except enough to take care of the sick As Brother SethHitchcock of my company had the cholera we have him his choice of any men in our company tosatay to take care of him He made choice of Warran Ingels Harry Browns Brother in Law Hetook his gun & things out of my waggon & went into the room & hung them up & wept becausehe had to stop he felt as though he himself would die which afterwards proved to be the case. I rem[ov]edmy waggon to Brother Lyman Wights with Milton Holmes & Heman Hyde & made it our homewith him we went However to Brother Lowerys House first & spent the first few days with him from there toLyman Wights. But while I was there a number of the Brethren among whom was Brigham Young Heber C.Kimball Orson Pratt Luke Johnson G. A. Smith & others were in the camp of the sick, attending to the sick &Burying the dead. see Heber C Kimballs Journal & Church History which gives an Account of the same"The cholera continued its Ravages about 4 days about 68 of the saints suffered from this disease duringwhich time the following persons died 13 in number John S. Carter, Eber Wilcox, (Seth Hitchcock (from mycompany) Erastus Rudd, Algernon Sidney Gilbert, Alfred Frisk, Edward Ives, Noah JohnsonJesse B Lawson, Robert McCord, Elial Strong, Jesse Smith & Betsey Parrish. When the cholera firstattacked the Brethren John S. Carter was the first man to stretch out his hand to rebuke it & he was instantlyseized with it & the first man that Died about 6 oclok in the afternoon in about 30 minuts after Seth Hitchcockdied. it was impossible to obtain coffins but the Brethren roolled them up in our Blankets which we had spreaddown & drew them half a mile & buried them on in the Bank of a small stream which empties into rush creekthe dead was drawn upon an ox stead, while some were diging the graves others stood & guardedwith gun in hand to keep off the Enemy. almost evry man in camp was afflicted with a camp distemperor diarrhea except myself I was not troubled with it allt all not that I considered myself any better than my Brethrenwho had died many of the Brethren were sick night unto death with it among whom were Orson Pratt J. B. NoblesZ Coulton, G. A. Smith & many others but they practized bathing & baptizing in cold water which they thought was very Benefitial to them Brother Ingles was attacked with the cholera & died and wasamong the Last that were buried. I went down one night to take care of him but he had a watcher so I tookcare of Zebedee Coultrin during the night as he had no one with him Brother Joseph was also afflictedwith it for several days. Brother Ingels had been my companion all the way from my home inRichland while on the Journey after Brother Joseph got better He called the Saints together at BrLyman Wights & told them the cholera had been sent according to his prediction & nearly all hadsuffered more or less & some 15 had died & he said to the Saints if you will now humble yourselvesbefore the Lord & covenant to keep his commandments from this time forth I promise you in the name 
 of the Lord that the plague shall be staid from this hour & there shall not be another case of itand the Brethren covenaneted with uplifted to hands to keep the commands of God & to obeythe council of the prophet & the plage was stayed from that hour there was not another caseof it among the saints. Brother Lyman Wight had taken a Job of work of Col Arthur to makehim 100000 Brick & to build him a House. I commenced work for Brother Wight about thefirst of July we first went into Col Arthurs wheat field to help cut his wheat. I found it a great privi-lege to live with Brother Wight at this time as all the High Priest & High Councils meetings were held inhis house and nearly all the Councils of the Church in Zion were held at his house this gave me a chance to obtaingreat light knowledge & instruction which I highly prized. The Prophet Joseph met with all the Authorities othe Church in that Land & organized the Church in Zion He appointed a presidency of three & a High Councilof twelve men He met with us several times. He met the Authorities at Lyman Wights on the 7th of July where brother Joseph gave us a great deal of teaching & council while he was clothed upon with muchof the spirit & power of God He taught with regard to the office of the priesthood & administering therein He ordainedDavid Whitmer President & W. W. Phelps & John Whitmer assistance. He also ordained Twelve CouncellorsFather Whitmore came forward & blessed his three sons David, John & Christian Whitmore in the name of theLord Also Father Knight Blessed his son Newel. All present voted with uplifted hands to Heaven to sustainBrother Joseph & allso the Authorities in Zion who had been appiointed & set apart for this purpose to preside overthe Church & Kingdom of God this was the last meeting I ever attended with Joseph Smith in the State of Mo.I counted it one of the greatest Blessings of my life to have the privileg of travelling in Zions Camp with himone thousand miles & of hearing his teachings & instruction it was a feast to my soul. He left for Kirtlandwith his Brother Hyrum & others on the 9th July. Brother Joseph Advised according to the word of the Lord inthe revelation given that all who could stop in Missouri & not go back should do so. I gave in my nameto tarry so I spent the summer with Brother Wight & worked in company with Milton Holmes Heman Hyde & others. Brother Joseph returned to me the sword which I had given him & he had carried it allthe way upon his Journey from Kirtland to Missouri so I felt to keep it & preserve it as a relic ofthat campaign.I attended ^meetings^ through the summer we occasionally had preaching from the Elders whowere appointed to teach & evry sabbath we had meetings at Brother Wights & broke bread & exhortedeach other to faithfulness. I also occasionally met with the Teachers Quorum which office I still heldand I enjoyed the meetings well. While at Brother Lyman Wight I wrote a vary lengthy letter to Father RobertMason of symnbury Ct. who was called the Prophet Mason & who had taught me from my youth up the gifts &graces of the gospel. I gave him an account of the rise & progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saintsthe Administration of the Angel the coming forth of the Book of Mormon the order of the Priesthood &c [##Joseph Smith-History 1:30-59##] He received theLetter Heard it read with Joy several times (He handled the Letter as he did the fruit in the vision.) but he was neara hundred years old. He soon died & did not live to see an Elder to administer unto him the ordinances of the gospel Ihave spoken upon this same subject in my 2nd Chapter.The following is a list of the names & Priniple places & distances which I past through going From Richland N.

 Believing it to be the Duty of the Latter Day Saints to consecrate and Dedicate all there properties with themselves untoGod in order to become Lawful Heirs to the Celestial Kingdom of God, it was under such a view of the subject & in obedience to the cammandments of God that I consecrated what I had (though but little) before Bishop EdwardPartridge who was the Presiding Bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in Clay County Mo. Dec 31 1834The following is a copy of the consecration.Clay County Missouri Dec 31st 1834.

Total $240.00I received a Letter from my Brother Azmon Woodruff the Latter Part of Nov 1834which gave me much sorrow. He was my Eldest Brother and a vary religious man from hischildhood up, and he laboured hard to know the will of God and to do it. He believed in theancient order of the Church, and he rejoiced when the fulness of the gospel came unto us andwas baptized under the hands of Zerah Pulsipher at the same time that I was and when I left Igave him a power of Attorney to sell my Property at the same time that he did his so that He couldcome on to Zion. The following is an extract of his letter which shows that he had Apostitizedand left the Church His letter was Dated Richland Oswago County N Y. Aug 9th 1834."Brother Wilford I wish to call your Attention a few moments while we take a glance at what iscalled Mormonism. you well know that my mind was tryed on the subject before you left us inthe spring. I have since you left endeavored to look at the subject with an impartial Eye andweigh it in an ^even^ balance and try it by Gods word and spirit, even the word spoken by the Ancient Apostlesand Prophets and by Christ himself and if any man speak not according to this word Judge yewhether in such a case it is right to receive or not." "Joseph Smith says by Revelation that thereshall be 500 ^or less^ of the Lords warriors or valiant menyoung men and middle Aged raised who should go up toRedeem and Defend Zion, and you are not ignorant Brother of their taken carnal weapons such asfire Arms spears dirks swords &c &c. Jesus Christ sayes put up thy sword into its sheath all they that taketh the sword shall perish with the sword [##Matthew 26:52##]. Further more Jesus sayes if thine Enemy hunger feed him if he thirstgive him drink [##Romans 12:20##]. Again love ye your Enemies bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate youand pray for them that despitefully use ^you^ and persecute you [##Matthew 5:44##], and all this for what, the answer is that ye maybe like your Father in heaven. Again Jesus says unto you that ye resist not evil if the a man smite youon the one cheek, offer the other also [##Matthew 5:39##]. He did not say after you have been smitten once, thrice or twice take thesword and fight and slay your enemies, but the contrary, he taught both by precept and example. Andperhaps you may ask shall we suffer our Enemies to destroy us. shall we suffer ourselves to be trodden downas the mire of the streets and make no resistance. In answer I would say If we take Jesus for anEnsample sure it is that we should not fight and resist evil. for when was our great Ensampleever known to retaliate or resist, or revenge or take vengance. No this He never done but sufferedhimself to be lead as a sheep to the slaughter and like a Lamb before his shearers &c" [##Isaiah 53:7##] Now Brotherhow near a like is the procedings of the Mormons and example and precepts of Christ I will tell you" 
 as much alike as light and darkness. And there is as much agreement between in the proceedings of the morm-ons and their preceps & examples of Christ as there is between Christ and Balial and no more. If I am able toJudge in this respect. If they persecute you in this city flee ye into another [##Matthew 10:23##] does this look like disputeingthe ground with the point of the sword at the peril of our lives. there is much in the Testimony if my limits wouldadmit that I would like to call your attention unto but cannot at this time" "There is one thing morehowever that I cannot forbear to mention and that is division in families or rather breaking up of familiesas to the revelations upon this point I am not so well informed, but have understood from the Brethren from different setctions that it was the duty of heads of families or say the Husband or man as he is the head if he is abeliever it is his duty to forsake ^pursuade^ his wife to go with him up to Zion if in his power but if she will not be pursuadedto go with him, then it is his duty to gather up his substance and go up to Zion and leave his wife & family behindNow I would ask what is there in the Old or New Testiament that will support a man in such a course as this theApostle says if the unbelieveing depart let him depart but there is no liberty given to the believer to leave one of hisfamily what God hath joined together let no man put assunder. [##Mark 10:9##] Now for instance were I to leave my family & takewith me my substance (if I had any) and go up to Zion should I not according to the testimony (not of Mormonism) but ofEternal truth be under censure," "should I not be one that refused to provide for his own, even those of his own houseif so then I should be the man that had denyied the faith &c." "I have been taking a view of the revelations ofJoseph Smith and I am persuaded that they not ownly contradict theChrist and the Apostles but they contradict themselvesAnd I must receive Smiths Revelations and reject Christs or Receive Christs & the Apostles & reject Smith's AsI cannot be vary particular here I will ownly ask you to look at one or two. What does the Revelations say concerningthe Lords warriors the Revelations says as I understood P. P. Pratt That inasmuch as 500 of the Lords warriors & valiant young men &c raised &c & if 500 could not be had 400, 300, 200 or 100 but not to return less than 100 [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:32-34##] AndI understood the Revelation to say that with them I would redeem Zion and if I understood your letter there was over200 went up in the camp to redeem Zion armed with various weapons of war. Now the Revelation says thatZion cannot be redeemed because the strength of the Lords House has not come up" Again you say that the Lordsays by revelation that He is well pleased with those who have come up even as he was pleased with AbrahamAnd we know that God was so well pleased with Abraham that He swore to him with an oath. Yet we areinformed that the Lord sent the destroying Angel into your camp to purge & clense it. Now Brother if you cannotsee any impropriety and contradiction in those Revelations as well as others, then I ientreat you to stop for a moment and consider and look again, also the Revelation concerning their stay at Kirtland at first itwas to be but 5 years, now there is to be a Temple built there, and it is to be one of the stake of Zion not tobe removed &c." "I intreat my Brother for Heavens sake & for your own souls sake & Body sake to look atthose things & compare them with themselves & with others of the Revelations And also try them by gGods word& spirit & see if the spirit of truth which cannot lie, you the spirit of inspiration of the Almighty movingupon Joseph Smith caused them to be uttered and written for our learning and profit. And whereas two cannotwalk together except they be agreed. and as I understand that God is love & he that dwelleth in God dwelleth in love &God dwelleth in him [##1 John 4:16##] and that love works no ill to his neighbor [##Romans 13:10##], the fruits of the spirit are peace, joy, longsufferinggentleness &c [##Galatians 5:22##]. I do confess that I never so learned Christ as to learn war or a disposition to return an injuryto mine Enemy but on the contrary Gods word & spirit teaches to keep co^a^les of fire on the Heads of our Enemiesby rendering good for Evil and Blessing for cursing"—** "I would inform you that in the fore part of July I requ[es]tedof the Church of Latter Day Saints in Richland to strike off my name from the Church Record as I could no longerwalk with them I freely delivered up all power and Authority that I was invested with by writing Church Articles&c but as they refused to drop my name I was necessiated to fling in a withdrawing letter and cut myself off fromthe connextion. the particulars I cannot now mention." "Dear Brother if I had room I would like to tell you 
 how much of the fulness & Blessings of the gospel of Christ these dear Brethren & sisters of the MormonChurch in Richland possess. Once their was nobody like Brother Woodruff now he is so bad. If it wasin their power I think they would sift me as wheat. I am glad for one thing and that is my soull,nor my body my time nor my Eternity is not at their disposal, if it was I should greatly fear what would become of me. If they are a fair sample of mormonism god Lord Deliver me fromit." "I think it likely you will see me published in the star. I though[t] I would be to quickfor them but do not know but I shall see how far they will go in doing by others as theywould wish others to do by them. I do not doubt but that many sincere honest souls havegone into the work, such I think will come forth when they see they are going counterto the testimony of Jesus Christ. You may perhaps think me to severe. But I cansay if I know my own heart that I desire to know the truth yes that truth that makethfree [##John 8:32-33##] and that brings not into bondage to any man. I think that I realize in some degree thatfire shall try evry mans work of what sort it is [##1 Corinthians 3:13##]. O may the good Lord help us so to build that when theburning days shall come our works shall a bide the fire and come forth as the most fine gold which maythe Lord grant for his sons sake. Yours in the flesh and I trust in the Lord. Azmon Woodruff^The following was written to me in connexion with the foregoing letter. By my Brother Thompson Woodruff^The following is the Answer which I sent to my Brother Azmon Woodruff in reply to the foregoing LetterDear Brother Wilford. I write to inform you that I have arived at home in Richland and found to mydisappointment that you had gone * * Your Father and we all feel vary bad to think you have gone after sucheronius Erronious principles. we think you must be vary much deceived. Why not stay whare you was and worshipyour God under the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth and with liberty. And you must know that it is agreat disappointment to your friends to have you go and leave them. It is my wish to have you leave mormonism and come back, but you can do as you please. But whether we meet in time or not is vary uncertainbut I hope the Lord will forgive us all at last. Your Affectionate Brother Thompson WoodruffThe following is the Answer which I sent to my Brethren Azmon & Thomson Woodruff in reply to the foregoing LettersLiberty Clay County Missouri Nov 29th 1834To all my Kinsfolks in Richland. I received your letterunder date of Aug 9th But have not attempted to Answer it untill the present time. But being sensible thattime is short with many of this generation, I feel desireous to address you by letter as I think it vary uncertainwhether I ever ^shall^ behold your faces again untill I f meet you at the bar of the gGreat Jehovah. I would inform you that my health is good and at present I possess a contented mind. It rejoices my soul that the Lordhath speared my life to the present time and supported me through so many dangers seen and unseenboth temporally and spiritually and embraced me within the new and Everlasting covenant and given me theprivilege of Enjoying the society of those servants of God who are determined to follow Christ through evil aswell as good report. Brethren; it was a satisfaction to me to hear from you, yet some of the contents ofyour letters gcaused me pain and that too for your sakes. And in answering your letter I must answer my ^own^mind and clear my soul of your Blood, that your Blood be not required at my hands at the bar of God.And could I have the privilege I would rather clear my mind by conversing face to face than by writingbut as I am wholey deprived of that privilege I feel it my duty to do it by writing and also to answer someof your questions. Brethren in answering your letter I have no desire to injure your feelings yet I mustbe plain and answer my mind and what I say to you I shall say with a realizeing sens that I shall oneday be called to give an account for this act to that God who has made me & redeemed my soul.Brother Thompson let me answer you by saying that the cause of my leaving Richland when and 
 as I did was not to injure you or out of any ill will towards you but I did this act with a settelled beliefthat it was my duty. And I am more and more convinced that I did my duty in so doing. I acknowledgeyour question to be vary civil in asking me whiy I "could not stay whare I was and worship God underthe true light of the gospel in spirit and in truth and with Liberty." In answering this question I wouldsay that you have the sentiments of my heart when I say that I verily believe that Lot would havebeen as safe to have remained in Sodom after being warned to flee out by the Angel of God as I shouldhave been to have remained in Richland, calculating to make it my abiding place with the light I hadbefore me. No I could not remain there and worship God under the true light of the gospel in spirit and in truthbecause the voice to me is, come out of her ye my people that ye partake not of her sins that ye receive not of herplagues [##Revelation 18:4##]. Brother Thompson you may be assured that God hath not finished his work on the Earth &his wsword is hathed in heaven and will soon fall upon Idumea or the world [##Isaiah 34:5##] yea I believe thatmost awful events await this generation yea I believe God is about to exhort his power to overthrow Babylonand to shake both Earth and heaven. yea I believe that sword pestilence and famine await this generationof the human family who do not repent and turn unto God and stand in Holy places. Brother ThompsonI feel deeply interested in your welfare and salvation both Temporally and spiritually both for time & Eternity therefore let me this once perhaps for the last time waren you to prepare to meet your gGod andalso this once not to despise & reject the revelations of Jesus Christ for he will soon come to judge every manfor the deeds done in the body. Brother Thompson what more can I say to you, it is a day of warning& not of many words [##Doctrine and Covenants 63:58##], the day is not far distant when you will know of a truth whether the causein which I am Engaged is of God or from a source of Darkness and Error. Yea I verily believe thehour is nigh at the door that will report in the Ears of those who remain in Babylon far more heart rending scenes respecting the things which await them & will overtake them than you are permitted to receive from my pen.Although I should incur the displeasure of many of my fellow men or even my relatives by the grace ofGod assisting me I shall not scease to exhort my influence or to lift my voice to warn this generation to preparethemselves to be accounted worthy to escape the Just Judgements of God that awaits this generation. I do notexpect to remain stationary long in Clay County But I expect to travel south during the winter how muchlonger I do not know * * Brother Thompson I now bid you farewell and I desire that while the kingdomsof this world are overturning that you may receive and obey the celestial Law of God that you may abidea celestial Glory And that God will Enlighten your understanding to that degree that you may so improvethe blessings which are within your reach in the last days so as to find a seat in the Celestial Kingdom of God withAbram Isaac and Jacob is the prayer of your Absent Brother Wilford WoodruffBrother Azmon I not ownly feel it a privilege but my duty to address you this again by writing andanswer some of your questions given to me in your communication. I am sensible we cannot givea fair representation of things by writing as by word of mouth. We are more liable to form wrongconceptions of things by letter (even where the intention is good) than by word of mouth. The questionswhich you have asked in your letter appear very clear to me and could I see you I think I could eexplain them to your satisfaction but it is a thing almost impossible to do it upon one sheet of paperyet I feel it my duty to say a few words respeting some of them as it respects carnal weapons beingused by the saints of God in the last days there is much said up on the subject by the Ancient ProphetsThe Plough shares are to be beat into swords & the pruneing hooks into spears, Let th[e] weak say I am strong [##Joel 3:10##]Yea, one is to chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight [##Deuteronomy 32:30##] this is to take place in Gods own timein the last days. It is to be said to Zion, (according to the Prophet Isaiah) that her horn should be made 
 "Iron and her hoofs Brass and she should beat, in peaces many people &c" [##Micah 4:13##] As it respects the remark I madeabout the Lord's being pleased with those who came up in th[e] camp of Zion or they being compared withAbram, it was their offering which he was pleased with. that is to say they were willing to lay down thare lives for Christs sake and the sake of their Brethren. Yet He was not pleased with any murmuringsor complainings that might be in the camp but rather they were chastized for it, some mens sins goto judgment beforehand while others follow after. Again as it respects Kirtland being a stake of Zionthere never has been any revelation given to infringe upon Kirtland's being a stake of Zion or bearing any import why it should not become a stake & evry word of the Lord be fulfilled.Because the Lord said He would not hold any guilty who should go up to Zion with an openheart, after the space of 5 years, which time the Lord willeth to retain a strong hold in the Land of ZionKirtland [##Doctrine and Covenants 64:21-22##]. This saying does not prove that Kirtland will not be a stake of Zion for a longer period than 5 years but it goes to show that the Lord wished many of his servants to remain inKirtland that length of time for a special purpose. Neither does it prove because the Lordhas commanded his people to build unto his name a Temple or a city that it will not eventuallybe thrown down. Again you say that if the brethren or sisters in Richland are a fair sampleof Mormonism you wish to be delivered from it. I wish to ask you if you consider such meansa fair way to investigate the subject, if they as members of the Church of Christ have done wrongdoes this prove that the whole body is corrupted or that it is not a true church. Because there wasa Judas with Christ and the Apostles, does that prove that they were fals teachers or Christ afals Prophet certainly not. Brother Azmon I think it is for the want of intelligence & information that causes you to discover such gross Errors and contradictions (as in your view)there is in the Revelations given in there last days. for my part I cannot discover anycontradictions in themselves or that contradicts the teachings, precepts, & revelations of JesusChrist our Savior. But rather I behold them beaming with gospel light, truth intelligence and gloryBrother Azmon I was not a little surprised to learn from your letter that you had denyed andrejected the Revelations of Jesus Christ for I know them to be such which you have rejected. Isay I was not a little surprised to learn this fact after your having received as great a degree oflight as you have in your day and generation. Let me this one call your mind to review the past withreflection, and at the same time permit me to ask you some questions. I wish you to call to mind the days andyears of your youth. while standing as it were alone to maintain and contend for that faith once deliveredto the Saints. Also the many times you have stood and proclaimed in the ears of this generations thosethings which awaited them if they rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ. Again have you not long beenlooking for the Church of Christ to arise out of the wilderness of darkness and Error yea when youheard the sound of the gospel proclaimed did you not gladly receive it with your whole soul and wentforth and was baptized the first sermon that you herd an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday saints deliver unto the people. I now wish to ask you, By what spirit was you actuated and moved uponwhen you bore witness unto your fellow men and testifyed unto them that the spirit of God bore witness toyou of the truth of the Book of Mormon and by what spirit was you governed when you wentto Brother Holton in the name of the Lord and told him if He rejected the work which the Latter DaySaints brought unto us that his days would be short and what light he had would be taken from himAnd also when you told Wm Hubbard that you knew that He would be condemned if He rejected itAnd also when you declaired that you was Delivered both soul and body by the laying on off hands of 
 Elder Zerah Pulsipher in the name of the Lord. I believe that you was actuated and moved upon by the spirit ofGod yea I believe that you was honest and sincere in those things. And if this was the case let me nowask by what spirit are you governed and controlled when you turn around and deny and reject thesethings it certainly is not of God. And now Brother Azmon considering exhisting circumstanceswith you I cannot forbear unreservedly telling you what I Believe concerning you and your coursewhen I have behel the light and Glory that the Celestial Law and kingdom of God is presenting to us in theselast days it has been a source of Great Enjoyment to me in the reflection that the day was near whenI should Join with you in the kingdom of God in partaking of those Celestial Immortal and Eternalglories But Alas how am I disappointed Brother Azmon unless you repent like Peter and humbleyourself before God I do not ever expect to meet you there. [##Matthew 26:75##] Dear Sir you have but a faintidea of the immortal Joys & glories that you have in a voluntary manner deprived yourselfthe privilege of ever enjoying. I intreat you in Christ stead to stop while to stop is in yourpower and consider the awful calamity and destruction you are bringing upon your own soul.I mean by denying the Lord that bought you, and put him to an open shame. perhaps you mayconsider this a light thing But those revelations which you have denyed are the Revelation of JesusChrist And you will soon find it a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God. I had notreceived your letter when I sent you the Book of Commandments and if you have received themand consider them of No worth unto you, You will do me a favor by giving them to Brother Fiskor to someone in the church of the Latter Day Saints. But above all things I warn you to beware abouttreating those things with disdain or making ridiclule of them for of a truth if you do they willrise in Judgment against you. you now profess to believe those revelations to be of man & not of Godbut should they at last prove to be of God it would be better for you that they had not fallen into your handsinasmuch as you treat lightly the things which they contain. But there is no doubt upon my mind uponthis subject And I again warn you in the name of Jesus Christ that you no more tread lightly thoseRevelations and Commandments for in so doing you treat with disdain the council of the Almightyand set at naught the Revelations of Jesus Christ and if you continue to do those things they will serveto pearce your soul Yea if you continue such a course and do not repent you will have cause todrink with carefulness & Eat your bread with trembling for your days of prosperity will be fewBrother Azmon the day is nigh even at your own door when you will know of a truth that thesesayings are not fables but Eternal truths. the time is at hand when the heavens will be rolled together asa scroll and Jesus Christ will be revealed in the clouds of Heaven with his saints to take vengance onthose who know not God and obey not the Gospel And He will reward evry man according to the deedsdone in the body.Brother Azmon I have dealt thus plain with you that I may be clear of yourBlood and be found acquitted at the bar of God. I think it doubtful whether I meet you short ofthe Eternal world. But I commend you into the hands of Almighty God who doeth all thingswright. I leave these remarks in your hands to deal with as you see fit. But remember we areAccountable to God for all the deeds done in the Body That the Lord will be merciful unto you and deliveryou from Darkness And Error, give you light and truth & so direct your remaining days as to cause you torepent and humble yourself before God that you may again Embrace the fulness of the Everlasting Gospel & theNew and everlasting covenant that you may escape the Just Judgments of God is the earnest Prayer of you[r]Absent Brother.I would say to all my friends that I desire your welfare and your salvation AndI intreat you all not to treat lightly or abuse any sacred things or principles which you have in 
 your possession or within your reach for the day is at hand that will try many souls. As it respectsmyself I can say the cause I am ingaged in I will never renounce for friend or foe. No by thegrace of God Assisting me I am determined that neither the powers of Earth or Hell wicked menor devils shall ever separate me from the New and Everlasting Covenant which God hathmade in these last days with his Saints. I to highly prize and value the Blessings embracedin this covenant to part with such glorious treasures for any shineing straws that arefloating down lifes stream. There is virtues in this covenant that will give a man Joywhen this Earth shakes like chaos and will fill him with Joy and felicity and glory at thesight of his Lord and Master in the clouds of heaven Yea their souls will be inspiredwith the recollection that they have fought the good fight, that they have finished theircourse and are now prepared to receive there crowns [##2 Timothy 4:7-8##]. Yea I essteem the reproach ofChrist greater riches than the treasures of the Earth [##Hebrews 11:26##] and I am determin to spendmy days in the cause even if Father, Mother, Brothers, Sister, and all my kindred opposeme for in some degree I know the value of the cause in which I am Engage And if God befor me who can be against me? [##Romans 8:31##] As Ever I remain your Brother Wilford Woodruff.CHAPTER VI.My ordination to the Aaronic Priesthood My first mission to Preach the gospelMy travels through Missouri, Arkansas, and Tennessee Incidents of My JourneyHaving embraced the fulness of the Everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ and seeing init great beauty, power, Glory, and salvation I had a great desire to teach it to my fellowmen and this desire increased upon me and rested with great wait upon my mind, butI did not reveal this to any man. But one sunday evening I retired into the woods aloneby myself and called upon the Lord in mighty Prayer to open my way to go & Preach thegospel of salvation to the children of men, the spirit of the Lord rested upon me and borewitness unto me that my Prayer was heard & should be answered upon my head I arosefrom ^my^ knees happy and walked some 40 rods through a thick wood into an open roadas I entered the road there stood before me Judge Elias Higby an High Priest with whomI had associated daily but he had never passed a word with me about Preaching to my recollectionbut now as I approached him He said "Brother Wilford the spirit of the Lord tells me thatyou should be ordained and go & preach the gospel.["] I said vary well if it is the will of the LordI am ready. It was a Practice at this time in Zion if anyone was to be ordained to be recom-mended by the branc[h] where they lived And at a meeting of the High Council Held atLyman Wights, Clay County, Missouri, On the 5th day of Nov 1834 Brother LymanWight called a vote of the Branch of the Church to recommend Stephen Winchester, HemanT Hyde & Wilford Woodruff to the High Council for ordination the vote was unanimous Thenthe High Council voted to ordain us the office of Priest. Brother Simeon Carter was appointed toto ordain us we were Accordingly ordained under his his hand to the office of a Priest on this5 day of Nov 1834.I Received the following license. To whom these presents may comeThis certifies that Wilford Woodruff has been received into this Church of Latter Day Saints organizedon the 6th day of April AD 1830 and has been ordained a Priest according to the rules & regulations 
 of said Church and is duly authorized to preach the gospel and act in all the ordinances of the House of theLord agreeable to the Authority of the office.Given by the direction of a council of Elders assembled inClay County Missouri Nov 5th 1834John WhitmerI called upon Bishop Edward Partridge and asked him whare my mission should be in what part of the countryI should go to preach the gospel. He replyed that He would like to have some of the Brethren go into the Southern Statesthrough Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, &c if he could find any body who had faith Enough to go for it wouldbe a hard mission & a hard mission country to travel in at present in consequence of the Missouri persecutionI told him I was as ready to go South as any whare Els if he wished it. As Arkansas lay south of Mo Iasked him if I should go through Jackson County as that county lay direct in our path. He said it would bea risk of ones life but if I had faith to undertake it I might do it He had not. I asked him if I wentthrough Jackson County should I start without "Purs or scrip" He said he had not faith enough to attemptit through Jackson County if I had I might try it. As the commandments required the Elders to travelwithout purse or scrip I felt strenuous to keep the commandments so I resolved to go without purse or scripI wished to have some companion to go with me upon my mission as I did not wish to launch forth into the open worldalone I called upon Brother Henry Brown (who had gone accompanied me from Richland N. Y. to M.o.)I laid before him my intended mission and requested him to acompany me, it met his wishes and he agreedto go with me and we immediately commenced preparing for our Journey which we were soon prepared andon the 13th day of January 1835 I received the following RecommendLiberty, Clay County, Missouri, Jan 13th 1835. This certifies that Wilford Woodruff has faithfully dischargedevry duty required of him in the Camp of the Saints in Journeying from Kirtland Ohio to this place, has beenvery faithful in the discharge of his duty since his arival here both spiritual & temporal, is strong in thefaith of the Latter Day Saints and worthy of his calling he is recommended by the Church in this placeto any branch whare Providence may call himLyman WightAfter receiving the above recommend I bid Brother Wight & family goodby and shouldered my volieseweighing 15 lbs, mostly Books of Mormon, and started in company with Elder Henry Brown upon my firstmission upon this 13th day of Jan 1835. we started without purse or scrip. I also took with me a petitionto the Governor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done us biy the inhabitants of Jackson County in drivingus from our homes iand lands in Jackson County Missouri. this was a bold move as we were about topass through Jackson County & should we be caught by the mob & the petition found with us it mightcost us our lives. But I felt to lift up my heart in prayer to God to preserve us from the hand of ourenemies and to Grant us wisdom & make us meet for our Masters use and assist us to rightly dividethe word of truth & give evry man their portion of meat in due season that our garments mightbe clear of the Blood of all men. We crossed the Missouri River in a ferry bout & landed in JacksonCounty as we steped upon the bank two horsemen went into the boat they Eyed us vary close but saidnothing to us. this was the first time that my feet had ever troad the soil of Jackson County Missouriand I felt to thank God for the privilege we bowed down upon our knees before God & offered up ourpetitions & thanksgivings unto God while at the same time that Land was polluted by wicked and ungodly men. we travelled 23 miles & spent the night with one Brother Benson who still remained inthat county & we got 5 signers to the ^petition to the^ Governor of Missouri for wrongs done us by the JacksonCounty Mob. 14th Travelle[d] but 5 miles & spent the night with Brother Charles McClure & got himto sign the petition. 15th Travelled 12 miles through some of the most beautiful rolling prairie I

He said there was but one straitghtroad & that forked but once said the right hand fork was the one for us to take, the spirit saidto me he was deceiving us I asked him the question tree times over And he affirmedeach time that he was telling us the truth, we took his direction and it led us into the OsageRiver swamp and we were lost in the darkness of the night. we undertook to follow theriver but it being about the crookedest one on Earth & we wallowing in mud & water wemade but slow progress we finally struck out into the open prairie concluding to liedown till day light. But the Osage Indians were having a pa wa at the traiding postand by the sound of their drums, hoops, yiels, & shouts, we were guided into their midstnear midnight vary weary & covered with mud, about a dozen large savage Indgiandogs surrounded us before we got into camp came & smelt of us in a friendly mannerbut did not either bite or bark. We were vary kindly received & entertained by MrJerew through the night He had an Osage Squaw for a wife. she got us a goodsupper but marvelled that we did not drink coffee. she offered us their bestbed which we did not except off as we were as were covered with mud, she then madeus a good bed before a large fire whare we slept till Morning. May the Lord rewardboth Mr. Jerruw & wife also the Priesbyterian Minister both according to their deserts19th This morning Mr Jarrew furnished us with a good breakfast sent an Indian to set us acrossthe Osage River, and we started upon our long days Journey it being 60 miles to the nearest House inthe direction in which we were travelling & we had not one mouthful of any kind of food with usmy feet were quite lame in the morning being galled by my boots while travelling in the mud & water the night before we travelled in a South East direction we crossed a long level prairiewe travelled in but little timber through the day. we came into timber about dark a large blackboar [bear] came out of the timber & met us on the prairie we had no weapons of any kind when Heapproached within a few rods of us he arose upon his hind feet and examined us closely then leftus & went away in another course. we travelled vary hard & fast all day as we wished to getto a house, at about 9 oclok at night we were travelling in the woods it was exceding dark we hadgreat difficulty in keeping the road, we were surrounded by a hungry drove of woolves what numberwe could not tell, but their seemed to be many of them, they would rush upon us & come withina few feet of us & then fall back and kept up a continual Howling we travelled in the midstof them in ^this^ way for about one hour untill we felt that it was dangerous to travel in such companywe concluded to build a fire & wait untill morning Having fireworks with us we struck up agreat fire of large oak limbs & the wolves retreated to the distance. as we were about to lie down 
 for the night to await the light of day, we heard the barking of a dog and soon the Jingling of a cowbell we tookeach of us a fire brand in our hand and we soon arived at a House occupied by a Mr Williams who wasin Jackson County during the mobings of the Saints.

I opened the door and saw the room was filled with large serpents I shudderedat the sight & tried to avoid going through the room but I could not do it so I steped into the room to gothrough trusting my life in the hands of God, and as I got near the center of the floor all the snakesarose in a curve with their heads several feet from the floor & sprung at me as though they woulddevour me in an instant there was one much larger then the rest & he struck at my face Just beforehe reached me he droped dead & evry one drop dead in the room, they burst open, took fire, & were consumed& I passed through the room unharmed I then awoke, in the morning I told Brother Brown my dream& told him that we were going to meet with opposition but we should conquer & it was nigh us8th [FIGURE] Our expectations were high this morning of meeting with Latter Day Saints as we werenow in the Neighborhood of the Akeman family who were in the persecution in Jackson CountyFather Akeman had a family of sons grown up large tall men they were all in the persecutionhis wife died strong in the faith in Jackson County. his Name was Allexander Akemansome of his sons were severely whiped in Jackson among whom was Willis Akeman. the oldGentleman was surrounded with his sons who had settelled around him he was living alone withone Daughter. This 8th day of Feb was sunday we arose in the morning took breakfast & walked5 miles to Mr Akemans House, went into his house expecting to meet a friend we passed complements 
 Febuary 8th 1835with him but he received us vary coldly & we soon found that he had Apostitized & wasbitter against the Church He found much fault with the Leading men of the Church & said the Book ofMormon came from the Devil, and he told us the people in the Neighborhood would be opposed to mormonismI soon began to see that here was the field for my dream to be fulfilled in. I asked Mr Akemans if thare was not some in that Neighborhood who were in the faith of the gospel he said his son Wright Akemanprofessed to be in the faith he lived near by with another of his sons we might see him he directed uswhere he lived we went down to see him. We found him a little like a drowning man neither dead or alivewe got him into the woods prayed and talked with him for hours and at last he appeared to have a litterle lifewe took up our abode with him for a short time9th As it began to be noised abroad that there was two mormon preachers in the place it created quite a stirup & down Petty John Creek which was thickly settelled for 20 or 30 miles, the people began to cry outagainst us & said they ^would^ mob us and ride us upon rails & c Brother Brown was for leaving but I told himI felt resolved to stay & see my dream out. Soon the people began to be taken sick & die as though thecholera ^was^ upon every hand we spent the day at Mr Akemans10th We Travelled around the Neighborhood some 6 miles Assisted Mr Willis Akeman in some business11th There was an Aged man living near by named Johnathan Hubbel He had read the Book of Mormonand Believed it. He called upon us and invited us to make his house our home while we tarried inthe place we went home with him & spent the night12th We spent the day at Mr Hubbels in writing13th I wrote a Letter to the Brethren in Zion. we were now hearing of Deaths all most daily aroundus. I had been impressed several times to go up & visit Mr Allexander Akeman who had apostitized& bear my testimony to him of the truth of Mormonism but whenever I did it I met the powers ofdarkness and opposition so great that my mouth was closed & I had no freedom of speech andthe last time I visited him the opposition to me was so great that I resolved I would never calledupon him again, unless I was commanded of the Lord to do so. the opposition was increasing aroundus yet we had given out some Appointments for preaching14th day of Feb 1835 This was an important day to me. In company with Brother Brown I took my axand went into the woods to help Brother Hubbel clear some land. we continued choping untill 3 oclockin the Afternoon, the spirit of the Lord came upon me like a rushing mighty wind & the voice of the spiritsaid to me go up again & visit Mr Akeman again bear testimony unto him of the truth of theBook of Mormon & the work of God. I marvelled at this I told Brother Brown what the spiritsaid to me. He said I might go if I wished but He should not. I carried my Ax to the House& walked up to Mr Akemans about 1 1/2 miles through a plesant grove meditating upon this strangeoperation of the spirit onto me & was in a deep gloomy frame of mind and thought as I approachedthe House I saw the door open and Mr Akeman walking the floor I felt particularlyimpressed to ask if he was well He said he never felt better in health. I told him I hadcome to again bear testimony unto him of the truth of the Book of Mormon & the work of God andthe danger of opposing that work. He soon was filled with wrath & indignation and He opp[os]edme in the storongest tearms and raged against the leaders of the Church, my mouth was more closedup than before I felt that the house was filled with devils & awful darkness I felt Horreaibly 
 Febuary 14th 1835^[FIGURE]^ I did not understand why the Lord should send me into the midst of such spirits to bear testimonyof his work I felt vary strangely my tongue was glued to my mouth I could not speak Iarose to my feet to leave the House. I felt as though the floor moved under my feet & when Istoped upon the ground I felt that I was surrounded with devils and I felt like fleeing as Lotdid when He went out of Sodom, without looking behind me. [##Genesis 19:17##] Mr Akeman followed meout of the door close to my heels about 8 rods without either of us speaking I knew he wasfollowing close to me when about 8 rods from the House this strange feeling left me inthe twinkling of an Eye and when Mr Akeman got to the place where this feeling leftme he fell dead at my feet as though he had been struck with a thunderbolt from HeavenI herd him fall to the Earth, but I was so agitated I did not look behind me at allhis daughter stood in the door way saw him fall she fainted & fell at the same time & neitherof them spoke a word that I could hear, I continued to walk down to Mr Hubbels asfast as I could meditating upon the strange dealings of God with me still not knowingthat Mr Akeman was dead. I arived at Mr Hubbels Just at dark in a peculiarstate of Mind. supper was ready we all sat down to the table blessing was asked I tookup my knife & fork to commence eating and I herd a horse coming upon a full runI droped my knife & fork & listened, a man rode up to our door and cryed out MrAkeman is dead I want you to go there immediately. In a moment my eyes were open to under-stand the whole subject I felt satisfied with the dealings of God with me in calling me to go & warn himas soon as his daughter came to her senses she ran to her nearest brothers & gave the alarm we walked up tothe house as soon as we could when we arived there we found all of his sons in the house around his bodywailing in an awful manner. he was naturally a large man but when we come to see his dead body it was swollen to a great extent it appeared as though his skin was ready to crack open & he wasas black as an Affrican. We immediately went to work & made a large box and put him into itI continued to think of my dream15th Sunday we had an Appointed a meeting at Mr Hubbels for Preaching to day but in consequence of the deathof Mr Akeman but few came together I spent the day there conversing upon the gospel16 [FIGURE] We attended the funeral & assisted in burying the body of Mr Akeman I preached the gospel tothe people at the close I got 10 signers to the petition to the Govornor of Missouri. we also continued tohear of Deaths around us almost daily17 We travelled from Mr Akemans to Mr Elijah Bakers Preached at his house according to appointmentfrom thence to Josiah Harts who invited us to spend the night with him & we did so he was 74 75years of Age18th Travelled to Wm Wit's 5 miles got 5 signers to the petition and A patriot in the Revolution He signed the petition19 Walked to Mr Hubbels and Preached according to an appointment at his house we got 6 signers toour petition. we then walked 4 miles to Benjamin Snellin's20th We walked in the morning to Brother Wright Akemans & spent the day labouring with our handsIn the evening we walked 3 miles to Mr IHubbels & spent the evening in Preaching the wordof the Lord to his household.

 February 22nd 183522 Sunday we Preached to Mr Hubbel's to a full House at the close of the meeting BrotherBrown Baptized Mr Hubbel & his wife23rd Brother Brown was now vary anxious to continue his Journey down the Arkansas River to Little Rockcross the Missippi bottom and go into the State of Tennessee. This is an Error which many Elders fallinto as soon as they get doors open for preaching & the people were ready to receive it they will run away& leave them this was the case with us. We had been there 13 days had met with much opposition inthe begining but the Lord had sent Judgment upon our opposers & there had been more than 20 death in theneighborhood during our stay with the people, and our worst opposer had droped dead at my feet, my dreamhad its pe[r]fect fulfillment, prejudice had given way, & the people were Just ready to Embrace the gospel &pleading with us to stay and preach to them, which had we have done we certainly should have built up a church in that place. I wished to stop & labour with the people as the Lord had opened doors for us, But BrBrown would not consent. He was Holding the office of an Elder, I a Priest, And I felt that I mustbe subject to any one over me in office so I had to yield much to the grief of the people & in oppositionto my own Judgment.

 March 24th 1835 he therefore thought we had Better separate as he wished to travel faster than I could in mylame situation. I did not object to the proposition though I thought I should not be willing to leavea ^lame^ companion in the ministry in an open swamp without knowing whether he would ever beable to walk far enough to again ever meet withe any company more acceptable than the wolves, bears,and alegators with which Ie was surrounded. However we parted to meet no more for several yearshe left me sitting upon a log in the mud and water without any food and 12 miles to the nearestHouse upon my road. He I gazed upon him as he hastened out of my sight I then knelt downin the water and prayed the Lord in Faith and asked him in the name of Jesus Christto heal me up and open my way so that I could continue my Journey, and the Lord heardmy Prayer and the spirit of God descended upon me and I was healed and I arose and wentmy way rejoiceing.

Sir I am a servant of God a preacher of the gospel and without purse or scrip will youEntertain me for the night and trust to God for your Pay.J. How do I know sir but what you are an imposture, you dont look much like a preacherwhat Denomination are you of.W. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, it is true that youdo not know but that I am an imposter. (And no doubt but he believed it) I can showyou my licens and recommends to Preach the gospelJ. How do I know but what you forged themW. It is true you do not know, but if you are not willing to take my word for it nor willingto keep me for the night I will go my way and try Els whareJ. No sir you cannot go, give me your valise I will keep you over night and get youa congregation and you must preach to us in order to prove to us whether you area preacher or not.By this time I was satisfied that Mr Jackson believed me an impostorI was alone yet I will confess that I did feel somewhat mischieveious I appeared as though 
 March 27th 1835I was frightened and did not wished to be put to the test of preaching in order to prove mea preacher this was the view of Mr Jackson untill he became highly Excited and was in forhaving some fun. I was pleased to see it take this turn for I desired to preach to the people they set a table and gave me a good supper in a large hall. Mr Jackson went out intothe city immediately and gave Notice to a certain class of men and women to come to his hallto hear an imposture preach, and before I got through eating the room began to be croudedwith a class of men and women who were dressed in their silks, satins, and Broad cloth and assoon as I finished my supper the table wdeparted over the heads of the people and Mr Jacksongave me a chair in the cornor of the room placed a stand before me with a Bible & HymnBook upon it about a dozen men formed a half circle in front of me and I saw bythe countenances of the people that they expected some sport. I commenced my meetingby reading a Hymn I asked the assembly to sing but no one sung I then knelt downand prayed the men in front of me all droped upon their knees. When I arose I readand read the ##Romans 11|11 chapter of Romans## and preached from the ##Romans 11:21|21 vers## "For if God spared not thenatural Branches take heed lest he also spareed not thee." I spent but few moments in talkingabout the Jews But I turned to the assembly before me and as the spirit of God rested uponme and revealed unto me the wickedness of their hearts I poured it out upon them andtold them of their wickedness whoredoms and abominations in vary plain termsI do not suppose they ever had their sins as plainly pointed out to them as on thisoccasion the men who sat in front of me droped their heads in the early part of mydiscourse and I could not cketch their Eye afterwards, when I had thooroughly answeredmy mind and had spoaken about an hour and a half I closed my meeting and nota word was spoken by any person the room was instantly cleared and in two minutesI was left alone. The Land Lady came in and and let me to my bed. I had not beenin bed but a few moments untill a croud of the men who had attended collected in the roomJoining me and dicused the subject of my being an impostor and my sermon and they decidedthat I was not an impostor and it puzzled them much to understand how I should know somuch about their crimes being a stranger to them for I had told them much which they wereguilty off. They discussed this subject till near midnight when some Negroes came and brokeopen their turkey roost and they all put out after the Negroes and this enabled me to go tosleep. I arose in the morning and took breakfast. I then called upon Mr Jackson whowas in his store and I thanked him for his kindness and Entertainedment for the nightHe said I was entirely welcome and if I ever came that way to called upon him andI should be welcome to any thing his house afforded. I went my way and walkedMarch 28th 32 miles and was kindly entertained for the night and over Sunday by Mr29 John A Logwood who is what is termed an Infidel by the Christian world I attendeda Presbytarian meeting in the forenoon the sermon was about 10 minutes long but devoid of sense,meaning, light or knowledge this was in Fayett County I got 2 signers to my petition.30th I walked 35 miles and spendt the night with sq[ui]r[e] Hardamand in Hardamand County Iwas vary weary and went to bed early he had 2 sons returned home from colledge they hada Ball and danced till 2 oclok in the morning so I did not get but little sleep

Parley P Pratt's prophecyAs I began the year 1839 by labouring with my handsfor a season to support my family I suspended my Journalfor several months.I will notice however several items noted at thetime: I wrote to my father-in-law my two brothers sister Euniceand brother Smoot; and received one ^letter^ from my father-in-lawand one from my step-mother. My birthday I celebrated inchoping and spliting rails. and Finally I attendedConference in SpringfieldThis conference of the Church in this district was heldin Springfield in the brick meeting house occupied by the CampbellitesIts commenced on Friday March the 8th. I attended it andfrom this date another stage of my history began.I became strongly impressed by the Spirit aboutthis time to go to Quincy Adams County Illinois to visit thebody of the Church which had fled to that place to find anasylum for a season from the perilous persecutions which theyhad been receiving from the inhabitants of the State of MissouriI accordingly set out for Quincy which is one hundred andtwenty miles from Springfiled. I was accompanied by mywife, child and brother and Sister Stephens. This was March 13th.The 16th was a most interesting day. ReachingMr. Cleaveland's we once more had the happiness of greeting 
 three persons one of whom was a preacher.On the following day still indisposed in healthI walked to Froom's Hill wrote a letter to ^my brother^ Aphek Woodruff andspent the night with Elder Brigham Young at brother Benbow'sand the next day I occupied in writing to several of my friends inAmerica. There was a meeting that night at Froom's Hill whenElder Young preached and we ordained Thomas Clark to the officeof Priest.I walked with Elder Brigham Young to ^Dymock^next day the 30th and had an interview with Elder Richards andKington with whom we spent the night. I received three lettersone from ^Mother^ Woodruff one from G. A. Smith and the otherfrom H Cordon.My travels and labours continued and on the5th of May I preached at Crowcutt and baptized 5 persons andconfirmed them one of whom was a preacher and on the 6th Ibaptized and confirmed them and afterwards preached atDun's Close and walked to Taperdin where I baptized andconfirmed 4 making on this day one of whom was a preacherThe next day I walked to Malvern Hilland preached at Colwall and on the following visited the Saintsand friends at Malvern HillIn my walk to Colwall on the 9th, I hada grand survey of Nature send the Power of the Creator whilestanding upon the top of Malvern Hill elevated from 1200 to1500 feet above the level. The surrounding country was beforemy views stretched out many miles. Worcester City lies on theNorth and is clearly seen in the prospect and Gloster on the Southwith several large villages between laid stretch out before mewith Ledbury and other villages in the West and a fine beautifulcultivated vale upon every handWhile standing upon the eminance of thisnoted Hill beholding the grand and charming prospect before methe thunders began to roll and the lightenings flash beneathmy feet in the vale below on which the rain descended intorrents. The solemnity and granduer of the scene wasimpressive as I stood on the Hill above the clouds surveyingthe beautiful works of the Creator and his majesty in the storm. 
 sister Emma Smith who had taken up her abode for a seasonwith her children at the house of sister CleavelandSister Smith had passed through a scene ofsevere affliction since I last saw her and even at this timeJoseph her husband was in prison with other of the Saints^We^ I took dinner with sister Emma and afterwardswe rode to Quincy a distance of 4 milesHere an interesting scene was met. I first calledat the house occupied by Father and Mother Smith theparents of Joseph and also by his brothers Samuel and Carlosand their families.The street was the next scene and hereI met on every hand the Saints with whom I had beenformerly acquainted. There were Petty, Alexander, Smoot,and their families from the South; and there were BrighamYoung, John Taylor, J. P. Green and most all the otherKirtland Saints. Soon brother Jonathan Hale camealong with a shovel on his back and gave me a "Howdo you do brother Woodruff?"I saw so many old friends that I hardlyknew who to go home with first. Finally I concludedto go home and spend the night with Brother JonathanWe had an interesting time together in talking over our travels upon the Islands of the sea. He also gaveme an account of the sufferings of himself and family andof the sufferings of the Saints in Missouri during thepast winter.The inhabitants of Missouri had becometransformed into a State mob with Governor Bogg attheir head. They came from time to time upon theSaints in battle array. Our people were shot down bythem like wild beast others were butchered in cold bloodand some had their brains knocked out after they were takenprisoners. The soldiers also shot down the cattle cowsand hogs of the Saints for the mere purpose of destroyingthem.At times the Saints stood in their own defenceand some of their enemies fell before them. In consequenceof this the Governor of Missouri issued orders for the 
 Sunday the 22nd, we preached at Mr Hubbal's to a full house andat the close of the meeting brother Brown baptized him and his wife.Elder Brown was now very anxious to continue his journeydown the Arkansas River to Littlerock cross the Mississippibottom and go into the State of Tennessee. This was an errorwhich many Elders have fallen into. As soon as doors havebeen opened to them for the preaching of the Gospel andthe people have been ready to receive it they have removedand left them. This was the case with us. We hadbeen there thirteen days and had met with much opposi-tion in the beginning; but the Lord had sent judge-ments upon our opposers; during our stay there hadbeen more than twenty deaths in the neighborhood;our worst enemy had falled dead at my feet; mydream had received its perfect fulfilment; prejudicehad given way and the people were ready to receive theGospel. Indeed they pleaded with us to stay, which hadwe done we certainly should have built up a branch ofthe Church in that place. I desired to tarry and labourwith this people as the Lord had opened doors for us; butbrother Brown would not consent and as he was anElder and I but a Priest I yielded much to the griefof the people and in opposition to my own judgment.Thus was it that on the twenty third we left brotherHubbal's acompanied by brother Wright Akeman andtravelled twenty three miles across the Arkansas Riverfor the purpose of making a canoe to continue ourjourney. This night we spent with Mr John Morse.On the twenty-fourth we cut off twelve feet ofa Cottonwood tree which we also cut down for the purpose of making our canoe. The tree was four feet in diameter.This day was spent in diging out our canoe which wefinished on the next and then launched it put on a good pair of oars and tied it to a tree.We recrossed the river on the twenty-sixth andreturned to Brother Hubbal's to keep an appointment.Here we spent the following day in laboring with ourhands. We did not eat the bread of idleness but spentour leasure time in laboring whenever we were. ThisI considered right. 
 Sunday April 10th I met a company atColwall at Jonothan Lucy's at 9 o'clock in the morningand baptized seven two of whom were preachers. Iconfirmed 12 and then preached at brother Lucy's dinedat Mr Holmes then walked over the top and acrossMalvern Hill and preached at the Pale Horse thence backagain and preached at Benjamin Holland's on the Northside and from there to colwall where I stayed for the nightI extract from my Journal April 11thA VisitOn The Herfordshire BeaconSouth of Malvern Hill.Having my mind prepared for a lonely walkand meditation by reading Parley P. Pratt's Book uponthe "Eternal Duration of matter I commenced ascending theisfamed hill upon the south side and after ascending severalhundred feet I came to the top of an ancient entrenchmentabout a mile in length reaching around all this partof the Hill and meeting. Having ascended about onehundred feet farther I entered another entrenchment likethe one below and after that another; and thus entrenchmentafter entrenchment above each other until I reachedthe top of the Hill which was nearly a flat or level surfaceof circular shape and not more than from one to twoacres in size. Thus I stood upon this Beacon of Hertfordsire more than a thousand feet in height surveyingthe surrounding county from which I could fairly gazeupon the tiers of entrenchments below me thrown up forwar nearly [blank space] in the times of the Romansbeing their military defences and capable of holding hundredsof thousands of fighting men. These hills are altogether bareof timber but covered with grass which is grazed bysheep and asses. Several acres on the S. W. side iscovered with rabbit burrows from which you could see 
 total extermination of Saints from the State.To carry out these vile and inhuman measures he senta General after his own heart to execute his orders forthwith andthis was the cause of our people leaving the State of Missouri andcoming to Quincy.The whole city of the Saints F Far West had to surrender to the militia and the Presidency with about sixtyothers were cast into prison and chains. They were all deliveredat the time of which I write excepting eleven persons.The mob used every exertion to take the life ofJoseph and others; but through the mercy of God in whose handstheir lives were their enemies did not succeed in this.David W. Patten one of the Twelve Apostlesof the Church of Latter-day Saints was one of the martyrs ofthe persecution in Missouri in the winter of 1838. David was one of the first Twelve chosen to bear the Keys of theLatter-day Kingdom. He died strong in the faith thathe had boldy declared for the last seven years.Sunday the 17th I held a council inthe morning with Elders Brigham Young and John Taylorof the Twelve. We then met with the Church in QuincyBrigham took the lead of the meeting.There was a letter read from the committeein Far West praying the brethren in Quincy to send teamsand money for the removing of fifty families from FarWest to this place. There was a contribution taken upfor this purpose of about 50 dollars and a number of teamsto go to the releif of the Saints in Far West.The next day I spent in visiting the Saintsin Quincy. I called upon the family of brother Lyman Wightwho was still in prison with Joseph Hyrum and others inLiberty Clay Co. Missouri. I here obtained my trunk whichhad been in the hands of sister Wight for several yearsOn this day I also visited a number of families who had camped on the bank of the river. Theywere in a suffering condition in cold rain and mud and some suffered for the want of food as well.On the 20th I returned to Rochester and onthe 17th of the next month—April, I settled my family in 
 Feb 28th closed the week and the month an on this day wepreached at brother Hubbal's houseMarch 1st was my birthday and it being Sunday I preachedto a large congregation in the house as before. This was the lasttime that we preached to the people in that settlement. Theywere much grieved at our leaving them an departedfrom the meeting with tears in their eyes. On this day Iwas twenty-eight years of ageOn the 2nd we took the parting hand of brother andsister Hubbal and all our friends upon petty-John CreekAccompanied by brother Wright Akeman we travelled tothe Dardanell's crossed the river and was kindly receivedby Mr John Morse. This day I obtained seven namesto my pettition and travelled 23 miles.Next day a Frenchman by the name of Sangrainmade us an offer to take us down the river in a flat-bottom boat and to pay us wages if we would stay a fewdays. This offer we accepted and spent the interval tothe 7th in chopping and splitting black walnut trailsSunday 8th, I preached at the house of Mr Morse. On this day brother Brown and I went to the top of an highbluff at the Dardenells and engraved our names on the rockThis is the high station which the Osage Indians chose tolook for their enemies in time of war. It is severalhundred feet perpendicular from the base and it is saidthat the Indians formerly flung their prisoners downthe precipiece where they were dashed to pieces. We threwrocks down in experiment and found that by the greatforce of their fall they broke off large trees in the valleybeneath.We continued to labour for Mr Sangrain and sawsome dangerous reptiles while here such as the tarantulaand [blank] wich are very numerous in Arkansas;but on the eleventh in consequence of low watter MrSangrain informed us that he had abandoned allidea of going down the river and that we must lookto our own recourses again. So we concluded toproceed on our journey in our canoe. Embarking wesailed twenty-four miles down the river to Petty-JohnMountain w[h]ere we stoped for the night with a Mr 
 scores of rabbits running about the ground. But I soon with- drew my thougths from the agile little creature that sported uponthe hills to the solemner reflections of the past called up by theentrenchments of battlefields around which told of bloody conflictsbetween the natives and their invaders when England was youngOffering up a prayer upon the summit of the Hill to Him whowill redeem the earth from the curse of sin and prepare it forthe abode of the Saints of the Most High I returned to the Valereflecting upon the rise progress decline and fall of the nationsand empires of the earth and of the revolutions which muststill transpire before the winding up scene and the comingof Christ to reignAt candle light I preached at BrotherJohn Allard's at Wind Point and was endowed with theSpirit of God. I baptized and confirmed four.12th A member of the Wesleanyan Methodistcame to me to enquire what she should Do to be saved. Ianswered in the words of Jesus that she must be born ofwater and the spirit. She received my testimony andwished me to baptize her. I also called upon a womanwho kept the Toll Gate at Chancy's Pitch and preachedthe word unto her. She received it gladly and desiredbaptism at my hands. I then called upon MrsSarah Stanton the house keeper of the splendid mansionbearing the name of Brand Lodge. This lady was aWesleyan but she received my testimony and I administeredthe ordinance of baptism to the three ladies refered toabove. I baptized them in a pond on the enclosedgrounds of Brand Lodge. I also confirmed them and thenwalked to Keysandend's Street and held a meeting with the Saintsexperienced a good time and confirmed 19 persons.It seemed as though some would worshipme while they cried out—"Here is a man of Zion— theMan of God that we have so long looked for. Who is worthy to receive him into their house." I told themto worship God for I was only his servant. I baptizedthree and in all confirmed 22 on this the 12th day of May. 
 Quincy and prepared myself to accompany the Twelve to fulfill therevelation and commandment of the Lord which required us totake our leave of the Saints at Far West on the 26 day of April1839 for the nations of the earth.Previous to the narative of our journey to FarWest to fulfil the revelation and receive our ordinationto the quorum of the Twelve I will relateOne of my Chapters of Accidentswhich occured in the above interval on the 3rd of April[18 lines blank]In company of three of the Twelve ApostlesI left Quincy April the 18th for the purpose of going to FarWest. Brother George A. Smith and Father Cutler wasalso with us and George A. like myself was going upto receive our ordination into the quorum of the Twelve Brigham, Orson Pratt and John Taylor were the threewhom we accompanied.On the fourth day of our journey passingthrough Huntsville we crossed a 9 miles Prairie and foundthe roads crowded with the Saints who were fleeing from 
 Barnet, Pope countyOn the 12th, we rowed our canoe 50 miles and spent thenight at a place called Caldron. There were a number ofgood houses built; but all were deserted, the place, it wassaid being haunted. There was not a human beingbut ourselves within miles of the place. Entering ahouse that must have cost from three to four thousand dollarssupposed to be the worst haunted of the lot we built a goodfire, & rosted a piece of pork to eat with some corn dogergiven us by a poor woman in the moring. We askeda blessing eat our supper and then climbed into oneof the chambers as the stairs were broken down. It wasa cold night but we laid upon the floor with nothing tocover us. I soon fell asleep without any regard to the ghostsand dreamt that I called at my father's house and thatmy stepmother made me up a good feather bed at myfather's house in Farmington. I thought that I laid downupon it, had a good sleep and rested well. I did not awakeuntil sunrise when instead of finding myself upon a featherbed in my parent home I was quite cold and chilly lyingon my back against a bare desolate haunted chamber wallon the bank of the Arkansas River. Awaking brother Brownwe arose not having been disturbed either by ghosts or evilspirits. We then prayed built a fire warmed ourselves,eat what little we had left and then started down theriver after first going to the top of the high bluff andtaking a survay. We travelled 40 miles this day and spentthe night with Mr Samuel Blackburn Palaski County.The next day we travelled to Little Rock, spent threequarters of an hour in visiting the city then continueddown the river ten miles and was kindly received by aMr Isaac Jones at whose house we spent the night.We had travelled this day fifty-three miles.We spent the 15th with Mr Jones and preached the gospelto him and his household; and on the following day leavingour canoe with him we travelled ten miles up the river untilwe reached the old military road leading from Memphis,Tennessee to Little Rock, Arkansass. We took this road andtravelled eastwards though the road was through the Missis-sippe swamp and was mostly covered with water through which 
 On the 13th I baptized one and then walked toLedbury where I received two letters one from Elder Turleyand the other from Parly P. Pratt, after which I walked toStandly Hill and had an interview with Priest Cheese andBarnes. Brother Cheese had baptized 15 since I lastsaw him: also Priest John Parry had baptized 3 onMay the 3rd. (In his letter Elder Turley informed methat he should be liberated from prison on the morrow)Afterwards I walked to Froom's Hill and baptized 3 andmet the Church in company of Elder Brigham Young. Wehad a good meeting and broke bread with the Saints. Wealso at this tieme ordained John Cheese to the office of ElderWilliam Parsons and Joseph Pullen to the office of Priestand Thomas Jinkins to that of Teacher. Besides thesewe confirmed 9 souls and Elder Cheese baptized 2 and ThomasClark baptized 2 moreThe day following I walked to Ledburywith Brigham Young and from thence to Keysend Streetwhere I preached but amid much disturbance and as themeeting was about breaking up the congregation was pelted withrotten eggsOn the 15th I walked to Dymock andspent the day with Elders Young Richards and Kington andbaptized one. I found that Elders Richards and Kingtonhad baptized fifty confirmed 1000 ordained ten Priests andone Teacher since I last saw them. Brother Youngpreached at brother Kington's where we spent the nightWe spent a good time there and blessed the household andlaid hands upon the sick. The following day ElderKington baptized one and I spent the day with him butbrothers Young and Richards walked to Turkey HallSunday the 17th was the aniversaryI met the Saints in company with Elders Young and RichardsIn the morning I preached and in the afternoon brotherBrigham preached and while doing so opposers made muchdisturbance being determined to break up the meeting 
 the mobocratic State of Missouri.On the 25 we reached Far West and spent the nightat the house of brother Morris Phelps who was still in prison withbrother Parley P. Pratt.The next day was indeed worthy of record. TheLord had given a commandment to the Twelve to assemble uponthe building spot of the House of [the Lord] in Far West Caldwell Co Missourion the 26th day of April and their take the parting hand of the Saintsto go to the nations of the earthBut persecution had arisen to such an height thatabout ten thousand souls of the Saints had been driven fromthe State and the city of Far West almost made desolate andwaste. At the same time the Prophet Joseph and his councilwith other Elders were in prison and had been under the sentenceof death several times because of their religion and they wouldhave been put to death had not the Lord preserved themtheir lives were in His hands and not at this time in thehands of their enemies. Yet there were about thirty five ofthe Church killed at this time among whom was David W.Patten of the Twelve Apostles.These were the circumstances of that timeand moreover the Missourians had sworn that the revelationabove alluded to should not be fulfilled. Yet in spite ofall this we were now moving forthward to the building spot ofthe House of the Lord in the city of Far West. The sacred spotwas reached the Council held the revelation fulfilled and aftertaking leave of the Saints we returned thirty two miles andcamped for the night.It being a matter of historical importance I willhere give from my journal of the day the minutes ofThe Council at Far West;(Held April 26th 1839)Of The Twelve High Priests Elders and Priests.Present of The Twelve:Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt,John E. Page and John Taylor. 
 we should have to wade. We walked twenty-two miles and spent thenight with Col. Blues. In Palaski County we obtained two signaturesto the petitionOn the 17th we walked forty miles through mud and waterand spent the night with Mr Thomas Cribbin in Monroe County and onthe day following we walked eighteen miles and spent the night with MrJames P. Kellean for whom we laboured with our hands the threesucceeding days.Sunday the 22nd we preached at the house of Mr Kellean andon the following day we walked forty miles through mud and waterand stayed for the night at the house of Mr Wm. S. Clonn at secondcreek, St Francis County.On the morning of the 24th, we started as usual throughthe mud and water but I had not gone far before I was taken withsuch rheumatic pains in one of my knees that I could not travellMy companion, Elder Brown was very anxious to make a speedyjourney to the river take a steamer up the Mississippi and hastento his friends in Kirtland. He therefore thought we had betterseperate as he could travel faster than I in my lame conditionI did not object to Elder Brown's proposition although I thoughtthat I should not have been willing to leave a lone companion in the ministry in an open swamp without knowing whether he wouldbe able to walk far enough to meet again any companion moreacceptable than the wolves bears and alagators with which I wassurroundedMy fellow traveller left me sitting upon a log in the mud andwater without any food and twelves miles to the nearest house on myroad. I gazed upon him as he hastened out of my sight, thenknelt down in the mud and water and prayed unto the Lord in thename of Jesus Christ in faith that he would heal me and open myway that I might continue on my journey. The Lord heard myprayer: His Spirit descended upon me and I was healed. I arose,went on my way rejoicing, and, after walking fourteen miles waskindly received by Mr John Caspber. At this place there was quitea settlement and the people came together and filled the house.I preached to them and bore a strong testimony of the work ofGod revealed in our days.It afterwards appeared that Elder Brown only gainedthree miles upon me during the day; and in travelling thosein the evening he got lost in a thicket of brambles or Mohawk briars 
 but Elder Young arose up in the power of the Priesthood andin the name of the Great God and according to the laws ofthe land commanded order. Two of the brethrenwent to the door to keep peace one of whom was Elder RichardsThey were enabled to overcome the enemy and restore orderWe administerd the Lord's supper and confirmed five.We also ordained four Priests—namely, Thomas BrooksWilliam Simons Thomas Smith and Samuel Warren:also one Teacher—James Baldwin.A Feast Day With the Saints.The 10th of May was an interesting day to me andand my brethren who had come on the Lord's business fromour native land to establish the first mission of theChurch in the nations of Europe. It had been a customof the United Brethren to holdBut they were now members of the Church of LatterDay Saints and had received the fulness of the Gospeland as such they continued their old custom by brotherhoodAccordingly Brother Kington formerly the presidingminister and Superintendent of the Church of UnitedBrethren and now their Presiding Elder as a part of theChurch of Latter-day Saints on this day once more prepareda temporal feast for his flock.The day began to us propi[tious]At five o clock in the morning I met some friends atMr Joseph Hill's at Dymock and baptized three persons,two of whom were Churchmen and the other a WesleyanFrom thence we walked to William Hart'sElder Kington baptized sevenand Elders Brigham Young and Willard Richardsconfirmed them.

A. Jefferson and the next day travelled fourteen milesthrough the mud and water and preached at the house of WillisFields, Crittendon County. Here I obtained eleven moresignatures to my petitionMarch 27th. I travelled fourteen miles to theMississippi River crossed the ferry and walked into thecity of Memphis a stranger and alone—weary hungry andwithout money—my clothing rough dirty and nearlyragged, having walked through so much swamp waterand brush. But in this situation I called at one of themost respestable taverns in the city kept by a Mr Jacksonbetween whom and myself the following dialogue tookplace:Myself: Sir I am a servant of God—a preacher of the ^Gospel^and without purse or scrip—Will you entertainme for the night?Jackson: How do I know sir but what you are an impostor?You don't look much like a preacher. Whatdenomination are you of?Myself: I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints. It is true you do notknow but that I am an impostor; but I canshow you my licence and recomendation.Jackson: How do I know but you forged them?Myself: You do not and if you are not willing to takemy word for it I will go my way and try elsewhere.Jackson: No sir y[ou] cannot go. Give me your valise. Iwill keep you for the night and get you acongregation and you must preach to us inorder to prove whether you are an impostoror not."By this time I found that Mr Jackson really beleived thatI was an impostor. I was alone yet must confess that Ifelt somewhat mischevious. I feigned to appear as thoughI was frightened and not wish to be put to the test: at whichMr J. grew excited and I saw that he was in for fun. It 
 her. The Saints began to gather at 2 o'clock and by 5 p.m.we had nearly one hundred Saints together to the feast preparedfor them. We had indeed that day a most interestingand spiritual time as well as our social communionin temporal things. Elder Brigham Young first addressedthe Saints and was clothed with the Spirit and power ofGod. He then asked a blessing upon the food sobountifully prepared. We then sat down to the tableand eat and drank with nearly one hundred Saintswho possessed glad hearts and cheerful countenancesElder Richards remarked that he did not beleive thatthere had ever been such a company of Saints preparedin so short a time and who bid fairer for the Kingdom of Heaven than the company then assembledat least since the Church of Latter-Day Saints wasfirst organized.A Church of Four HundredRaised up By MeIn Two Months & a HalfI trurly felt grateful to my Heavenly Father whenI reflected back upon the time when I first proclamedthe fulness of the Gospel in this region and beganto baptize such as received my testimony. Only twomonths and a half a go since I came into the Hertfordshirefield of labour and now there was a Church raised of nearlyfour hundred souls and the prospect of the work constantlyincreasing.After our feasting was over thehouse was called to order by Elder Brigham who thendelivered a short address after which three were confirmedby myself and Elder Willard Richards. The were alsoordained to the office of Elder Daniel Browett and tothe office of Priest John Smith John Davis James MorganRobert Clift John Gaily and William E.

The Twelve then offered up vocal prayer in thefollowing order:Brigham Young Heber C Kimball Orson PrattJohn E Page, John Taylor Wilford WoodruffGeorge A Smith.After this we sung [A] [blank]Fulfilment of the RevelationThe Twelve then took the parting hand of the following Saints agreeable to revelation:Alpheus Cutler Elias Smith Norman Shearer Wm Berton StephenMarkham Shedrick Roundy Wm C. Clark John W. ClarkHezekiah Peck Dawin Chase Richard Howard Mary AnnPeck Artimisha Grainger Martha Peck Sarah Granger HyrumClark Theodore Turley and Daniel Shearer.The Master Mason of the House AlpheusCutler then placed the stone before spoken of in its regularposition. After which in consequence of the peculiar situationof the Saints he thought it wisdom to adjourn the work untilsome future time when the Lord should open the way to procededwith the building.We had entered into a covenant to see thepoor Saints all moved out of Missouri into Illinois and we hadspared no means to accomplish this object and the Lordhad now given us the desires of our hearts in this thingThe last comapny of the poor who could bemoved were with us in our return from Far West. Parley P.Pratt and Morris Phelps were still in prison and we wereunder the necessity of leaving them for a season.Early on the morning of the 27th wecommenced our journey from the Grove in upper Missouri wherewe had returned and camped the night before. This was32 miles from the city of Far West.The company with us consisted of seven of theTwelve, a number of the committee, and several other familes 
 suited my purpose for matters to take this turn for I was desirous to preachto the people.They sat me a table in a large hall and gave me a good supperand large Mr Jackson went into the town immediately and gave noticeto a certain class to come to his house and hear an impostorpreach and before I had finished my supper the room beganto be crowded with men in broad-cloth and ladies in silksand satins.As soon as I had done my meal the table departedover mythe heads of the people. My host gave me a chair inthe corner of the room and placed a stand before me witha Bible and a hymn-book upon it. About a dozen of thecompany formed a circle in front of me; and I saw by thecountenances of the people that they expected some fun.Commencing my meeting by reading a hymn I asked thecongregation to sing; but no one sang. I then knelt down andprayed and the men in front of me all droped upon their knees.When I arose I read the ##Romans 11|11th ch. of Romans## and preached fromthe ##Romans 11:21|21st## verse: "For if God spared not the natural branches,take heed lest he also spare not thee"I spent but a very few minutes in discourse about theJews but turned to the assembly before me and as the Spiritof God rested upon me and revealed to my understanding thewickedness of their hearts I poured it out upon them tellingthem of their wickedness whoredoms and abominations in veryplain terms. I suppose they never had their sins so plainlypointed out before. The men in front of me dropped theirheads in the early part of my discourse and I could not catchtheir eyes afterwards. Having thoroughly satisfied my mindand spoken about an hour and an half I closed the meetingand not a word was spoken by any one. The room was instantlycleared. In two minutes I was left alone and soon after thelandlady came in and lit me to bed.I had not been in bed more than an hour before a crowdof men who had attended the meeting collected in a room adjoiningmine and discussed the subject of my being an impostor or notand also my sermon. Their decision was that I was not animpostor and it puzzled them much to understand how I shouldknow so fully of their sins for I had told them much of whichthey were guilty. The subject was discussed until near midnight 
 After our meeting was closed three more were baptizedThe ordinance of baptism was administered by PriestJames Morgan who was baptized confirmed and ordainedon that and now officiated in one of the ordinances ofthe Church. There was baptized and confirmed in allthat day nineteen and ordained one Elder and six PriestsOn the following day Elders Young Richardsand myself went to Keysend Street where brother Youngpreached and after the meeting I baptized four who wereconfirmed by Elders Young and Richards as they came outof the water.May the 20th we walked to Wind Point andbrothers Young Richards and myself went on to the top of thatpart of Malvern Hill called Herefordshire Beacon. Here we united in prayerAnd Held A Council.We jointly felt that it was the will of God that Elder BrighamYoung should immediately go to Manchester to assistin publishing aCollection of Hymn BooksOf 3000 Copies.and also to immediately print and publishThree Thousand Copies of the Book of Mormonfor we had procured three hundred pounds for this purposeand was anxious to have this book of God circulatedand the knowledge of the great work connected with its comingforth published to all nations.Returning to the Vale from the Hill wetook the parting hand of Brigham Young who stardted forManchester while Elder Richards and myself tarried andpreached at Wind Point; he baptized two and confirmed one and I the other. I also ordained John Allard to the officeof Teacher.On the netxt day we again ascended to the topof the Herefordshire Beacon where we prayed together and spent 
 of the Saints. We continued our journey and crossed theMississippi River steam ferry at Quincy on the 2nd dayof May being five days on our road from the Grove.The next day I had the unspeakable happinessof visiting JosephThe Prophet out of PrisonMyself and five others of the Twelve rodefour miles out of town to Mr Cleaveland's to see brotherJoseph. He had just been delivered from prisonand from the hands of his enemies and had returnedto the bosom of his family and friends. His brotherHyrum Lyman Wight and two others of the brethrenwho had been imprisoned with him had also justreceived their deliverence with him. They had beenconfined in prison about six months and had beenunder sentence of death three times. But their liveswere in the hands of God and could not be taken bytheir enemies.They were now at home and we were intheir midst—all rejoicing together. Joseph was frank openand familiar as usual & sister Emma was truly happy.The Bishops of the Church were also presentTwo years had rolled away since I hadseen the Prophet Joseph's face and absense had servedto strengthen the strong union that made us one in theNew and Everlasting Covenant. When we arrived he greetedus with joy and after spending the day rejoicing togetherour company returned to Quincy.On the day following which was May 4thA General Conferencecommenced in the morning on the Presbyterian camp groundtwo miles north of Quincy. Joseph was with the Churchagain and was presiding over a General Conference. It wasan interesting time and it truly gave the Saints great joy tohave their beloved Prophet with them again. During the day 
 when some negroes came and broke open the turkey roost and they all put after the theives and this enabled me to go to sleep.In the morning I arose and took breakfast and then enabledupon Mr. Jackson who was in his store and thanked him for hiskindness and entertainment. He said I was welcome andthat if ever I came that way again he wished me to callupon him and that I should be welcome to all that his houseafforded. I then went on my way walked thirty-two milesand was kindly entertained for the night and over Sundayby a Mr John A Logwood who was termed an infidlelby the Christian world.Sunday, March 29th, I attended in the forenoona Presbytarian meeting. The sermon was about ten minuteslong; but its shortness was its best feature; for it was devoidof sense knowledge and light. This was in Fayett^e^ CountyHere I obtained two signatures to the petition.Monday the 30th, I walked thirty-five miles andspent the night with sqr. Hardamand in Hardamand Co.Being very weary I went to bed early; but as there was aball that night in honor of the return of the sqr's two sonsfrom college and dancing until 2 o'clock in the morning Igot but little sleep. Mr Hardaman lived in greatsplendor. At breakfast time next morning, when histable was surrounded by ladies and gentemen, he askedme if we beleived in music and dancing. He was anEpiscopalian and esteemed highly those amusements. Ireplied in a spirit of pleasentry that we did not considerit essential to salvation to which he returned in thesame spirit that he did and so should not join ourChurch. Starting again on my jorney I walked twenty-four miles and spent the night with Mr. Jacob Sipes andpreached in his house. This was in Madison Co.April 1st, I travelled thirty miles, crossedMount Pinson and spent the night with David BeardHenderson Co.; and on the next day I jorneyed throughPleasent Grove Lexington and Maple Springs and spentthe night with Mr Wm. Morrell in Carrol County.On the 3rd, I walked fourteen miles and stopedat the house of brother Cade Crawley in Humphry's CountyHe was the first Saint whom I had met in Tennessee. 
 several hous in viewing the country around. Retur[n]ing tothe Valley Elder Richards baptized two persons. We preachedat Colwall that evening and there was also ordaind by uson this day three PriestsOn the 22nd I went over Malvern Hillwith Brother Richards and had a splendid view of the Valebeneath. We stoped at the [blank] half way downthe hill and brother Richards engraved his name withmine in the building. We went into the Valley anddined after which we walked up to the Holy Well Houseand drank of the Holy Water of great note which comesout of Malvern Hill. After visiting several friends eastof the Hill we ascended to the top of Great Malvern whichis the highest peak of any part of the hill. Here we couldoverlook all the hills and surrounding country. We boweddown and offered up prayer unto God and then [nt]by the west side and preached at Malvern Hill We then walked to brother Jinkins at Moorend's Crosswhere we spent that night and the next day and blessedthe family of our worthy brother and host.Sunday the 24th I walked to OldStarridge Common to attend a camp Meeting. I preachedin the morning and brother Willard Richards in theevening after which we broke bread with the SaintsThree were baptized by me and we ordained threePriests and one teacherThe next day was spent in lookingup the aged and infirm and we baptized as manyas would receive our testimony. I baptized six andbrother Richards confirmed them one of whom waseighty years of age. We also preached at Dunn's Clossand the next day at Bishops Froome27th we baptized Charlotte Pullinwho had been a cripple from her birth and she receiveda blessing after which we walked to Stokes Lane andpreached, confirmed ten persons into the church andordained two Priests and one Teacher and on the 20th I baptized 4 at Cricks Green who were confirmed 
 there was much important business accomplished and the conferencecontinued through the next day which was Sunday. At its closea collection was taken up for the poor.On the 6th of May I met with the Quorum ofthe Seventies and after some counselling there were sixty ordained intothe seventies.After this I with the Twelve and Bishops metbrother Joseph at the house of Bishoph Partridge where we againhad an interesting time. This ended the Conference.Several brethren who attended this conferencehad been wounded by the Missourian mob. I will hererelateA Remarkable Incident of the PersecutionBrother Isaac Leany was in company with about20 others at Hawn's Mills in upper Missouri when a largearmed mob fell upon them with loaded rifles and otherweapons and shot down seventeen of the Saints and murderedthem in cold blood.Brother Leany fled from the scene for life andwhile fleeing the mob poured forth a shower of balls upon himwhich pierced his body through and through. He showedme eleven holes in his body and there wasere 27 in his shirt7 in his pantaloons and his coat was literally cut to rags.One ball entered his body at one arm pit and came out atthe other; another ball entered the back and came out of thebreast and balls passed through each hip each leg and eacharm. All thiese wasere received while runing for life.Strange in fact miraculous as it was all thesewounds with the addition of a broken rib from one of the balls yet the speed of this brother was not lessened but he entirelyout-run his pursuers and saved his life.This is as remarkable a case as ever recorded inhistory of a man being literally riddled with balls besides havinghis clothes almost cut to rags on his back with the shower oflead and yet to outrun his pursuers and save his life just asthough only a few pees had been showered after him. He was at this Conference now; and we can only acknowledge hismiraculous preservation to be by the power and mercy of God. 
 Elders David W. Patten and Warren Parrish had arriveda short time before and had baptized over twenty persons in thisregion. I was truly rejoiced to meet any of the Saints as I hadtravelled several hundred miles alone; and I felt it a happyprivilege when after walking five miles next day I met ElderWarren ParrishElder Parrish was travelling and preaching almost dailybaptizing such as would receive his testimony. He wished meto join him in his ministerial labors and I did so; and welabored together during a period of about three months travelling fromplace to place and preaching nearly every day. We held several debatesadministered to the sick and baptized twenty-six up to the dateof the 28th of June. In this interval I also wrote two letters tothe Saints in Zion, one to Arkansas and one to my parents.On the 23rd of June we received a letter from OliverCowdery containing a request for Elder Parrish to return toKirtland as he was one of the Seventies chosen. He alsostated that it was wisdom for me to remain in the South andto take charge of the Churches which we had raised up. Iwas instructed to labor in great humility and told that Ishould lose nothing as there were other Seventies to be chosenand that I should be remembered.My Autobiography is not about to branch into my ordinationto the office of Elder and to take in an account of my laborswhile holding that office. I will therefore close this chapter bysubjoining the following synopsis:Synopsis of My Travels, Etc.Travels As A Teacher:I travelled while holding the office of Teacher from the 11th of April 1834to the 25th of June following; from Richmond Oswego County NewYork to Kirtland Ohio 336 miles; from thence to Clay CountyMissouri in company with Zions camp 902, making a total of 1238milesAs A Priest:While holding the office of Priest I travell in Missouri 212 miles; inArkansas 656; in Tennessee and Kentucyky 950, making 1818 miles. 
 by Elder Richards. We then walked to Hope Rush and preachedwhere I baptized five more who were also confirmed bybrother RichardsOn this day we visited the greatest curiosityof Evergreen known in Europe or in any part of the worldso far as I can learn. This Evergreen was upon the farmknown as Hopton in the Hole in the Parish of Much CowenHerefordshire and owned by Richard Gardner. It was in acircular form inclosing about one acre composed of Yew treesgrowing out and standing in the midst of a border of BoxBrush. The yew trees were about in the form of a highand well built hay or wheat stack and were suposed to beseveral humdred years old. This Evergreen was surrounded bya canal of water.Our labours of the following day commencedwith my baptizing two at the creek who were confirmed byElder Richards and then we walked to Sucknell Hill andpreached after which I baptized three more one of whom wasa preacher and ordained one PriestNext day Elder Richards baptized twowhom I confirmed and then we walked to Froom's Hillto spend the night at brother Benbow's.

Indescribing my journey and the incidents thereof I followeda consecutive daily detail and shall adopt the same format times hereafter when it appears most suitable but as ingeneral one days record must be very similar to thoseof many days so as a general rule I shall not follow adiary form. My journals will show that as a ruleevery day was spent in the active performance ofministerial duties in daily travels and daily preachingfrom place to place. I shall only note in this historythat which contains some leading incident or which hasa variation worthy of notice. 
 One of the letters received by us was from BrighamYoung at Manchester informing us that the first No of theMillennial Starwas published and that theHymn Book and Book of Mormonwould soon beIn TypeAnother of the letters was from Sister Richards and onealso from Elder Whitehead and there was so much glorious news that sleep was driven from our eyes for the night.

There wasa large congregation of various denominations Aafter the meetingwe repaired to a house and broke bread. Eight were confirmedand one baptized by Bro Spires.The next day I walked to Deerhurst and preachedand at night I dreamed I saw a large church on fire. The steplewhich was high was in flames.

 high and the banks all overflown that I could not see thefording-place and as my horse went off the bank he plunged intoa hickery-tree-top and became entangled in the limbs and well-nigh drowned. I had my valice fastened to the saddle and awalking-cane in my hand which I did not wish to lose.

We repared to the water and the Spirit of theLord rested upon us while I administered the divineordinance to them. Three of the men also led theirwives down into the water and they were baptised.This day I obtained two subscribers for the Messengerand Advocate and two more in the several followingdays. I also wrote on the 24th a letter to JohnWhitmore which was published in the Messenger andAdvocate page 237.While holding service at the house of brotherWest November 3rd two had the gift of tongues and onthe 14th of the same month at the house of brother Campthe Spirit of God rested upon us and the signs followedthe beleivers according to the promises made by Christand his ancient Apostles and renewed in theseLatter-days. At this date I had the satisfaction ofintroducing two into the Church through the ordinanceof baptism and five more on the following day werein like manner added to the Church of God andthus the work grew and florished daily.After baptizing the five persons on the 15thwe mounted our horses to ride to Clark's River in companywith five brethren and two sisters. Among the numberwere Seth Otlay and Benjamen F. Clapp. There hadbeen a hard storm of rain which had swollen thestreams. When we came to the one we had to crosswe found we could not without swiming our horsesand as there were females with us it was considereddangerous to make the attempt. We tried to headthem sufficient to ford and while doing so the 
 Ten members were confirmed and seven children blessed underthe hands of Elders Woodruff and Kington. Elder Daniel Browettwas appointed to represent the Gadfield's Elm conference at theGeneral Conference at Manchester and ordered that the clerkpresent to the Presiding Elders for safe keeping and also to the GeneralConference a copy of the minutes of this. Upon motion ofPresident Willard Richards the conference was adjourned untilthe 13th of September of the same year.After the close of the conference the Elders andother officers present met in council and arranged that a weeklycouncil of the Priesthood should be held alternately on theSouth and North sides of the River Severn to commence atLeigh on the 26th of June and organized the same by appointingElder Daniel Browett President and John Hill clerk of theseweekly councils of Priesthood on the South side. TheNorth side was ^also^ organized by the appointment of ElderWilliam Jinkins President and John Smith clerk: thefirst council to assemble on the 9th of the next July atTurkey Hall. After other business of a minor nature thecouncil adjourned and it is worthy of remark that there hadnot been that day either in conference or council a dissentingvoice.June 15th we walked to Dymock and I continued to Ryton and preached and then returned toDymock and the next day went to Lugwardine andpreached at the house of the father of Elder Philip Greenwhen three were baptized by Elder Green, and by ElderRichards and myself confirmed eleven and ordained twoPriestsThe following day I baptized six andWillard Richards confirmed them after which we walkedto Marden and preached at the house of William Jay andbaptized and confirmed four. This day we baptized 10and confirmed them blessed four children and laid handsupon and healed seven who were sickThe day after I baptized five whichwe then confirmed. We also ordained Francis Burnetto the office of Priest blessed 6 children administered 
 confidence in him. Such angels are Saints with their resurrectedbodies.But if a personage appears unto a man as an angel oflight and offers him his hand and the man when he essays totake hold of the proffered hand feels nothing nor senses any substancehe may know that this is the Devil; for when a Saint whosebody is not resurrected appears unto a man in the flesh he willnot offer his hand for this would be against the law givenhim. In keeping in mind such keys of knowledge we maybe enabled to detect the Devil that he deceive us not.The following day I let the Bishops have my fortyacre lot in Far West Missouri. I deeded it to a man by the nameof Blesens in payment of the landing point four miles south ofthe garrison in Montrose.The time had now arrived for us who were appointedto leave our families and the bosom of the Church and start uponOur Mission to the Nations.On the 2nd of July the Presidency—Joseph andhis Council came across the river to Montrose to spend the daywith the Twelve to bless them and their families before theyleft for other nations.In the forepart of the day we rode four milesdown the river to see the place called Blesens-point where theSaints were expecting to buildJoseph pronounced it good and wereturned and the whole company dined at my dwelling consistingof about twelve persons.After dinner we all assembled for meeting at the house of Brigham Young. Hyrum Smith havingopened the meeting by prayer the Presidency laid their hands uponmy head and sealed a blessing upon me. President Rigdonwas the speaker in setting apart and blessing me. They alsoset apart and blessed Elders George A Smith and TurleySisters Young and Taylor with my wife were likewise blessedIn our blessings for our mission to Europewe received the promise that if we were faithful we should 
 darkness of night with a hard storm of wind and rain overtookus and we became lost in the thick woods. We had neither firelight nor road but was in darkness rain mud and tree-topsWe crossed the stream about 20 times and had [it] not been forour horses and the females in our company we should haveappeared far more like fishermen than travellers. I thoughtof Paul's perils by water. [##Acts 27##] But the Lord was merciful tous; for while we were in the wood groping as the blindfor the wall, suffering under the blast of wind and rain,a light suddenly shone around about us without aid eitherof the sun moon or stars and it revealed to us that wewere in danger of killing both ourselves and animals byriding off steep bluffs. We were on the edge of a deep gulf whenthe light appeared which continued with us until we founda house and were put on the right road. The light thendisappeared and the darkness returned: yet we reached thehouse of brother Henry Thomas at 9 o'clock in the eveningwithout having received any hurt either to ourselves or horses.We were five hours in the storm and had ridden twentymiles and crossed creeks about as many times as the mileswe had travelled. All were impressed with the careof Providence towards and we felt to return the Lord thanksfor our preservation and his blessings so signally markedin our history of that day. This surely deserves noticeas one of the episodes of my life and an instance ofdeliverance from the Lord in a time of need.Two days after the above remarkable incidentI was called out in the night to view the signs in theheavens. There were three clouds seen having the appearenceof fire and blood. One was in the West another in theEast and the third in the North, each appearing about thesize of an acre of ground. They arose from the horizonto the zenith and frequently changed their position. This was November the 17th. On this day also I had baptizedone, ordained Daniel Thomas a Teacher and organized theDamon Creek Branch of the Church; afterwards I rode 12 milesand the place where at night I witnessed the above singularphenomon. DeceDecember 1st, I spent in writing to John Whitmoreand Warren Parrish at Kirtland and on the next day met 
 to two who were sick and then walked to Shucknell Hillwhere we preached and had an interesting time. ElderWillard Richards spoke from the text "If the Lord be Godserve Him." The power of the Priesthood rested upon himand the principles of eternal truth were presented so plain that noopposing power could stand them. After he closed I arose andbore my testimony to what the congregation had heardThe church minister of the parish hadsent a spy to our meeting to carry him word concerningwhat was preached. As soon as the meeting closedI put my hand upon his shoulder and asked himwhat he thought of our doctrine and he replied "Ithink it is of God." He appeared astonished whenhe left the house. Almost every person with whomI conversed said that they wished to be baptizedas soon as an opportunity offered. Several werebaptized by Elder Green after their return homeand one after the meeting by Priest Williams.We had baptized on this daysix persons and confirmed them ordained two Priestsblessed thirteen children and healed two who were sickThe night was spent at brother Williams.On the morning of the followingday I arose early and baptized and confirmed oneand a number of others soon came to us and requestedto be baptizedWe immediately walked to the RiverLug but being hindered for a short time in looking for a place suitable for the purpose a man by thename of Pitt up to us filled with the devil and atthe head of a mob and commanded us not tobaptize in that river and threatened us much if wedid so. Elder Richards preached to him and warnedhim to repent but the Devil raged so much in himand his company that we deemed it wise to posponethe administeration of the ordinanceWe retired and went our way butthis wicked wman and the mob followed us shouting 
 return to the bosom of our familes after having great successupon our mission and many souls as seals of our ministry.Brother Hyrum Smith afterwards gave ussome beneficial counsel relative to our mission and advisedas best to only preach the first principles of the GospelJoseph then arose and gave to us someof the precious things of the Kingdom in the power of the HolyGhost. He said in substance what I here record inthe following synopsis ofJoseph's Charge to the Twelve!!"Ever keep in exercise the principles of mercyand be ready to forgive your brotherren on the first signsof repentance and his asking forgiveness; and should weeven forgive our brother or our enemy before he ask it ourHeavenly Father will he equally as merciful unto us. Weought also to be willing to confess all our sins and keepnothing back.Let the Twelve be humble and not beexaulted and beware of pride. Seek not to exalt yourselvesone above another nor to excel one another but act for each other's good. We should honorably make mention ofeach other's name in our prayers before the Lord and beforeour fellow men and not backbite and devour our brother.Why will not man learn wisdom fromprecept and example? Why at this late age of the worldmust we be obliged to learn everything we know by sadexperience?Must the new ones who are chosen to fillthe places of those who are fallen of the quorum of the Twelvebegin to exalt themselves until they get so high as to tumbleover and have a great fall? Must they do so and afterwardsgo wallowing through the mire and be left in darkness & Judaslike be delivered to the buffatings of Satan as several of theTwelve before? [##Matthew 27:3-5##] Or will they learn wisdom from experienceand be wise? O God give them wisdom and keep them humble I pray! 
 Elder E. F. Wells who became a co-laborer with me for a shorttime.On the 8th I wrote letters to my father and motherand my brother Asahel H. WoodruffAfter preaching at the house of Benjamin L. Clapp,on the 19th, I baptized five persons, four men and oneawoman. One of the number was a Campbellite preacher.The next day at Clark's River where I preached a mob offifty men gathered against me. It was led by aBaptist priest; but after questioning me upon one pointthe leader advised them not to lay hands upon any man for his religious principles. The advise was goodand it was taken. I preached again at night andbaptized three persons.The last day of the year I spent at brotherTaylor's when I perused my journal and made up a summary of my travels and proceedings during 1835commencing January 13th. This summary and myclosing reflections of the year I will give here at the endof this chapter, copied from the "first book" of the first vol.of my journals.Miles Travelled:I travelled during the year th[r]ee thousand two hundredand forty-eight.Meetings Held.I held one hundred and seventy meetings.Churches Built Up.I planted organized and built up three ChurchesNumber BaptisedI baptized forty-three, of whom three wereCampbellite Priests."Messenger and Advocate"For the Messenger and Advocate I procured twentysubscribers and for the reprinted "Star" two.The PetitionI obtained seventy-three signatures to the Petition tothe Govenor of Missouri for redress of wrongs donethe Church by Jackson County mob.LettersI wrote eighteen letters and received ten. 
 hooting and yelling, but the Saints were strengthened seeingthey were not of the world and therefore the world hatedthem and we went on our way rejoicing that we werepersecuted for the Gospel's sake.Afterwards we walked to Froom's Hilland found brother and sister Benbow zrejoicing exceedinglyin the Lord. I baptized one person here and administeredunto one sick and tarried at Brother BenbowsJune 20th was spent in companyof Elders Richards & Kington in arranging for theFroom's Hill conference. It was an exceedingly busyday for we had much buisness to attend to. Amongthe duties of this day I baptized eight persons andwe confirmed fourteen administered to the sick andblessed three children. The power of God was in themidst of the people and bringing about a marvellouswork in this part of the land. There were nowfive hundred souls number in church in the Herefordshire mission.[FIGURE]MINUTESof theFROOM'S HILL CONFERENCEheld atSTANDLY HILL CASTLEFROOM HEREFORDSHIREENGLAND,JUNE 21st 1840The Preachers and members of the Froom's Hillcircuit of United Brethren met at the houseof Elder John Cheese on Standly Hill Herefordshire EnglandJune 21st A.D. 1840 at 10 o'clock a.m. when the meetingwas called to order by Elder Thomas Kington and ElderWillford Woodruff was chosen President and Elder John Benbow clerk of the meeting 
 "When the Twelve or any other of the witnesses ofJesus Christ stand before the congregations of the earth and preachin power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and the peopleare astonished and confounded at the doctrine and shall say thatman has preached a powerful discourse—a great sermon, thenlet that man or those men take care that they do not ascribe theglory unto themselves but be careful that they are humble andascribe the praise and glory to God and the Lamb for it isby the power of the Holy Priesthood and the Holy Ghost thatthey have the power thus to speak.What art though O man but dust and fromwhom dost thou receive thy power and blessing but fromGod! Then O ye Twelve notice this key and be wise forChrist sake and your own souls sake.Ye are not sent out to be taught but to teach.Let every man be sober and vigilent and let all his words beseasened with grace. Keep in mind also that it is a day of warningand not of many words.Act honestly before God and beware of Gentilesophestry such as bowing and scraping unto men in whom youhave no confidence. Be honest open and frank in all yourintercourse with mankind.And O ye Twelve and all Saints profit bythis important key which I now give you: In all your trialstroubles and temptations afflictions bonds imprisonment and deathsee to it that you do not betray heaven that you do notbetray Jesus Christ that you do not betray your brethren andthat you do not betray the revelations of God whether in theBible Book of Mormon Doctrine and Covenants or any of the word of God. Yea in all your kickings and flounderingssee to it that you do not this thing lest inocent blood be foundin your skirts and you go down to hell!We may ever know bythat there is danger ofour being led to a fall and apostacy when we give way to theDevil so as to neglect the first known duty but whateveryou do, never betray your friend!"[FIGURE] 
 DebatesI held three debates or answered when publicly opposed.MobsThree companies in the form of mobs gathered against meyet I suffered no harm.Members Confirmed.I confirmed into the Church thirty-five persons.ExcommunicationsI expelled seven from the Church but not while hope remainedReflections of the Year."The accobefore mentioned is an account of my proceedings ofthe year 1835, which has borne to heaven its report of meand of all men. Could the year not have borne morewelcome news? Ah! but it cannot be recalled. The sableshades of night already speaks the departure of 1835 and thequeen of night is showing forth her silver light to welcome thedawn of 1836 which approaches us in calm to go out in astorm! O momentous and important year which will hurlthy millions to the tomb, shake kingdoms and bespeak aGod in Israel! When the Lord speaks who can but prophesy!O God enable my heart and hands to be clean for a yearto come!"Thus ends the year 1835 and the eighth chapterof my history commences with a new year to me evenmore eventful than the one here closed.[FIGURES]Chapter VIIINothing particular beyond the daily duties of the ministry occurredin the year 1836 until Feb 26th when we held our first conferenceof the Southern Churches at which I presided. Upon a vote beingBtaken for their ordination I proceeded to ordain Abraham O. SmootBenjamin Boydstun Elders; Daniel Thomas and Benjamin Clapppriests and Henry Thomas and John Camp Deacons: after whichseven Branches were represented comprising 103 members seven of whomwere scattered.Towards the middle of AprMarch Elder Abraham O Smootcommenced travelling with me to preach the Gospel 
 After prayer by Elder Willard Richards and remarksby the President of the meeting it was moved by Elder Kingtonand seconded by Elder Benbow that this circuit hereafter beknown by the name of the Froom's Hill conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints organized and established by the will and commandment of God inthe United States of America on the 6th of June A.D. 1830It was moved by Willard Richards and seconded by Thomas Kington that Thomas Clark James HillCharles Price and Samuel Jones be ordained Elders: also thatJohn Jones John Morgan Joseph Shinn Samuel BadhamHenry Jones John Dyer & James Baldwin be ordained Priests:also that Robert Hill James Shinn George Brook's and James Watkinsbe ordained Teachers (carried unanimously) and these brethren wereordained under the hands of Elders Richards and Woodruff. The following arrangements of branches and presiding officers werethen made in the organization of the conference:   Froom's Hill under the care of Priest John James    [Froom's Hill] assistant Priest John Morgan    Standly Hill under the care of Priest John Parry    [Standley Hill assistant Joseph Pullen    [Standley Hill Teacher Robert Hill    Ridgway Cross under the care of Priest James Barnes    Moor End Cross under the care of Priest William Possons    [Moor End Cross] assistant Priest William Jinkings    [Moor End Cross] Teacher Thomas Jenkins    Colwall care of Priest Jonathan Lucy    Pale house care of Thomas Jones.

 The Sunday following was July the 7th whichwas an important day in my history. In company oftwo of the Twelve and about one hundred Saints I andMrs Woodruff crossed in the ferry boat from Montrose toCommerce to attend meeting that the Twelve might deliver theirfarewell address before they left for EnglandWhen we arrived at the place of meetingElder John E. Page was speaking. He occupied the standin the fore-part of the day and spoke much of the proof ofthe Book of Mormon.In the afternoon brother John Taylor spoke I followed and afterwards Orson Hyde and Brigham YoungPresident Rigdon then addressed us with remarks peculiarlyadapted to the circumstances of the Twelve taking theirdeparture from all they held dear on earth to go to othernations to bear the testimony of God's work and revelation ofthe last days. His appeal to our affections was so powerfultouching our parting from our wives and children thetrying circumstances that surrounded our families the perilsthat we might meet and the blessings we should receive &c.Tears were brought from many an eye while he addressed usJoseph then spoke to us a few wordsand said, "Remember brethren, if you are imprisoned brotherJoseph has been imprisoned before you; if you areplaced where you can only see your brethren only throughthe grates of a window while in irons because of the Gospelof Jesus Christ, remember brother Joseph has been in likecircumstances."After this manner were his remarksand then the meeting closed and three were baptised.The third day after this I spent withJoseph and some of the Twelve in arranging a selection ofhymns for the Church and two days later I assissted JohnTaylor in looking over the proof shee[t] of the first Number of the "Times and Seasons"We afterwards had interview withthe Presidency and also Elder Kimball. We also administeredto the sick and Joseph called upon the Twelve to visit andlay hands upon Father Smith that he might be healed 
 On the 19th of April I rode to brother Levi Taylor's on Bloody, Ten;and there learnt that Elder David Patten one of the first Twelvehad arrived and was at Col. Copeland's. This was to me gloriousnews. I proceeded thence to John Rowley's where I had the pleasureof an interview with Elder Smoot who had been with Elder Pattenand his wife for several days. He related the glorious news communicatedto him and gave an account of the endowments at Kirtland Ohiorelating that the Heavens were opened and angels were seen andJesus sitting on the right hand of the Father. I was farther toldthat Elder Warren Parrish one of the first Seventy and some othersof the first Elders were expected to visit us and that there wasalso a Seventcond Seventy chosen and that I was one of them. Two days afterwards I had an interview with brother and sister Patten.May 28th a conference was held at brother Seth Utlay'sagreeable to appointment at which Elder David Patten presidedand Warren Parrish acted as clerk. The usual business of Conferenceswas taken up and on the next day Sunday we had a good timeand much of the Spirit and power of God and though we werethreatend by wicked men we were not harmed. After communingwith the Saints we closed by singing, The Spirit of God likea fire is burning.The last of May was thus far the most interesting &important day of my life for on this day I was ordained oneof the Second Seventies. My ordination was requested bythe Presidency of the Church at Kirtland. There wereglorious things pronounced upon my head by the Spirit ofprophecy and revelation. It was said that my enemies wouldstrive to take my life but that God would deliver me out oftheir hands; that the Lord would give me the desire of myheart and that his eye had been upon me all my life longto prepare me for this work; that I should travel to the nationsof the earth and the Islands of the sea to proclaim the word of God.I will here incorporate a true copy ofThis certifiesThat Wilford Woodruff has been ordained into the Churchof Latter-day Saints organized on the 6th of April in the year of

 As a close to the scenes of this day we received the welcomeintelligence of the escape of Parley P. Pratt and others from prison wherethey had been confined seven months.

 Three days after this time of miraculous powerI was for the first time in my life was attacked withthe chills and fever. A number of the quorum of the Twelve were taken ill, and the Evil One strove to bindus down that we should not go into the vineyardI continued still to have the fever agueevery other day. Thus ^So^ it was also that ^with^ the others of theTwelve ^who^ like myself prepared for our departure ^when^ sick andnear^igh^ to death and leaving our families under tryingcircumstances. And not only were we battling withdisease previous to our starting from our friends andhomes to sojourn in a foreign land but thus it wasand thus ^when we left^ and thus farther disease followed onour track for several months and the Destroyer sought to lay us low.The time came for me to leave myfamily to carry the Gospel of Jesus to the nations of Europein fulfilment of the command of God. Accordingly Ileft my parting blessing with my wife and took my farewellof her and other Saints on the morning of the 8th of Oct ^August^ 1839.We left Montrose and crossed the Mis^sissippi^for the purpose of commencing a journey of about six thousandmiles to preach the Gospel in Europe. We started withoutpurse or scrip^t^ and that too with the fever and ague restingupon me every other day. I left ^started^ in company of ElderJohn Taylor and we were the first of the Twelve wholeft Nauvoo on this important mission. The rest expectedto follow us immediatelyOn the second day of our journey we passed through Carthage and arrived at brother Perkin's where we stopeduntil 12 o'clock during which I was suffering under powerfulague and fever. We continued in the afternoon and rode ina wagon with brother Perkins 25 miles to bro. Carlos Smith's.It was over a rough road and I suffered much this day. The fever was all the time heavy upon me and it seemed thatI should shake to piceces in the wagon.We tarried in this region some days and the Saints contribited a little means to help us on our

He was a predestinarian but what was more remarkablehe was also inclined to the faith of a Mr Hunt who claimedto be Moses. I make record of this because others in these daysof false Christs and false prophets have put forth the extravagentclaim to be Moses the Prophet come again.On the 14th of July wrote a letter to President OCowdery Kirtland, sent him nine subscribers for the Messengerand Advocate and gave him an account of my proceedingsI rode to Col. Solomon Copeland's on the 19th where Ilearnt that Elders David Patten and Warren Parrish had addresseda letter to the Col., stating that the Sheriff and other officers ofBenton County, Ten. had issued a warrant against themand myself. The crime alledged against us was that we hadtaught that Christ would come in this generation and that wesaid that some individuals would receive the Holy Ghostin twenty-four hours. As I was absent I was not takenbut Elders Patten and Parrish were by an armed mob, inreality, about fifty in number and bound under a bondof two thousand dollars for their appearence in Court:Brothers Seth Utley and Albert Petty were their bondsmen.On the Tuesday following they appeared at Court toplead their cause like St. Paul but were deprived of everyprivilege which both the laws of God and man accordElder Parrish in some degree pled his own cause but no evidencewas allowed to be produced nor lawful hearing granted themThe judges decided this mock trial to suit the ungodly rabble andcondemned them without any cause or guilt being found inthem. And stranger still than this judicial farce was itssequel. After condemning them they let them go clear thoughthe mob desired to beat them first but they were notpermitted this outrage.August 2nd I took Jude the Beast that I had been riding 
 The President of the meeting followed by ElderWillard Richards then gave instruction to Saints concerningthe order of the Church and the duties of the members andbore their testimony to the multitude of the truth of the workThey were followed by Elder Kington after which it wasmoved by Willard Richards and seconded by Willford Woodruff thatthe conference assembled should be adjourned until the21st of September next 10 o'clock a.m.(carried unanimously)After singing and prayer the assembly dispersed andthe Elders and officers wentInto Counciland chose Elder Willford Woodruff President andElder John Benbow clerkWillard Richards opened the meeting by prayer and thenmotioned that we proceed to establish and organized monthlycouncils of the Priesthood of the Froom's Hill conference tocommence on Friday the 3rd of the next July at half past 7o'clock p.m. in the several divisions of the conference respectivelyassigned to the different Elders as follows:   Dun's Close council President Elder Thomas Clark     Standing clerk James Meeks    Wind Point council President Elder Samuel Jones     Standing clerk William Williams    Lugwardine council President Elder Philip Green     Standing clerk Francis Burnet    Stoke's Lane council President Elder John Cheese     Standing clerk George Allen    Moor End Cross council President Elder Charles Price     Standing clerk Thomas Jenkins    Standly Hill council President Elder James Hill     Standing clerk Joseph Pullen    Froom's Hill. council President Elder John Benbow     Standing clerk John Morgan     It was farther moved by Elder Richards and secondedby Elder Kington that a monthly General Council of theofficers of the Conference be held at Standly Hill to commence

On the 14th of August brother George Miller gaveus a horse and we started on our journey travelled to the Illinoisriver and crossed at Beardstown and continued four miles makingthirty-eight during the dayOn the morrow we reached Springfield andattended meeting. I addressed the Church in a few words andElder John Taylor followed me. We had travelled forty milesthis day and I felt very wearied.In Springfield Elder Taylor engaged a printerto print 15 hundred copies of a brief sketch of the persecutionsand sufferings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintsby the inhabitants of Missouri.With Father Coltrin I rode to Rochester onthe 17th and had the pleasure of greeting some of the FoxIsland friendsWe continued our journey on the 21stand on the 25^4^th we left the State of Illinois and passed intoIowa. We crossed the Wabash and stoped at Dr Modesett amember of our Church. I was much fatigued and had feverNotwithstanding my fatigue and fever Ihad an interview during the evening with a Mr Adams whohad been a constant companion of my brother Asahel for severalyears.Mr Adams spoke highly of my brother andof the strictness of his principles. He said Asahel got along well inhis business until the last year of his life. He bought a largequantity of books and they did not sell as well as he expectedand he was in consequnce not able to meet all his engagementsThis was a source of much regret to him and the maincause of his estate becoming insolventDuring the last year of his life he manifesteda greater desire than ever to improve his mind. He readmany of Tom. Paine's works and they tended more fully toestablish him in the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed throughthe Prophet Joseph in the last days. Ashahel consideredPaine's writings easy to be refutedMy brother was more free in opening his 
 for the last year belonging to brother Samuel West out of her stable to rideto Greenhill School house to attend to an appointment for preaching. I foundher very sick and we concluded that she had been poisoned. I rode her tothe meeting and preached and thence fohur miles which was the last anyperson ever rode her. The next day after much suffering she died. I openedher and became convinced that she was poisoned which indeed was alsoacknowledged by one who knew the fact. Elder Smoot's horse also metthe same fate being poisoned by wicked men who very likely would nothave hesitated much in administering a similar potion to us. Thusended the life of poor Jude who had carried me thousands of miles andhad carried others also on the same errand—to preach the Gospel. This leftme to travel on foot.On the eleventh I met brother and sister Patten who had beendriven from Benton County, Ten., by a lawless mob on an account oftheir religion. Himself and brother Parrish had both been hunted fromplace to place by the ungodly rabble until Elder Parrish had leftfor Kirtland. Benton County mob had organized themselves intoan indipendent company to beat and kill the Elders of the Latter-day Saints if they came into that countyOn the 23rd at a meeting we heard that brother President [Patten]had received a letter from Zion from President Marsh bringing theintelligence that the Saints were about to leave Clay County and colonizeby themselves in consequence of a mob that was rising against them andthat Elder Marsh was about to visit us.September the 2nd we held our Conference at which werePresidents Marsh and David W. Patten Counsellor Elisha H Grovesand Elders W. Woodruff A. O. Smoot D. Cathcart and B. BoydstunThe conference took the subject into consideration and decided uponthe propriety of calling upon the Presidency of the Seventies for ministersof the Gospel from their Quorums to fill the vacancies for preachingin this district of country. It was voted that Presidents Marsh andPatten write to said Presidents for six faithful laborers and it wasfarther resolved that as Elder Woodruff and others were about to leavefor Kirtland the Presidency of the High Priest Quorum should berequested to send an High Priest to watch over the Churches in the South. It was also resolved that a petition should be sent to the Editorand Proprietor of the Saints Messenger and Advocate requestinghim to publish in addition a monthly periodical large enoughto contain the interesting letters of the Elders abroad! The Conferencelasted several days. 
 on Friday the 17th of the next July at half past seven o'clock p.m.with Elder Thomas Kington President and Elder John Benbowstanding clerk (carried unanimously)The President, Willford Woodruff, then explained the natureof the Priesthood and the duties and privileges of the officers andgave such instruction as their situation required. He was followedby Elder Willard Richards who touched upon many importantprinciples connected with the building up of the kingdomThe minutes of the council was then read and accepted andhaving sung The Spirit of God like a fire is burning Willard Richardsgave the benediction and the brethren separated with feelings ofgratitude and thanksgiving that God had been with his people andlove and union prevailed in all the deliberations of that day.President of the Day Willford WoodruffClerk John BenbowMarvellous indeed had been the work of God inthe Herefordshire mission. Less than four months sincethe Gospel was first preached in this region of country—less than four months since I was moved by the Spirit toopen this mission and led as by the hand of God to Froom'sHill to the house of brother John Benbow and now therewere raise up two organized conferences consisting ofChurches 33 Members 534Officers 75Viz. Elders 10 Priests 52 Teachers 13June 22nd Willard Richards and myself spent the morningat Elder John Benbows in arranging the minutes of the conferenceJust as we were about to leave Frooms Hill onthe same day we were called upon to baptize five personsThe ordinance was administered to them by myself andtwo more were baptized by Elder Clark. These weconfirmed and blessed four children and then started on 
 mind to Mr Adams than to any other man and hewas more capable of judging his views and feelings uponspiritual subjects. He informed me that his mind wasdeeply engaged with the faith of the Latter-day SaintsAt first my brother said but little about thesubject but before his death he warmly contended for the principlesand defended the cause of the Latter-day Saints when it wasassailed.Asahel was not himself during the last fewmonths of his life but was absent minded and overwhelmed indeep study and would be lost in thought for hours togetherHe lost his former cheerfulness and during those last monthshe spoke more frequently of his friends than before andespecially of myself. He was making preparations to go eastand was only hindered by his sickness and death.Mr Adams confirmed the statement thatmy brother's loss was much regreted by all of his acquaintancesand said that Asahel maintained that the cause of the Latter-day Saints was worthy of a thorough investigation andought to be carefully searched into.Sunday the 25 I visited my brother'sgrave wrote two letters one to my Sister Eunice. I wassick and had a very restless night.On the 29th we passed through Indian-apolis. This was a gloomy day to us both in body andsoul. The enemy made a powerful attack upon thelife of Elder John Taylor. He fainted several times andit seemed that he would die. We were obliged to stopand tarried for a few house ^hours^ at a house by the way sideWe then took brother Taylor in the wagon and drove tobrother Eldridge's and spent the remainder of the day innursing Elder Taylor.Father Coltrin exchanged horses with ElderEldridge and we continued on our journey 40 miles thenext day over rough road. We were terribly shaken inour weak state.The day following we travelled to German-town where we were obliged to stop in consequence of brother 
 On the 6th rode Parson Baity a preacher of the Christian order. Hereceived us kindly and in warm friendship as disciples of Christ. ElderClapp and myself retired aside the abodes of men and prayedunto the Lord to bless Parson Baity and his household and wecovenanted together not to leave his house until he became aLatter-day Saint. We returned to his house, preached the Gospelto him and he received it gladly. On the next day we aroseand baptised him and then went on our way rejoicing.The 19th was a day interesting and long to be remem-bered in consequence of the prospect of the fulfilment of the wordsof the ancient Prophets who testify of the great events of the lastdays especially the gathering of Israel.The time had now arrived when some of the Saints of Godin the South began to take their families their carriages wagonsoxen horses tents arms &c and move towards Zion as the childrenof Israel according to commandment.After breakfast on the 19th of September we reparedto the bank of a stream and prayer having been offered upto God President Marsh led a young man into the watersof baptism and he was confirmed upon the bankThe ceremony concluded we took the parting handof those beloved servants of God who with sister Patten set offtowards Zion to be followed by others on the same daywith ox teams.After spending a short time in arranging thewagons and teams the company was prepared to move forwardIt consisted of four families; including three Elders in thecamp. The families were these: Lewis Clapp and familyJohn Camp and family Albert Petty and family and ElderBenjamin Clapp and family; also Elders Boydstun andCathcart. The company chose Elder Boydstun as theirleader in their journey Zionward.The company consisted of males 6 females 5, children 10and one servant making in all twenty-two. They were principallythe first fruits of my ministry.After bidding adiu to their friends they movedforward on their journey in good spirits and with joy I rodewith them on their first day's travel as far as the Southforkof Mayfield w[h]ere we camped for the night.When we had pitched our tents and taken supper 
 journey to attend the Manchester conferenceI never before had left a field of labour with as muchsatisfaction and I felt to render up unto God the gratitudeof my heart for giving me so many souls as seals to myministry and I noted in my journal of that day the remarkablefact that I had been led by the Spirit (a little over a quarterof a year before) through a densely populated country foreighty miles and chose no part of it for my field of labouruntil I was led by the Lord to the house of John Benbowat Froom's Hill where I preached for the first time on the5th of March. Now on the 22nd of June I was journingto the Manchester conference where will be representedthis fruitful field of my labours with thirty three organizedchurches numbering five hundred and forty one membersthree hundred of whom received the ordinance of baptismunder my own handsElder Brigham Young laboured withme in this vineyard about one month from whom I andthe Saints received much benefit for he is mightyin council and endowed with much wisdom.Willard Richards had laboured with me two monthsand was also a great blessing to us for he hadpassed through a great school of experience and learntmuch wisdom and his sound judgement was very manifestin the councils and conferences in which we hadsat together.We walked to Ledbury that afternoona distance of eight miles where we spent the night andbaptized one.The next day Elder Willard Richardsand myself took coach to Worcester and thence toBirmingham. This is the first time I hadvisited this great manufacturing town. Birminghamis the centre of England in its location.Here Elder Richards and I partedHe took train for Manchester and I the coach forWest Bromich and called at sister Mary Packardwho informed me that Elder Turley was in another 
 Taylor's sickness. He suffered much and ba billious fever set in uponhim. I also felt quite ill myself. This was an afflicting day to usThe next day was the first of September and SundayElder Taylor felt much better and we concluded to spend the dayin the place and preach to the people. It was a Germansettlement. I delivered a discourse on the first principlesof the Gospel and other subjects. Brother Taylor followed andspoke until he was quite exhausted not realizing his bodilyweakness. I became chilled myself and we returned to theinn where we stoped when I was immediately taken withthe ague followed with high fever which lasted most of thenight.The next day Elder Taylor was worse and had ahigh bilious fever and could not continue his journey. It wasnow evident that brother Taylor would have to be left behindIt was painful to think of parting from him and to leavehim sick nor should I have done so had I been able totake care of him myself but this my health would not permitElder Taylor advised me to continue myjourney with Father Coltrin and make the best of my wayto New York and I accordingly concluded to take hisadvise.After committing my companion in theministry into the hands of God I parted from him inGermantown Wayne Co. Indianna leaving him in the handsof our Divine Master on whose work we were and inthe care of a kind and benevolent family who promisedto do everything in their power to make him comfortableuntil his recovery of which I had full confidence andfaith that the friends who promised to care for himwould keep their word.We started and rode to Richmond andout of the State of Indianna into the State of Ohio andpassed through the town of Eaton on our way where mywife suffered with the brain fever last winter as wejourneyed west. I noted the house in particular whereMrs. Woodruff was healed by faith and the power ofGod. We travelled this day 45 miles. 
 I assembled this small camp of Israel at Brother Petty's tent to addressthem for the last time in the South. When they were gathered together Iarrose to speak to them upon the subject of their jo^u^rney. The rain wasdescending in torrents so that we were soon wet through even withina good tent. Yet my soul was full of emotion and inspired with feelingsof no ordinary character. I endeavored to lay before them the worthand value of the cause in which they were engaged and that they were thefirst in fulfilling the Prophets who spake of the South keeping not backand that it would be recorded in the archieves of heaven to be read inthe day of eternity that they were the first fruits of the South whospread their tents for Zion. I also gave them some practical counselin relation to their journey. I was followed by Elders Boydston Cathcartand Clapp who spake in the Spirit of God with feelings of the deepestinterest. During the meeting the company covenanted to give heedto him whom they had chosed as their leader. We closed by ourkneeling when I supplicated a throne of grace and implored themercy of God to rest upon the camp and that they might allreach Zion in peaceIn the morning we arose and found all well notwithstandingthe severity of the night. I breakfasted at brother Petty's tent and then took the parting hand of these beloved Saints until I should meetthem soon in Zion. "May the God of Israel attend them forever" was the language of my heart at the time.October the 24th I started with Elder Smoot and PriestTurpin bound for Kirtland and travelled 25 miles to Paduche.On the following day I went for the first time in my life on boarda steam boat to continue my jo^u^rney.The interval from October 23rd to November 25th was filledup with our jo^u^rney Zionward. During this time we held meetingscalled upon the friends and relatives of brother SmootWe reached Chardon on the 24 and providentially met ElderHenry Sherwood on his way to Tennessee. We had a pleasent interviewwith him. I wrote a letter to send to the Saints where I had beenlaboring and amongst whom Elder Sherwood was going to labor in theministry.On the morrow we took the hand and parted from ElderSherwood and then I set out in company with Elder Smooth in ahard snow storm for Kirtland. 
 part of the town and had commenced baptizing in that place. Sheaccompanied me to brother John Robinson's Gritts Green near Bromwich whenI learned that Elder Turley had gone to Birmingham. I wrote tohim to return and see meI had not been in the house but a short timebefore two men came in full of wrath and brought a little blindgirl and demanded of me to heal her and work a miracle that they might have a sign. After telling them the character of those whosought for signs one of them brought a railing accusation againstme and rejected my testimony. Brother Turley had been preachingat this place for three weeks and had baptized nine persons. Duringthe evening several came to inquire into the work and four offeredthemselves for baptism. I spent the night at George Morrall'sNest day I met Elder Turley and was happyto see him. He read a letter to me which he had receivedfrom his wife containing much interesting matter to me. He informed me among other items that Elders Orson Hyde andJohn E. Page were set apart at the general conference by the ProphetJoseph on the 6th of April to go to Jereusalem and that they wouldvisit England on their way. The letter from Sister Turleyalso stated that sister Woodruff was at the conference and wasin good health. I preached that night at the house of Bro. Walker and four were baptized by Elder Turley.The day following was also spent atWest Bromich and preached in the evening when another wasbaptized and we ordained one priest and one teacherSo also was the 25 spent at the sameplace where I again preachedOn the 26weth we took the Omnibus toLane End at the Staffordshire Potteries via Wolverhampton and StaffordIt would be difficult to describe the scene between Birminghamand Wolverhampton. The whole county arround wassending up smoke and flames from its innumerable furnicesI thought I never saw anything which came so near the description of the lake of fire and brimstone as that sceneFor miles theat country is one universal mass of coal pitsiron mines and furnaces belching out fire and smokeAriving at Lane End we called upon 
 I will pass over the detail of my journeyuntil the 21st during which time I had parted fromFather Coltrin and on my way at Palmira I was nearthe place where the Book of Mormon was found. Thechills and fever had also followed me also during thispart of my journey.On the 21st of September I reached Farmington my birthplace. I was once more at myfather's house and had the privilege of meeting my parentsand my sister. Here I tarried for a short season andcontinued quite ill.On the 26th I rode with mother and auntBulah to uncle Adna Hart's whom we found sick and nighunto death and on the next day my grandmother Anna Thompsondied age 84 years.On the 3rd of October I baptized my cousinBetsey CossettMy uncle Adna died on the next dayThus my relatives were droping into eternity one after another.But thank God there is a power in the plan of salvationto redeem from the grave. I was baptized for my uncleAdna on the 26th of August 1844.Here I will observe a singular fact:Mercy Thompson Samuel Thomson and my grandfatherand grandmother Lot and Anna Thompson all of onefamily died at the age of 84 years.I was called upon by my relatives to attend the funeral of Uncle Adna which took place on the 5thI had suffered with the chills and fever almost daily forabout 15 days and to undertake to preach a sermon inmy weak state and at the very hour my ague usuallycame on required much resolution and faith. HoweverI promised to go and gave out the appointment. It wasa chilly day. I rode in company with my step-motherand sister Eunice to Avon three miles from Farmington.Arriving at the house of uncle Adnathe neighbours soon began to assemble and I had thepleasure of meeting many friends whom I had not seen 
 I will here extract from my Journal a full description of this dayand my feelings and impressions upon visiting and ^the^ city and Temple aswritten by me at that date.The Temple of the Lord came in sight (first in importanceto our view) before we reached Kirtland. I truly rejoy^i^ced as theHouse of the Lord rose in the view as we drew near this stakeof Zion. It was the first time that I had seen the Templebuilt by the commandment of God in this generationWe soon entered the place and I spent one of the mostinteresting and happy days of my life. The day was occuppied inlooking around Kirtland visiting the Temple and calling on theElders and Presidents of the ChurchAfter a seperation of two years and a half I was muchrejoyiced to strike hands with the Prophet Joseph again and alsoof many others of the beloved ones engaged in rolling on themighty work of God and of Israel. Among the rest I hadthe privilege of again meeting with Elder Warren Parrish andbecoming acquainted with his companion and wife. This gaveme much pleasure; for there is a joy in meeting our brethrenand companions in tribulations that the world knows not ofbecause it flows from a celestial source.I spent a short time in conversing with my friendsand then a more important scene opened to my view than everkings saw in this generation. It was that of the Temple ofIsrael's God. Our visit to that holy house was to us thecrow[n]ing event of the day. I was accompanied by brothersSmoot and Parrish. Each appartment of the Temple wasvisited in turn. When we crossed the thresho[l]d of the houseand passed into the lower room great solemnity amounting almostto a feeling of awe came over me for I felt indeed that mymy footsteps were in the Temple of the Lord of Host^s^.Having walked into the pulpits errected for the Priesthoodsand viewed the curtains we asscended into the upper rooms. Andas we passed from view to view scenes met our eyes showingthe grandeur solemnity and order that nothing short of wisdomfrom God could designIn the upper rooms we saw four Egyptian mumiesand the Book of ##Abraham|Abraham## written by his own[rest of page blank] 
 for a long time.After singing and prayer I arose at the samehour that my ague came on usually and addressed the assemblyI spoke for an hour or more in preaching the funeral sermonof uncle Adna.I took a last look at the corps which wasvery pleasent and it was conveyed to the graveyard wheremy mother grandfather and many relatives were buried.I did not go to the grave myself but afterconversing with two of my relatives upon the things of the KingdomI returned to Farmington very thankful that I had beendelivered from the ague this day notwithstanding that I hadbeen so exposed; nor did I have it any more for manydaysI left my Father's house and continuedmy journey on the 7th of October and arrived at New Yorkon the 19th. ^9th^Elder Parley P. Pratt arrived on the 24with his family and several more of the Twelve were expectedto be in New York soon.November the 1st I accompanied Elders ClarkWright and Mullenar on board the packet ship TarolintaCapt. Smith bound for LiverpoolI had expected to go with these brethrenbut thought it wisdom to tarry until more of the quorum ofthe Twelve arrived so that we might hold a Conferencein New York before we started for EnglandSoon after this I saw in a dreamMrs Woodruff in deep afliction at Montrose but I did not seeour child. This was in reality the case of my wife.Elder Orson Pratt arrived in New YorkNov 19th ^13^ and on the 19th we held a Conference in thiscity.On the eveni ^night^ of the 28th I had anotherdream of my wife. I saw her and notwithstanding thatwe rejoiced much at meeting each other yet our joy wasmixed with sorrow for after conversing awhile abouther domestic affairs I asked where Sarah Emma was 
 [top of page blank]In the upper story school room and belfry I was privileged with manyother interesting sights. Everywhere as we viewed appartment after appartmentof the house of God we saw Divine wisdom and high archetectural designand skill revealled.We then spent some time in visiting the Bank and PrintingOffice. It appeared that wonder upon wonder was opening beforeme as these scenes in Zion became revealed and laid before my eyes asthe beginning of the great work of Israel's God in the last days. I thought,"Well has the Prophet exclaimed, "He does things we look not for". [##Isaiah 64:3##]Two years and a half had elapsed since I left Kirtland withmy brethren in poverty to go up to visit our brethren in tribulationin Zion. The Saints at Kirtland were then poor despised and lookedupon by the pomp of Babylon with disdain and people with eagereyes wanted to behold them sink into forgetfulness. But whata change has come? Now I  behold a cheerfulness beaming uponevery countenance and the scenes around indicated prosperity. Thenoise of the ax^e^ and the hammer and their bank and market andespecially the House of God speak in language loud as thunder that theSaints will have a city in spite of all the false prophets of Baal andin spite of even earth and hell combined because God is with themand His Temple stands in honor of his kingdom while Babylon beginsto wonder and she will soon perish."I have given this extract from my Jo^u^rnal withscarcely any alteration. I desire my history as it proceeds as faras possible to represent myself at the different stages of my life andit must be understood that this work is simply a translation ofmy dirary into narative form and that more thatn three partsthereof are the words and sentiments written (much of it) thirty years ago.Sunday Nov 27 Elder Smoot and myself accompaniedElder Parrish to the House of the Lord for the purpose of worshipingand for the first time to behold a congregation of the Saints assembledwithin its walls. It was truly an interesting scene and broughtto my my mind much of the experience of my youth whichseemed a fulfilment of promises of the Lord made to me years agoand to which I had been looking forwardAfter entering the house and seating myelf I cast

 she answered weeping "She is dead." She also said thatshe had not received my letters.This dream was a token of what wasto come for my daughter died on the 17th of the nextJuly while I was in England.On the 13th of December I wrote tomy wife and sent her 5 dollars. On this day I againmet in Conference at 7 o'clock at Elder Pratt's. John Taylorhad just arrived in New YorkAfter passing through a severe fit ofsickness brother Taylor was enabled to continue hisjourney. All the Twelve had a sick hard time ingetting along on their mission this seasonOn the 17th I attended a meetingat the house of brother Niyzbot and we had a spiritualtime andA Prophecy of Parley P. PrattUpon the English MissionParley prophesied that the history of this hmissionof the Twelve should be known unto all nations. Thisat that time none could have seen only by the Spirit ofProphecy.December the 19th the packet shipOxford moved out into the stream with us on boardShe had 64 steaerage passengers and 15 cabin passengers.The ship was under the command of Capt John RathboneThere was in all on board 109 souls.The last day of the year found usIn the Middle of the AlanticThe sea was very rough and the weather cloudyand we sailed under close reefed topsails. We wereone thousand nine hundred miles from New YorkI will close this chapter with my 
 my eyes around upon the pulpits arranged in order for the HighPriests. I beheld the Patriarch Joseph Smith sen standing inthe upper pulpit and the Prophet Joseph and Elder Carterin the second one. In the third Elders Parley Pratt, Orson Pratt and Warren Parrish were seated. Soon Elder Carterarose and opened the meeting and then preached andthen came a discourse from the Prophet Joseph.In the afternoon I was called into the Standin company with Elder Smoot. I commenced byprayer and then opened the Bible at random at the##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah##.As there is something remarkable connectedwith my turning to this chapter which seems to bemore than mere chance I will here give a page of reminiscences of an earlier period of my life and beforeI heard the Gospel. Indeed this I did on the occasionof my first preaching in the House of the Lord on thissame afternoon of the Sa^b^bath of which I am writingThis page of reminiscences which I then related to thecongregation and which I shall here write was calledforth by the chapter in question and the scene before allof which I looked upon as fulfilment of Divine promisesmade to me by the Spirit years prior to this date.In the earlier part of my life my mind hadbeen much exercised for several years concerning thetrue Church and Kingdom of God for I did not beleivethat it existed in its true organization upon the earthThe growth of such ideas in my mind was doubtlessstrengthened much and more or less ingendered there by theteachings of an old Prophet by name Mason of whomI have spoken in [blank]At the time to which I refer I had pled muchwith the Lord in secret to lead me right. In the year1830 I tended a flower mill in New Hartford Ct. and duringthis year there were great revivals in that town. The churchof Pres [blank] held protracted meetings ranging from three totwenty daily ^days^. I attended some of them and had the privilegeof speaking my feelings to the people. They seemed frequently

He was bound for South Australia to preach theGospel to that distant colony sisxteen thousand miles from hisnative land.July th 7th I met with the Twelve and a numberof the Priesthood beside in council at the Millinnial Star officewehern much important business was transacted and a fieldof labour assigned to each officer until the next GeneralConference.After dinner the Twelve met by appointmentin front of the Infirmary and proceeded to a Paper storehousewhere Brigham and Parley had made a contract for paper suficientto print five thousand copies of the Book of Mormon. Afterseeing the paper weighed and prayed for (cost £107) we walkedto Brother [Miller] where I took refreshments with about 20 Eldersand had a pleasant time. The Twelve then went to the Star officeand held a council when it was voted that Parley mightgo to New York and get his family and that Elder TheadoreTurley should lead a company of Saints from England to Commerce (or Nauvoo) After some other business the meetingadjourned to meet the next morning.I wrote a letter to Phebe next day andon the following one for publication in the Millinnial Starand on the day after a number of letters to my friends andfamily in America to be forwared by Brother Parley to NewYork and on the next I assisted brother Brigham and severalof the sisters in doing up a package of No 3 of the MillennialStar for Parley to take to New YorkOn the 12th I attended meeting at the JoinersHall. Brigham preached in the morning and I in the eveningand in the afternoon we commenced with the SaintsNext day I received a lengthy and avery interesting letter from my wife Phebe from whichI made some extracts to be inserted in Millinnial StarNo. 4. My wife informed me that the Rev Mr Bogarta Methodist Preacher who was theThe Leader of the Missouri Mobhad Shot a Man during the Election 
 SYNOPSIS OF THE YEAR.Travels.I travelled in ten of the United States and crossedone half of the AtlanticConferences.I attended seven Conferences and held thirty fourmeetings and was in eight councils withtheFirst Presidency and Twelve.I recorded in this year's Journal oneDiscourse of the Prophet Joseph to the Twelve.Miscellaneous.I ordained three Elders and one Priest attendedthe baptism of a number of persons but did not baptizemore than one. I administered to sixteen sick persons andsome were healed wrote 35 letters and received six andprocured ten subscribers for the Messenger and AdvocateI also confirmed one into the Church. 
 very zealous in their religion; but as soon as I advocated the importanceof earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the Saints and forthe organization of the Church upon the ancient pattern and when I farther contended for the gifts and graces of the Church as manifested inthe days of the Prophets and of Christ and his Apostles both priest andpeople would oppose me. Therefore I could not unite with themin Spirit nor feel at home in their meetingsIt was during this state of things that I went before theLord one evening and prayed till past the midnight hour. I pledwith him to show me what to do and asked him in substancethe following questions:"If the sects of the day are thy people O Lord and areby Thee acknowledged in their worship and ordinances why amI seperated from them in Spirit and feeling? and if they are notThy people why do they prosper?"Of course in my prayers and suplications of that nightthe questions which I have here tersely given was much lengthyand varied than written above. But they contain the burden ofmy petitions to the Lord at that time, to whom I talked inthe simplicity and straitforwardness of a child approaching hisfather.The Spirit answered and said unto me open theBible and it shall there be shown thee. This injunction I obeyedand opened at random apparantly though I beleive it was directedby the Spirit and read the ##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah##. There is nota Chapter in the whole Bible which affords a more remarkableand suitable answer to the prayers of that night. The chapter indicated that salvation was near and the righteousness of God about tobe revealed; and [blank][eight lines blank]I was satisfied with the answer to my prayer andbecame convinced that the Churchs of the day were not of heavenlyorigin and that they did not form the Church and Kingdom of God

Two Elders with their families had gone out on missionto the Indians.July the 15th I parted from Elder Brigham Youngand the Saints at Manchester and rode to Burslem where I againmet Elders George A Smith and Alfred Cordon. I brought withme 110 Stars for brother Cordon and for brother Kington forthe Herefordshire Saints 550 numbers and about 100 Hymn BooksNext day I visited Stoke and Lane Endwhere the Saints manifested much joy at seeing me again. Iwas presented with a small splendid china box as a presentfrom the Saints in Stoke upon Trent. That night I preachedat Hanly and baptized one.On the following day July 17th I wrote twoletters to Phebe to be sent in a letter. I afterwards found thatmy first born childSarah Emma Woodruff Died on this Day.Next day I wrote to Elder Turley and a letter to the Saintsfrom Fox Islands at Montrose and then walked to Leek incompany of Elder George A Smith. This is the metropolisof the Morelands. There is a large stone crinoss in the church yarderected many centuries ago in hosnour of some RomanCatholic dignitaries. In 1645 the rebels of Scotland broke off the head and built a fire around it and the smoke still remains.The 19th being Sunday I preached at Leekwhen Mr John Jones came to oppose us. His carriagebroke down on the road and he was thrown into the mudHe came to our meeting but the Lord shut his mouthand he could not utter a word but left the room as soonas I had closed. In the even George A Smith preached andafterwards six were baptized under his hands. We alsoordained 2 and several were healed by our administration

Startingof the Millennial Star and Hymn Book.On the 11th of January 1840 the city ofLiverpool appeared in sight and soon after a steamtug came along side and towed us in. Arrivingin Liverpool we visited several of its most noted placesthat day. During the evening I wrote three letters oneto P. P. Pratt one to my brother-in-law and one to mywife.We spent Sunday the day following ourarrival in visiting several of the churches of Liverpool.The next morning after breakfast we wenton board the Oxford to get our trunks. The porter tookour trunks and boxes to Mr George Cannon's NorfolkStreet. He was a brother-in-law of Elder John TaylorOur provision chest and a box containingour bed and beding we left with him and then tookour trunks to the railway depôt and started per rail forPreston Lancashire.For the first mile we were under groungin a tunnel cut out of a solid rock with buildings andpeople over our heads.We started from Liverpool about 6 o'clockand arrived in Preston about 8 and called at the houseof brother Greenwood's.Elder Willard Richards was sent for 
 I was moreover assured that I should live to find the true Churchand that I should be gathered with the people of God and havea place and a name within the walls of His House.From that time I continued in this hope anddid not join any religious body until I heard the fulness of the Gospel and became a member of the Church of Latter-day Saints.I have now brought up my reminiscences tothat Sa^b^be^a^th afternoon when I was called into the Stand toaddress a congregation of Saints assembled in the Templeof the Lord. As I arose before the people to speak to themI again opened the Bible at random as on the night ofwhich I have been na^r^rating. This time as before I againopened to the ##Isaiah 56|LVI chapter of Isaiah## which was given to mein answer to my prayer in 1830.Directly all the scenes of that night werebrought fresh to my mind and I felt to rejoice beforethe Lord and his Saints that I had lived to see the fulfilmentof the promise of the Spirit to me seven years before.Having na^r^rated this incident to thecongregation I gave a sketch of my travels in the Southand was then followed by Elder Smoot. Bread and winewere then blessed as the sacrament of the Lord's supper andwe had the privilege of communing for the first time inthe Temple with Saints gathered to this Stake of Zion fromthe East and the West and the North and the South.A number of the Saints met in the House ofthe Lord December 1st to receive from under the handsof Father Joseph Smith their Patriarchal Blessings.I went up to the Temple to witness the scene and tohear the promises made to those Saints by the spiritof revelation and Prophecy. This was the first meetingof the kind I had ever attendedSunday the 4th President Rigdon called a voteto discontinue the use of liquors entirely in the Churchboth in sickness and health except for external washingand in the administeration of wine in the sacramentIt was carried unanimously.The next day in company with Elder SmootI commenced stud^y^ing the Lattein Gramma^r^ under the 
 On the 20th I did a bundle up with much painsto send to my wife by Elder Turley and the nesxt day GeorgeA. Smith and myself sent our packages to Manchester in care of Brigham Young. Afterwards we parted from theSaints at Burslem and took coach to Birmingham whereat night we attended the Seventeenth Anniversary of theBirmingham Auxiliary to the Baptist Missionary societyat the Town Hall. This is one of the principal publicbuildings in England and has the largest organ in that country perhaps the largest in the world. It is 52feet in height and contained 3000 pipes and 68 stops. The Hall could seat 5000 and it was c[r]owded. The chair wastaken at 6 o'clock and there were gathered there that eveningthe best ministerial talant in Europe.Next day we traveled by coach to Worcesterand thence to Ledbury where Elder Smith remainedbut I walked to Dymock and held a meeting that nightThe following day we walked to Froom's Hilland found the Saints strong in the faith and increasingfast in numbers and prepraring for emigration withthe Saints to the body of the church in America. Broand sister Benbow were willing to make every sacrificefor the gathering of the poor among God's people. A companyof about 50 were to start in a few days from theHerefordshire district 40 of whom would go by thegenerous help and philantrophy of Elder John BenbowAfter my return to my field of labourI continued my ministerial labours Elder George A. Smithbeing with me. I was happy to learn that the work inHerefordshire and adjoining country was rolling on rapidlyon every hand. The Elders and priests were universallyblessed in their ministry in this part of the vinyardThey were baptizing daily. Elder Richardson had baptizedabout 40 since his arrival and Elder Key about 20 and Elders Kington Browett Benbow Cheese Clark and others hadbaptized many.On the 2nd of July after my returnwe baptized 40 in various parts of this vinyard and 
 immediately upon our arrival and in a few minutes I hadbrother Willard by the hand.We went into the house and after spendingmost of the night in conversation we retired to restOn the 17th a council was held at the houseof Elder Richards. Elder Joseph Fielding was called to the chairAt this Council it was arranged that EldersJohn Taylor and Joseph Fielding ^should^ go to Liverpool Hyrum Clarkto Manchester and that Elders Wilford Woodruff and TheadoreTurley ^should^ go to the potteries and there enquire the mind of the Lordupon the importance of going to Birmingham. Willard Richardswas to have the privilege of moving where the Spirit directed andWilliam Clayton was given the charge of ^the^ affairs of the Church inManchester.It was directed also that the Elders shouldcommunicate to the Presidents of the Church in England & After thethe arrangement of some more matters and various principles explainedby those of the Twelve the council adjourned.During my stay in Preston we had manycalls every day to lay hands upon the sick and pray with themand in most cases they were healed.On the morning of the 18th we met at the house of ^Willard^ Richards' for a season of prayer and fasting to obtaina blessing before we seperated for our fields of labour. We hadan interesting timeWe gave each other our parting blessingsan then we seperated and started forOur Fields of LabourElders John Taylor and Fielding were bound for LiverpoolWillard Richards tarried for a season in Preston and Elders ClarkTurley and myself took the train for Manchester.Here I had the privilege of taking by the handElder William Clayton and many of the Saints of this place. BrotherClayton was one of the Presidents Council and a wise and worthyman.The Church in Manchester at this time numbered 
 instruction of Professor Haws.The Sunday following is worthy of note. The Lord throughhis Prophets and Apostles sharply rebuked this stake of Zion for oursins and backslidings and gave us timely warning that we mightescape the judgements of God else it should be with us as withthe camp of the Saints in their travels from Kirtland to ZionJackson County in 1834.A meeting was held on the 20th at the House of theLord for the purpose of organizing the Third Quoerum of theSenventies which had been chosen. I met with them but asthey were not all present the quorum was not fully organizedbut twenty seven were ordained as members of the Third Quorumamong whom was Abraham O. Smoot. This fulfiled whatI pronounced upon his head by the Spirit of Prophesy on the30th of June previous while in Tennessee.On the last day of the year I arranged a summaryof my Journal as usual for the year which I will give asbefore with my closing reflections for 1836.Synopsis of the Year.Travels and Meetings held:I traveled six thousand five hundred and fifty sevenmiles and held one hundred and fifty three meetingsConferences and Debates:I attended four Conferences among the Southern Churchesand held four debates.Baptisms Etc.I baptised and confirmed twenty seven souls and ordainedtwo Elders three Priests on^e^ Teacher and two Deacons. I also attended to the ordinance of blessing nineteen childrenand four persons were healed of disease under my handsby the power of God. 
 since the General Conference there had been baptized 250 in this regionThe churches here now numbered 800 members. I no longer continuedmyself to baptize but called the local and traveling ministry undermy direction to administer the ordinance of baptism while GeorgeA. Smith and myself devoted ourselves to preaching the gospelholding councils comfirming members healing the sick and blessingand building up the Saints. We were looking every day at this date for Elder Heber C. Kimball.As soon as brother Heber arrived it was ourpurpose to take our leave of the Saints in this region andgo with him toThe city of London on a missionto warn the inhabitants thereof and preach to them theGospel.On the 5th of this month I wrote a letter to theMillennial Star and on the next day I sealed up a packageof 42 letters and my Journal from Montrose to England to sendto my wife by Elder Turley. It contained all my correspondencesince the 8th of August 18239. Enclosed also was No 1 and 3 ofthe Millennial Star.It was one year on the 8th since I leftMontrose and parted from my family to take a missionto England and my history will show how the Twelve startedunder afflictions and pain how fever and ague followed uson our journey and it will show how also the Providenceof God afterwards was manifest and how wonderfully wehad been blessed in the British MissionAugust the 11th Elder Turley started forLiverpool to prepare a ship for about 80 Saints to emigrateand the fact that the man at whose ^house^ I first planted theseeds of the work in this part of the Lord's vineyard nowgathered at his own expence 40 of this 80 bound for the gatheringplace of the Saints. He gave one hundred pounds toElder Turley to pay the deposit money and secure the passageof those who were to go through his benevolence. Frommy soul I said "Let the blessing of Almighty Godrest upon brother John Benbow for ever" We tookthe parting hand of Brother and Sister Benbow and the 
 one hundred and sixty four souls.I had not been with Elder Clayton morethan a few minutes before I was called upon to visit threesick persons and administer to them.One case was very distressing. We foundthe sister possessed of the Devil and a burning fever on thebrain. She was raging and trying to tare herself to piecesalthough in the hands of three or four men.We laid hands upon the woman andcommanded the devil to depart and the fever to be rebukedin the name of Jesus Christ and it was done thoughnot without a great struggle. We left her sane andmostly delivered of her painsOn the Sunday I met with the Saints in Lo^mbard St^ Lower Mosby Street. Elder Turner^ley^ preachedin the fore part of the day. In the afternoon we brokebread together in Sacrament and in the evening I preached toa large congregationTwo offered themselves for baptism andwe laid hands upon twenty persons that were sick orafflicted and they were usually healed.At noon it was with difficulty thatwe could get out of the house for the press of the Saints wishingto shake hands with usThe Saints in England had greatconfidence in God and his servants and there were somany applying for the laying on of hands that it requiredon our parts great faith and much of the Spirit to answerto the faith in the people.On the 21st we parted from ElderClayton and the Saints in Manchester and took the coachand rode to Burslem in Staffordshire.The Saints in this place numbered 66including one Elder one Priest three Teachers and one Deacon.Elder Alfred Cordon presided over this Branch of the Church.The time passed on to the 29th whenElder Turley started for Birmingham. In the intervalwe had preached almost daily visited the Saints &c. 
 I established two preaching places procured twenty two subscribersfor the Messenger and Advocate and collected 70 dollars for itssupport. I gave six dollars and collected 85 more for thebuilding of the House of the Lord; wrote 34 letters andreceived seven and had three mobs come against me, butwas delivered from their hands:REFLECTIONS OF THE YEAR.(Copied from my Jornal of 1836.)"The year 1836 has gone into eternity with its report"of me and all mankind as the preceeding one went before"and as the next and all future ones must do. O^h^ Time!"How swift art thou! How great the events that are borne"upon thy wings especially in this the Dispensation of the"fulness of times."The year has gone and cannot be recalled; but"during its reign the endowment of the Latter-day Saints has"revealed a God in Israel and shown that though the heavens"and earth pass away the word of the Lord spoken through his"Prophets must all be fulfilled.And what of the coming year? The thoughts"of man may retrace his footsteps through 1836 just past; but"who can tell what the end of 1837 will leave him. Will not"its momentous developments and gigantic works be written in"the archieves of heaven as great events? And will this generation"at this late hour still sleep. If so; sleep on O Babylon and"take thy rest for thy end cometh; and the day has dawned"when Israel must be awoke from his slumber to prepare ^as a Bride^"him self for the Brid^e^groom for it is the midnight hour"of the world that fast approacheth."Then let 1837 finish its work with speed and"God grant that it may report that Zion and her stakes"reveals a God in her midst with power and glory"Thus ends the year 1836" 
 Saints at Froom's Hill who were going with him to meetthem no more until we meet again in Navoo. We thenwalked to LedburyNext day we went to Dymock and foundbrother Heber at brother Kington's. He had come fromManchester to meet Elder George A Smith and myselffor the purpose of going to the city of LondonBrother Heber brought with him twoletters just received from America one of which was fromhis wife to himself and the other from Father JohnSmith to his son George A.Sister Kimball informed us of the death of the Presiding Bishop Edward Patridge who diedMay the 27th 1840 and his daughter died a week beforehim. Bishop Patridge was one of the wisest andbest men of the last days. He was like Nathanielof old in whom there was no guile. [##John 1:47##] He had passedthrough much persecution with the Saints for theword of God and the testimony of Jesus. In 1833 hewas imprisoned and tared and feathered. In 1839 hewas again imprisoned and passed through the greatpersecutions of that year and he was a member and theBishop of the Church almost from its foundationElders Kimball Smith and myselfon this day walked to Turkey Hall in Glostershire wherewe preached and on the next day went to Leigh andheld a meeting with the Saints. We all three spoke andhad an interesting time. After meeting I baptized 4and assisted in the confirmation of seven.On the evening of the next day we helda council meeting at the house of Elder Browett. We had a very profitable time and after meeting confirmed oneand healed several who were sick. The following day wecontinued at Leigh.Sunday the 16th we held a large campwhen Brothers Kimball and myself preached to large congregationsboth in the forenoon and afternoon. We baptized [arbt] 4and confirmed 64 and also ordained 1 Elder and 2 Priests. These 
 On the 30th I visited each appartment of the silk factoryin New Castle and saw them manufacture silks from the raw materialto the weaver's loom.A week after I visited Copeland's pottery works and foundit a great curiosity. Brother John Rowley made me a present of a chinabox in token of friendship with the following inscription upon it inletters of gold:Willford & Phebe WoodruffA Present fromStoke upon Trent, England,1840.He also presented me with three small bottles with thenames incribed on them of Phebe Sarah Emma & Eunice;also three china pitchers inscribed withWillford Woodruff, Phebe WoodruffSarah Emma WoodruffOn the 10th of Feb Queen Victoria of England was marriedto Prince Albert. As many on this day were celebrating the marriageof the Queen I thought it right to honor the king of heaven by advocatinghis cause and preaching the Gospel of his son Jesus Christ.I walked into the market place accompaniedby Elder Alfred Cordon and two other brethren and we began to singand pray unto God and call upon his name.A congregation flocked around us and wepreached unto them and I bore testimony of the great work which Godhad set his hand to accomplish and of the Second Coming of Christand warned the people to repent and be baptized for the remissionof sins.When we had finished our testimony wedismissed the people though many of them followed us. We alsopreached in the evening at a brother's house and baptized one.I received a letter from Elder John Taylor inwhich I was informed that they had baptized ten in the townof Liverpool.The next night I preached at Burslem and afterthe meeting a female came to be baptized. We called upon hersister as we passed along and she said she would obey the

May my life health and strength be precious in Thy sightthroughout the year just begun. Wilt Thou save me by Thygrace from all sin and the powers of temptation which try thesouls of men? Wilt thou give me favor during the year withGod and his Saints? Wilt Thou bless me while in school andin meeting with the quorums of Seventies and while attending allother meetings for Divine worship?"O Lord if it by thy will give me the privilege of recordingin this year's Journal Great blessings pronounced upon my headfrom mine an^n^ointing and under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph and also an account of visions and revelations of Jesus Christ that Imight be a special witness of Thee O Lord. If I am called to preachthe Gospel this year may I be blessed with souls for my hire. If Ivisit my kinsmen wilt thou make me an instrument of bringingthem into thy celestial Kingdom. And I covenant with TheeO Lord to go and come at Thy bidding. I ask these blessingsthrough the Priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen."At early candle light on the evening of January the 3rdin company of ^with^ Elder Milton Holmes I repared to the House of the Lordfor the purpose of meeting with the Seventies. About twenty wereordained as members of the Third quorum under the hands of Presidents

We passed by three villages and thousands ofacres of wheat and barley fields in the season of harvest.Part of the crops were cut and part standing and thecountry arround everywhere wore the golden hue ofplentiful harvest.We passed through Oxfordshire andwithin about eight miles of the Oxford University. Thisis the largest and most famed University in the worldJourning through Oxfordshire we saw vastherds of cattle sheep and deer. We passed insight ofStow the family residence of the Duke of Buckinghamand the Wychwood Forest containing seven thousandfive hundred acres of timber in which thousands of 
 Gospel also. We then called upon another woman who wasbelieving but she made objections to being baptized then becauseshe had a dead child in the house. I told her to letthe dead burry the dead and to arise and follow usThe woman followed and we walkedtwo miles and I baptized the three females. Their husbandswere in the Church and were present at the baptism oftheir wives.We visited Stok^n^e on the 17th for thepurpose of getting a door open for the preaching of the GospelAn house was obtained and I preached to a small congregationin the eveningThe next day we left Stone and walkedto Stoke. On our way we paidA VisittoThe Duke of Sutherland's Park.It is about five miles in length and fivein bredth. The first thing of note that struck our attentionas we came on the road from Stone to Stoke was the estateof several hundred acres of ground planted over with young^timber^ sprouts. This land was hilly.Next came spring vale. The lower fountainis a forced vein throwing a stream of water twelve feet highThere is a fish pond above the first fountain but rathersmall. On the hill above is a spendid stone house forthe purpose of keeping persons who might be insane. Aroundthis vale are a number of small monuments.Then came into our view the Manor Housebuilt of stone. This was mostly in ruins and was more thanfive hundred years old. One family had lived in it for morethan three hundred years descending from father to son.We next visited the spendid monumenterrected in memory of George Granville the late Duke and father of the present Duke of Sutherland.This monument is built of hewn stone 
 Coltrin and Aldrich. After these were ordained Elder M. Holmsand myself were called upon by the Presidents to come forward andbe ordained as members of the first Seventy Elders of Israel tobear the name of Jesus to the nations of the earth. The firstSeventy was chosen out of the camp that went up to Zion in1834 for the redemption of Zion; but as we were not presentat the time we were afterward ordained into the Second QuorumThere being however two vacancies in the first now we werechosen to fill those vacancies. President Aldrich ordainedElder Holmes and President Z. Coltrin ordained me. Greatblessings were pronounced upon our heads by the spirit of revelationOn the 6th I visited the office of the KirtlandSafety Society and saw the first money issued by the society'sTreasurer. It was given to brother Bump (in exchangefor other notes) who was the first to circulate it. I alsoheard President Joseph Smith declare in the presence ofF Williams D. Whitmer S. Smith and others that he hadreceived that morning the word of the Lord upon the subjectof the Kirtland Safety Society. He was alone in a roomby himself and he not only heard the voice of the Spiritbut it was also an audible voiceMeetings spiritual seasons and daily duties filled upto Jan 23 when it was found necessary for Elder Smoot to returnto his home in the South on account of ill health. On thisday he received his Patriarchal blessing before leaving on the25th for his home. I officiated as scribe in writing hisblessing from the mouth of the Patriarch Joseph. I gavebrother Smoot a copy of it in print.We were threatened with a mob to visit us onthe 24th from Panesville to demolish our Bank and take ourproperty but they did not come as threatened. The wrath ofour enemies however was kindling against us in this part andseemed to the watchful the scourge awaiting the people of ZionFeb 19th I went up to the House of the Lord andheard the Prophet Joseph address the people for several hoursHe had been absent from Kirtland on business for the Churchthough not half as long as Moses was in the Mount [##Exodus 24:18##] yet manywere stirred up in their hearts and some were against himas the Israelites were against Moses; but when he arosein the power of God in the midst of them they were put

It is also a noted resort for the Sportsmen and the huntAt Farington Station we took the train forLondon at 1 o'clock p.m. We passed through Relicks and had a good view of the old ruins and as we dashed along in thecars we had also a fine view of the splendid Wcastle. After travelling on the rail 70 miles we reachedthe great metropolis of England.The City of Londonat 4 o'clock p.m.We took conveyance to the centre of the cityby omnibus, and then walked across London Bridge intothe Borough, and called upon Mrs Allgood, 19 King Street,in the City. She is the sister of Elder Theadore Turley'swife. She treated us with kindness, and gave usrefreshments and then directed us to a public house, the King's Arms, King Street, Borough. Here we tarriedfor the night. and I wrote a letter to my wife.We were now in England's great metropolisto sound to it the first proclamation of the Latter-DayWork; forHeber C. Kimball, George A Smith, and Myselfwere the Theree First Elders in Londonto preach the Gospel and establish the Church of Latter-Day Saints.I wrote another letter to my wife nextday to be forwarded by Elder Turley. We then took a walka mile or two into the city, passed London Bridge twiceand returned and spent the night at the King's Arms.There was so much passing in the street of drays and cabsand singing and hallowing at all hours of the night thatit was with difficulty I could sleep at allI wrote a letter to Elders Young andRichards next day and also another to Bro F Pullin andthen we took a walk through the city. We calledupon the Rev. J. E. Smith Lincoln's Inn Fields, andalso visited John Pye 16 Curiosity Street Chancery Lane. 
 and stands upon a hill. The monument was about eighty feet highThe Duke was of course a member of the BritishParliament and as an emblem of his legislative character he held inhis ^left^ hand a roll of paper. He stands facing his splendid mansion whichis an expensive and majestic building in the vale north of the monumentat which a person has a fine view of it.The house covers 4 acres and is built of hewnstone having much carved work of lions and other images. There were365 windows in it before the repairs and additions which the presentDuke was making which it was supposed would take seven yearsto accomplish.There were some hundreds of acres of woodlandon the estate and farm patches all of which were enclosed witha fence of 4 or 5 feet high. The whole of the fence was composedof solid iron railing miles in length.In this park the Duke had vast quantiesof game fish and fowl. The deer was as tame as sheep. Wesaw about 300 of them in one drove.The river Trent runs through the Parkand the Duke has converted the whole of it for some distanceinto a fish pond.I visit the burrying ground which wascovered with many kinds of evergreen.The public road running through the Parkis between two stone walls about 10 feet thick and from fourto six feet high covered with turf and green grass.The Duke of Sutherland has two otherParks as valuable as the one we visited and his wealth wascomparatively inexhaustible and beyond his own knowledge.My Birthday, March 1st.On this day I was thirty three years of ageOn this birthday I preached in ^Hanly^ and broke bread andin the evening I preached again to a large congregation whenthe Spirit and power of God rested upon me. Four offeredthemselves for baptism and others received my testimonywhom I expected would be baptized. 
 to silence for the murmerers saw that he stood in the power of aProphet of the Lord God.The next month was principally spent in my attending schooland some interesting meetings and preparing myself for my endowmentswhich I was soon to have the privilege of receiving in the Temple of theLord with many others.On March 23rd I went up to the House of the Lord at anearly hour in the morning to spend the day in prayer and fastingwith the Saints in Kirtland as this was a day set apart for thatpurpose. Immediately after en^t^ering the House in company^with^ of several other Elders I went within the veil and we bowedbefore the Lord in the Aronic Stand and offerred up our morning sacrifice. The Spirit rested upon us with joy to our souls.I was then called upon by Father Joseph to reada chapter in the Book of Mormon and I read a chapter from theBook of ##Jacob 5|Jacob## which contains the parable of the tame olive treelikened unto the house of Israel as was spoken by the ProphetZenos. The same God that touched Isaiah's lips with hallowed^fire^ gave Zenos great wisdom in setting forth this parable.When I had made some brief remarks upon thesubject the congregation took their seats for the service of theday in the following order:The house being divided into four parts by veils thefemales occupied two parts and the males the others. Some of thePresidency presided in each appartmentThe time was taken up during the day in singingexhortation and prayer. Some had a tongue others an interpretation and all was done in order. The power of God rested upon thecongregation. Upon some the gifts were poured out while othershad the administration of angles and the image of God sat uponthe countenances of the Saints.At four o'clock in the afternoon the veils were all rolledup together which brought the whole congregation in full view ofeach other and while the presence of the Lord filled the house thecongregation of Saints fell upon their knees and all as with one accordvocally poured forth rejoicing supplication and prayer before the God ofIsrael. This closed the service of the day after contributing forthe support of the poor.Sunday March 26 in the latter part of the day ElderWarren Parrish preached the funeral sermon of sister Pratt the 
 He was a strong beleiver in the prophecies of Joanna Southcott andwas one of the society. We then returned and had a viewof St. Pauls cathedral, the largest in the world exceptSt Peter's at Rome. We crossed London Bridge tooktea at 19 King Street, and then went to Union chapel,Waterloo Road, and heard a comical sermon deliveredby an Atkinite preacher. I spent the night at 58 KingStreet at Mrs Loftus.The next day August the 21st was themost interesting sight seeing day in my life, as far as theviewing the splendid works of manI started in company of Elders HeberC Kimball and George A Smith for a walk over thecity of London. We crossed London Bridge, and passedthrough King William Street, and several other streets, and visited Covent Garden, then through St Martin Street and Court, LeicesterSquare, Sidney Alley, Coventry Street, Picadillie, Glass Hous stand through most of Regent Street, The latter is one of themost splendid streets in the world. We passed throughLangham Place, and All Souls Church, which has a spire nakedfrom its base to the top, then through Oxford Street, andreturned by way of St Paul's, and ended our sight seing ofthe day by visiting the noted monument erected in commemoration of the great fire in London, in 1666, and built underthe direction of that famous Architect, Sir Cristopher Wren.We entered a door at its base (paid 6 pence on entering) andascended 345 black marble steps which brought us up 200feet into the air and about 100 feet higher than the highesthouses. We steped on the outside of the pillar, which issurrounded by an iron railing; and here we had presentedto our view an indescribable scenery on every handof one of fthe greatest capital cities of the world, & which can boastof a history of nearly two thousand years. At our feet, as it were laid a historical panorama stretching out to ourview arround. Never before had I beheld such a splendidsight never before such a grouping of the monuments ofancient times never before beheld such a grand historicalillustration of London as it was through the long succession of 
 About this time commencedA Great Work in the Potteries & ^County of^ Herfordshire.^through my labours^which resulted in the baptism of hundreds and the workflourished and grew and the fame thereof went abroadthroughout that region of countryOn the 4th we took coach to Worchester andthere walked to Mr John Benbow's Hill Farm Castle FroomeLedbury Herefordshire.Mr Benbow was a large farmer andcultivated about 300 acres of land. I spoke the word ofGod to him and his house and he received my testimonyand we had a good time. I spent the night at hishouse, and also the next day and preached there andhad the testimony that there was^ere^ many present that wouldbecome Saints.On the next day I preached again athis house in the evening when a number received theword and I baptized six. Mr John Benbow andhis wife were among the numbers. The other four werepreachers of the United Brethren of the Methodist Order.I spent the next day in preparing a pondto baptize in.The next day was Sunday when I preached in the morning at Frooms Hill in the afternoonat Standly Hill and in the evening at the Hill Farm.The Lord was with me and I baptized 7 persons 4of whom were preachers of the United Brethren. I alsoconfirmed 13 and broke bread with the Saints.Next day I preached again at StandlyHill and baptised 7 persons more 2 of whom were preachers,and one ^on^ the one following ^day^ I baptized 12 persons more, 3 ofwhom were preachers.I preached on the next three daysand the power of God was with me. On the thirdday after preaching at Stokes Lane I baptized three othersinto the Church. 
 wife of Elder P. P. Pratt one of the Twelve Apostles. Sister Pratt diedMarch 25 1837.On Monday, the following day I signed fifty dollars forthe building of the House of the Lord in Zion. The subscription listwas in the hands of Elder Elisha H. Grovesof Several subsequent days I spent in perusing the outlinesof ancient and modern history by the Rev. Royal Robbins. Thereflective mind is struck with deep sensibility in viewing therise & progress, and decline and fall of the nations and Kingdomsof the earth since the days of Adam. And it is equally importantand interesting to contemplate the day that has already begunin fulfilment of ancient prophecy when Israel shall be restoredthe Kingdom of God established upon the earth and thecovenants made by the Lord unto Abraham Isaac and Jacobrealized by their seed. As I read this book and reflected uponthose things I sensibily felt my calling from the Lord ashis servant to act my part in the fulfilment of his workand now as one of the first Seventies of Israel to become aspecial witness of Jesus Christ to the nationsApril the 13rd brought the day for the preparationsto be made for the solemn assembly and the anointing andendowment of the Elders of Israel. Those were now to receivetheir endowments who had not received them in the Spring of1836 and as I was absent at that time it fell to my lot toreceive this blessing with those who were to pass through theTemple for endowment at this time.I shall record the events of each day of the endowmentfor the benefit of the generations to come.On this 3rd day of April I met in the house of theLord with a number of the Seventies to received counselcil respectingour washings and anointings. I was appointed with ElderG. Meeks to visit President F. G. Williams and have the perfumesand oil prepared for the day following that we the Elders of Israelmight become the anointed ones of the Lord according to therevelations of Jesus Christ and as sung by the poet:"We'll wash and be washed and with oil be anointed"Withal not omitting the washing of feet"For he that receiveth his penny appointed"Must surely be clean at the harvest of wheat." 
 England's greatness by this magnificient view of London asit is in the present dayWe were situated so as to overlook nearly everypart of the city. East of us lay the ancient Tower of London; theplace of so many great historical episodes of English history, thescene of many of the capital tragedies of England and the terribleBastile of England the frowning political sepulcure of thenation where the absolute monarchs and great ruling chiefsof the land have buried their victims their secrets and theircrimes.East of us also lay the Mint; North the MansionHouse of the Lord Mayor of London; North West St Paul's churchWest- Westminster Abbey and the House of Parliament; Southlies the River Thames with five of the large bridges acrossin full view and one not seen from the mMonument makingsix: One of the collossal arched Bridges of the Thames isof solid cast iron called Southwark Bridge. This also is thecelebrated "Suspension Bridge" which at this time was oneof the great wonders of the age. The other collossal andmagnificent bridges of the royal Thames (England's chief river)are London Bridge Blackfriars Waterloo Westminster andVauschall all of which are built of massive stone. Thesesix bridges are fine sights in themselves. They are thearchitectural monuments of the Thames; and our view of themfrom our high pinnacle with their crowds of moving andeverchanging human masses, and to so describe it mobs ofcabs, omnibuses, carriages, drays, &c., which dash along and seenas though they were going to lock together and dash eachother to pieces presented to us a picturesque sight. worthyof note.In addition to all this within our viewwas London Borough, on the South of the River, and allaround us hundreds of churches, chaples and spires, standing in the midst of one universal mass of buildings, covering about six square miles of groundWhile viewing this prospect on a clearday, we conversed with a Prussian Traveller, a citizen of Berlin,who had travelled much over Europe and Asia and other parts 
 Sunday the 15th of March I preached at Froom'sHill and met with the Saints in the afternoon and confirmedtwenty two persons and ordained John Cheese to the office of Priest.In the evening I preached to a congregation ofabout eight hundred but some of the baser sort made muchdisturbance. There was a number of persons that wished tobe pbaptized but they had to return home without it inconsequence of the people.On the next day I walked to Mainstonand obtained a license for preaching in any place under theEnglish Government.On my return I visited a number of personsand found them beleiving. I preached at Froom's Hill andbaptized three personsThe day following I had an agreeableinterview with Mr Thomas Kington the Superintendent ofthe United Brethren. I laid the fulness of the Gospel beforehim and he received the testimony.On the 20th I baptized three persons oneof whom was a preacher. While preaching on this day some ofthe lower sort armed themselves with rotten eggs and threwthem at me. One hit me in the head but did not breakuntil it struck the groundThe next day I walked to Ledbury andfound a letter from Brother Richards. Afterwards returningto brother Benbow's I baptized four persons 2 of whom werepreachers: one was Thomas Kingston the Superintendant ofthe preachers of the United Brethren. I felt to exclaimGlory to God, this work rolls on!Sunday I preached at Hill Farm andin the evening confirmed 6 persons and ordained Thomas Kingtonto the office of an Elder and William Jinkins to the office ofPriest.The next day I received letters fromJohn Taylor Willard Richards and Alfred Cordon. Elder Taylorinformed me that he had baptized seventeen persons inLiverpool and Elder Richards' wished me to enquire ofthe Lord his will concerning ^brother^ and sister Richards for 
 After fulfiling the above appointment Elder Meeks Priest Turpin andmyself repared to a room to attend to our first washing. After clensingour bodies from head to foot with soap and water we then washed ourselvesin clean water and afterwards with perfumed spirits. The evening wasspent with several Elders in prayer before God and his power restedcopiously upon us.The next day I met at the house of Elder Hales at one o'clockin the afternoon in company of twenty-three Elders for the purpose ofattending to the ordinance of washing. President Joseph Young who was ofthe number opened the meeting by prayer and we then proceeded withthe ordinance. Myself and Elder G. W. Meeks were the first washedunder the hands of President Joseph Young and we then assisted himin washing our brethren the Elders. Much of the Holy Spirit restedupon us.At early candle light we again met together in thequorum of Seventies at the upper part of the Lord's house to receiveour anointing. The quorums of the Priests Teachers and Deaconsoccupied one appartment the Elders another and the Seventies a thirdEach quorum met for their anointingThree of the Presidents met with the Seventies—namely Joseph Young H. Aldrich and Z. Colultrin. After the meetingwas opened by prayer those who were to be anointed were suitablyaddressed and then the Presidency proceeded to the ordinance byfirst consecrating the oil. The person then presented for theanointing took a seat and the Presidency laid their hands uponhis head and pronounced such blessings upon him as the testimony of Jesus directed. We had truly a glorious season in this solemnordinance of the house of God. There were fifteen anointed inour quorum. President Coultrin anointed me and pronouncedupon my head great blessings which were sealed upon my head inthe name of Jesus Christ by a loud Amen from all presentThe meeting closed about 10 o'clock p.m. when I wentinto the lower court of the House of the Lord with Elders Joseph B.Nobles and G. W. Meeks to spend the night in prayer and fastingbefore God. Part of the night we had a severe trial of our faithby temptation from Satan but before day we obtained a good degreeof victory over him and the Lord poured out his spirit upon usand we felt it good to be in the House of our God when naturewas hushed in silence and the shades of night covered the earthIn the morning we returned to our homes intending to spend the 
 of the world, and he declaired that we could not find another spoton the face of the earth that would present to our view so granda scenery as the one before usThis mMonument on which we stood is 24feet higher than Trajans Pillar at Rome and on it is the following inscription in Latin:In the year 1666 the second day of Septemberfrom hence at the distance of 202 feet, the hight up this columnabout midnight a most terrible fire broke out which drivenon by a high wind not only wasted the adjacent parts butalso places very remote with incredible noise and fury.It consumed 89 churches the gates of the city, Guild Hallmany public structures hospitals schools libraries and a vastnumber of stately edifices 13,200 dwelling houses 400 streetsof 26 Wards it utterly destroyed 15 and left 8 others shatteredand half burnt. The ruins of the city were 436 acres:from the Tower by the Thames side to the Temple churchand from the North East Gate along the city wall to HolbornBridge. To the estates and fortunes of the citizens it was merciless but to their lives very favourable (only eightbeing lost) That it might in all things resemble thelast conflagration of the world the destruction was suddenfor in a small space of time the same city was set [a]most flourishing and reduced to nothing. The days after, When the fatal fire had baffled all human councils andendeavours, the opinion of all, as it were by the will ofheaven it stoped and on every side was extinguished.August 22nd I received a letter fromMrs Woodruff which gave me much joy and I wrote herin return. We also received one from Brigham Youngand a copy of the 4th No of the Millennial Star. I walkedout in the evening near the house of Parliament and boughta good pocket watch and paid £2.90Next day we went to Zion's chapel andheard the celebrated Rev Robert Aitken preach two sermonsHe delivered an interesting warning to the Gentiles, and presentedsome of the most sublime truths I ever heard from a sectarianpriest; but he was building without the foundation. 
 they were in deep affliction.On this day I preached at Standly Hill andbaptized twelve persons.A preacher called upon me On the onefollowing a preacher called upon me and after conversing withhim awhile he requested me to baptize him.I changed my clothing and as I gotready to go to the water three other preachers rode up ina carriage to see me.The fame had gone out into all the country around of the rapid work that God was doing amongstthe people. They had not heard me nor any Latter-day Saintpreach but had come more than 20 miles to see me.They came down out of the gig and walkedto where I was. Notwithstanding they were ministers I stood upand boldy testified of the work of God in these last days.The power of the Spirit rested upon me and they boweddown and prayed and gave glory unto God.We arose from our knees and the carriagestood still and we all went down into the water that samehour and I baptized them and afterwards laid my handsupon them that they might receive the Holy Ghost and theythen went on their way rejoicingAfterwards I went to ^Moorends Cross^ whereI preached and baptized five persons making nine during theday. I also wrote a letter and confirmed eight person.The next day I travelled and preachedas usual and at night I had a remarkable dream by which I feltcertain that there would be a great gathering of fish in the Gospeland that I should baptize many and some noted persons. I wasalso persuaded that more of our brethren was on their way fromAmerica.On the day following I baptized two moreone of whom was a preacher. I then walked to Shuknell Hill anoted and sightly place. The plains looked beautiful and thevalleys around the place ^town^ made the scenery picteresque inappearence. Notwithstanding that this was but a countryplace I counted twenty one churches from the top of the hill 
 day in fasting and prayer. Part of the day was occupied in attendingthe high council; the remainder until 5 oclock in writing prayer and fastingAt 5 o'clock I met in the House of the Lord with the Seventies fora solemn assembly anointing &c. Three out of the seven Presidentswere present and they anointed twelve. The Spirit of the Lordrested upon us and we were satisified and returned home.April the 6th was the great day of the Solemn AssemblyAs upon this day the Church was organized in 1830 the six of Aprilhas become a day specially set apart and as this an[niversary]of the organization of the Church was like the Pentecost atJerusalem [##Acts 2##] I shall somewhat fully record the proceedings of this timeAt 8 o'clock a.m. I went up to the House of theLord and spent an hour in the lower part. The Presidentsof the Church then called the quorums of the Seventies in theupper part of the house as there was some business to be attendedto before they could proceed with the order of the dayIn the first place six of the Presidents of theSeventies were taken from that position and transferredto the quorum of the travelling High Priests and six otherPresidents were chosen in their stead. I shall not give theparticulars of this change: suffice it to say that all of thecounsellors first chosen excepting Joseph Young were High Priestsbefore the organization of the Seventies and they had the rightto officiate in the lower offices of the ChurchThe six new Presidents chosen out of the Seventies totake the places of those who were to be transferred were [blank]After this matter was arranged there was a gloriousordinance performed upon the heads of those of the Elders whohad been anointed. While all the anointed present standinglifted their hands towards heaven the First Presidency ofthe Church confirmed and sealed upon our heads all the blessingsof our ordination anointing and Patriarchal with a seal in thepresence of God and the Lamb and his holy angels. This seal wasconfirmed with a shout from all the anointed with uplifted hands ofHosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna to God and the Lamb!Amen, Amen, and Amen!This was repeated three times and if ever a shout enteredthe portals of heaven this did and was echoed by the 
 On the 24th we removed our lodgings to Mr RobertMerryfields, No 15 Glousester Row, Grange Road, wehere we obtainedroom for all three of us.We visited St. Paul's Cathedral and went allthrough the lower court. Excepting St Peter's at Rome this is thelargest and most famed in the world.St Paul's is 500 feet long 20085 feet widefrom North to South 404 high from East to West andit contains 74 monuments of fine marble erected over thetoombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals and Earls and menof other titles who have distinguished themselves in the militaryservice of Great Britian and otherwise. Lord Nelson's Monument is the largest and most noted of the whole ofthe men thus honoured. Their bodies are placed in the vaults and their monuments erected on the flour aboveThis cathedral has three lofty spires and thewhole building is magnificient.St. Paul's church was first built by St Augustinein the year 610 and was destroyed by fire in 961 andrebuilt the following year. It was not until the reign ofAthelstan that London became the Metropolis of Englandand it was to this King that St Paul's was mostly indebtedfor its permanent establishment and pre-eminance. In 1086it was again destroyed by fire which also laid the greater partof the Metropolis in ruins. Maurice Bishop of London whohad been chaplain and Chancellor to William the Conqurer conceivedthe vast design of erecting the magnificient structure whichimmediately preceeded the present cathedral. In 1099 it wassufficiently built to admit of public worship but was again partlyburned in 1132 and again in 1135-6 and sustained considerableinjury. The central tower was completed in 1221 and additionswas made to the building from time to time. The lofty spireof the cathedral was fired by lightning in 1444 and not repairedtill 1462 and in 1561 it again caught on fire and the roofalso destroyed. Queen Elizabeth commenced to repair it andCharles the First completed it at the cost of 104330=4=8; butunder the rule of the Parliament and Cromwell the cathedralsuffered befyond any former example. Its revenues were 
 I preached in the evening to a large congregationand although it was the first time that they had heard the fulness ofthe Gospel yet if there had been water convenient there would havebeen twenty baptized but as it was a great distance to the water mostof them concluded to wait until another time.  Some however wouldnot take no for an answer and they followed me until 2 o'clockin the morning in search for waterWe finally found a stream and baptized fivepersons in a place where we had to let them down eight feet by abank before we reached the water. Three of these were preachers andone an old woman who had followed us the whole of the time leaningupon her staves.During the day ^and night^ I had baptized seven personsand on the next day I baptized two more one of whom was a Primitive^Methodist Preacher^The day following was one of much labour. Itwas Sunday the 29th. I preached at Frooms Hill at half past teno'clock at the Hill Farm at half past 2 and baptized thirteen intothe Church. In the evening I met with the Saints and confirmedthirty-five and broke bread with about eighty of the members ofthe ChurchI felt how much strength and wisdom I neededfor I was informed this day that some of the ministers of the Churchof England were holding councisels to petition Parliament to stop mypreaching and cause our religion to cease out of the land.The last ^30^ of March was the following daywhen I baptized and confirmed into the Church nine more soulsI walked to Ledbury and had not been in town an hour beforemany flocked around to see me and gave me the hand of fellowshipThe Baptist minister opened his chapel for meto preach in and he went into the pulpit with me and opened themeeting by reading the 35 ch. of Isaiah and prayed mightily for meI then arose and preached (it was said) to thelargest congregation that ever met in the chapel. The minister wasbeleiving a^nd^ bid me God speed. After meeting many offered themselvesfor baptismOn the morrow I baptized 13 more four ofwhom were preachers and afterwards I held a meeting in anotherplace at the house of brother Kington. 
 angels on high and brought down the power which rested mightily upon usAfter being in the upper room about two hours we again joinedthe congregation of the Saints in the lower lcourt and the house came to orderfor the business of the day. The veils were closed and each appartment commencedthe service of the endowment.The washing of the feet of the anointed was the first businessthat was attended to in which the Twelve assisted the Presidency.Heber C. Kimble attended to the washing of my feet and prophesied uponmy head pronouncing me clean from the blood of this generation likeas it was with the disciples when Jesus washed their feet.When the ordinance of the washing of feet was ended theveils were roled which brought the congregation into one assembly butthe stands of the Priesthood was still covered with veils and the Presidencywas in the lower stand.The Prophet Joseph then arose and addressed thecongregation for the space of three hours, clothed with the power spiritand image of God. He presented many things of vast importanceto the Elders of Israel. O that the record could be written as withan iron pen of the Eight principles and virtue that came forthout of the mouth and heart of the Prophet Joseph whose miss[ion]soullike Enoch's seems wide as eternity. That day showed strikinglythat he is in very deed and a Prophet of God raised up for thedeliverence of IsraelHe desired us to give heed to his words andteachings and be wise that Zion and her stakes might beredeemed. He also presented us in some degree with the plotof the city of Kirtland which is the strong hold of the daughter ofZion. The plan which he presented was given to him byvision and the future will prove that the visions of Joseph concerningJackson County all the various Stakes of Zion and of the redemptionof Israel will be fulfilled in the time appointed of the Lord.Presidents Hyrum Smith Oliver Cowdery and Sidney Rigdon followed with suitable addresses to the congregation.The Twelve were then called upon to break breadfor the multitude as Jesus did in the days of this Apostles when themultitude followed him. [##Matthew 14:19-20##] This was done and the congregation wassatisfied and we were made glad while feasting with Patriarchs ProphetsApostles Evangelists Pastors and Teachers. [##Ephesians 4:11##]The feast ended thanks were returned to God with up-lifted hands to heaven. And this being at about the setting of the 
 confiscated and seized by Parliament and the body of the buildingconverted into stables and barracks. In the reign of Charles the Secondit was again repared but was not finished when it became a preyto the great fire of London in 1666. The new cathedral—the StPaul's of to day was built by Sir Christopher Wren. The firststone was laid on the 21st of June 1675 and the cap stone laidby the son of the Architect in 1710 and it was finished andissued by George the First in 1750 ^1715^. Its cost was over one millionand half sterling English money or nearly six million dollarsIts length from East to West is 500 ^ft^ and the breadth of thebody of the church 285 ft. and to the top of the cross over the domeits height is 404 ft: and it covers over two acres of ground.I again visited this cathedral on the 7th ofSeptember and went from the lower floor to the ball and visited every part of the building for public inspection. I walkedthrough the Whispering Gallery where a person can hear awhisper from any part of it and when the door shutsit penetrates the ear like peels of thunder.On the 25 of August we attended a meetingof the Temperance Society, at their Hall which we engaged,but could not have it until the 7th of the next month. Br Smithmade a short speech. On the following day, we started out to try toget some doors opened for preaching. Brother Kimballwent to one part of the city and brother Smith and myselfto another. We called upon two Baptist Ministers andasked one for his chapel. In the evening we attended a Methodist meeting in Song LaneNext day we again went to the TemperanceHall, in St George's Road, near the Elephant & Castle, and by therequest of the meeting  ^comittee^ I addressed the meeting upon the subjectof temperance, followed by George A Smith. We gave outan appointment to preach the Gospel at that place Sep the 7thThe day after we all started out to gothrough the city of London to see if we could find aman with the Spirit of God; and after wandering throughthe city, not Knowing whither we went, we came upon aman and stoped him and spoke to him. BrotherKimball asked him if he was a preacher? He said 
 On the 2nd of April I baptised 3 in ^Apperly^and 6 in Leigh and then walked to Twigworth and preachedand afterwards returned to Leigh.Two days afterwards I baptised eleven womenat Gadfields Elm and on the next which was Sunday I metfor prayer-meeting at Leigh.After meeting we went to a brother's forthe purpose of again administering the ordinance of baptismTen prepared for the ordinance but before we closed singingand prayer a desperate mob gathered together of about a hundredand the owner of the pond would not let us baptise whilesuch a mob was present fearing serious consequencesI then went in search of water in otherplaces for about of an hour with the mob following me, andrailing against me; but I could not find water and we had todefered it until the aftermoon. The mob commenced fitingghtingamong themselves and the people sent for constables to clearthe ground.After this I went to Norton andpreached and then returned to Leigh and the man gave hisconsent for me to baptize in his pondWe went immediately to the water andas I commenced to baptise the mob began to gather but Isucceeded in the administering the ordiance to nine personswhile surrounded by the rabble. I did not however receiveany injury nor did any of those baptised receive anymolestation except with the tongue. In the evening I preachedto a large congregation and the power of God rested upon usThe next day I baptized 5 more oneof whom was a preacher and another was a clerk in the Churchof England and two days afterwards I baptized seven more ^others^ andpreached to a large congregationThe day after I received two lettersone from Elder Willard Richards and the other from Elder JohnTaylor in which I was informed of the arrival of five ofthe Twelve and one of the Seventies. I was also advised thatthey had appointed a Conference at Preston on Wednesday the 15thof April and wished me to attend. 
 Sun all had the privilege of returning to their homes who felt sodisposed. The rest were to spend the night in the House of theLord in prayer exhortation praise and thanksgiving.At about candle-light the meeting commencedwith great interest. Joseph requested the congregation to speak theirfeelings freely and pray according to the Spirit.The Saints then began to open their mouths and theywere filled with language unto edification. One had a prayer anotheran exhortation another a doctrine some a psalm others a tongueand some an interpretation. Prophecy was also poured out uponus and all things were done decently and in order. Thus wasthe night spent glorously by the Saints; and the meeting havingcontinued until break of day we all dispersed to our homes with greatjoy and consolationThe next day I spent in writing my Journaluntil evening when I went up to the House of the Lord inwithElders Milton Holmes and Joseph B. Nobles. We were afterwardsjoined by an aged father in Israel by name Freeman Nickersonwho was very faithful and a man of much prayer. Beforehe joined us the power of Satan strove much against us; butour faith and peseverance in the Lord overcame him and wewere as baptized with the Holy GhostWhen we first entered the House of the Lordwe entered one of the Stands within the veils and fell upon ourknees but the Evil One strove against us with so much powerand temptation that at one time I was driven from mystand. But notwithstanding his apparant victory good grewout of it for by going into the courtyard I found father Nickersonwhom I solicited to join us that we might gain a victory overSatan. He joyfully accepted the invitation and we were nowfour in number and of one accord. Moreover we had greatcause to be united in heart for we had travelled together aboutone thousand miles in the Spring of 1834 for the redemption ofZion. At that time we offered to lay down our lifes and our offerings were accepted as was Abraham's [##Genesis 22##] and now we couldunitedly prevail and obtain a blessing through Jesus Christ.We fell upon our knees and cried mightily unto the Lord andthe Evil one departed and the Spirit of God within us was likefire shut up in our bones and many great things was shown untous by the Holy Ghost and minifested in prophecy and revelation 
 he was. He seemed to have a good spirit, and informed usthat he had been to America, and had come to London forthe purpose of going to South Australia, but had just burriedone child and another laid at the point of death. BrotherKimball told him his child should live. He gave us someinformation where we could preach. On the same day wecalled upon him and found his child better, but he wasnot at home. We then went and heard a Calvinest preachand he gave us an invitation to call and see himNext day we again went over the city to seeif we could any of the children of God. We found one manand his household who received our testimony, and he openedhis doors for us to preach. We appointed a meeting at his housefor Sunday evening. His name was Corner, and he lived at52 Ironmonger Row, St. Luke's Parish, near the church.Foundation of the Churchin The City of London.We had spent twelve days in going to and froLondon trying to find a people willing to receive our testimony,but finding the doors shut against us, we determined inthe name of God to into the streets and lift up our voicesAccordingly Elders Kimball, Smith, and myselfstarted out on Sunday morning, August the 30th; walkedthree miles and stoped in Tabernacle Square, Old Street, wherewe found an Aitkenite preaching to the people, who wasfollowed by a Presbyterian. Just as the latter was about tobegin, Elder Kimball informed him that there was a preacherfrom America present who would like to speak when hegot through. The preacher then informed the peopele thatthere was an American minister present, and proposed thathe should speeak first. Elder George A Smith then got intothe chair, and spoke about 20 minutes, and then the Presbyterianspoke. George A. had informed the people that there weretwo other American Preachers present who would like toaddress them; and, when the Presbyterian had closed, Elder 
 After preaching the niext night to a large congregationmany wished to be baptised but could not on account of the mob butsome wished to be baptised notwithstanding the persecutionAt about twelve o'clock at night I went to thepond to baptise. It was surrounded by a desperate mob and I baptisedfive persons in the midst of a shower of stones one of which hit me inthe head and ^which nearly^ knocked me down with the man whom I was baptised [baptizing]The next day I baptised 3 and I rode to Wolver-ampton and then took rail to Stafford. Here I found ten thousandpeople gathered to witness the hanging of two men. I came as nearto the jail as I could and in a few minutes they came upon thescaffold and almost immediately they were lanched into eternityThe gallows remained until 3' oclock whenit was removed I went into the jail and had an interview withElder Turley who had been falsely imprisoned upon a warrent fordebt which had been contracted fifteen years before he left Englandand which he supposed was settledI spent the night with brother Hulme andhaving spent the two next days in this district I took coach withElder Clark for Manchester and then being joined by Elder Claytonwe took the cars for Preston.On the 14th of April eighteen hundredand forty there was heldThe First Council of the Twelve Among the NationsThere was ^were^ present at this council Elders BrighamYoung Heber C Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt WilfordWoodruff John Taylor and George A. SmithElder Brigham Young was called to thechair to preside and John Taylor was chosen as Secretary.The Council was opened by prayer fromBrigham who was unanimously chosen as the Standing President ofthe Twelve and Elder Willard Richards was ordained to the Quorumof the Twelve by unanimous voice and according to a previousrevelation from the Prophet JosephAt the first sitting of the Council it wasresolved that he who may act as the Secretary of the Quorum shall 
 Sunday April the 9th I attended service in the House of the Lord. In the afternoon Elders Heber C. Kimble^all^ and Orson Pratt was followed by SidneyRigdon. He laid before them their situation as to temporal things saidthat the Gentiles were besieging the Saints and would gladly starve them todeath; that the Presidency had used every means for the deliverance of the Church; but that as many of the Church had refused Kirtland currency whichwas designed for our temporal salvation they had put strength into thehands of our enemies and thus the community must suffer by it.Joseph then arose and like the Lion of the Tribe of Judahpoured out his soul in the midst of the congregation of Saints. Whilelistening I thought "Who can find language to write his words and teachingsas with an iron pen in a rock that they might stand for future generationsto look upon." He seemed a fountain of knowledge from whose mouthstreams of eternal wisdom flowed; and ^as^ he stood before the peoplehe showed that the authority of God was upon him. When speakingof those who had professed to be his friends and the friends ofhumanity but who had turned traitors opposed the curancy andconsequently the prosperity of Kirtland he proclaimed that the Lordwould severely deal with. Joseph uttered the feelings of his soulin pain whie viewing the poverty and afflictions of the Saintsand in finding false brethren like whitened ^sepulcher^ whose course bringsperils upon the Church. [##Matthew 23:27##] Joseph is a father to Ephraim andto all Israel in these last days and he mourned because ofunbelief and the negligence manifested by many who have receivedthe Gospel and be feared lest but few be left of those in Kirtlandto recieve an inheritance. I wrote in my journal of this day,"There is not so great a man as Joseph standing in this generation.The Gentiles look upon him and he is like a bed of gold concealedfrom human view. They know not his principle his spirit,his wisdom his virtue his philanthropy nor his calling. Hismind like Enoch's expands as eternity and only God cancomprehend his soul.MY MARRIAGE.Marriage being an institution of Heaven and honorablewithal on the 13th day of April 1837, I joined hand with MissPhebe W. Carter in the bonds of holy matrimony. My firstacquaintence with my wife was on the eve of the 28th of 
 Kimball asked him if there would be any objection to our preachingthere at 3 o'clock. He answered "No;" not at all. Whatdenomination do you belong to?" "To the Church of JesusChrist of Latter Day Saints" was the reply"Oh I have heard of them" he said. They are"a bad people; they have done much hurt; they divide churches;"we don't want to hear you."He then mounted the chair again and said to the people,"I have just heard that the last man who spokebelongs to the Latter-Day Saints;" and then he began to railagainst us.Elder Kimball asked him to let him stopedepinto the chair to give out an appointment for a 3 o'clockmeeting, but he would not let him. Brother Kimball thenraised his voice and informed the people that some Americanpreachers would preach there at 3 o'clock. and at the appointedtime we were at the place.The conduct of the preacher andthe excitement upon the subject brought together a large congregation to hear us.I opened the meeting by singing andprayer and spoke about 20 minutes, from ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal I. 8, 9 v## andwas followed by Elder Kimball for about the same length oftime. The people gave good attention and seemed to bemuch interested in what they heardAfter meeting Mr Corner invited us homebut soon after we arrived at his house, Elder Kimballfelt impressed to return to the place of preachingWhen he got there he found a large companytalking about the things which they had heard, and they wishedhim to speak to them again. He did so and addressedthem at considerable length, and afterwards several invitedhim home to their houses.While he was away a man who had beena preacher came to Mr Corner's and I gave him a briefaccount of the great work of God in the last days andthey received the things which I spake unto them.

Kimballand seconded by Willard Richards that twenty of theSeventies be sent for and that it be left discretionarywith the President of the Twelve to send for more shouldhe think proper.On the next day of the Council ElderHeber C.

After two andhalf months acquaintance we were united in matrimony.Johnathan Holmes was married at the same time to MissMary Carter. The ceremony was performed at the houseof the Prophet Joseph by President Frederick Williams. ThePatriarch Joseph then blessed us in the name of the Lordand pronounced great blessings upon us and our posterityThe Prophet himself was to have solemnized the ceremonybut his life was so sought and beset by wicked menthat he was under the necessity of fleeing from his houseand home for a few days.We were married at 2 o'clock in the afternoonand at 4 o'clock the whole company consisting of aboutsixteen couple walked from President Joseph Smith's toPresident Sidney Rigdon's where we witnessed the marriageof Elder George Robinson and Miss Thalia Rigdon whowas also married by President F.

 Mr Corner offered himself for baptism. This was thefirst man in the city of London who offered himselffor the ordinance of the Gospel. We appointed the nextevening to administer the ordinance of baptism unto himAfter supping with him we returned home by wayof London Bridge which was so crowded as also were thestreets that it was difficult for a person to get alongI was weary when I arrived homeand unwell during the night, but felt thankful unto theLord for the privilege of preaching to the inhabitants ofthis great city and to have gained one soul as a sealto our ministryOn the 31st being the next day werepeated the first fruits of our labours and as it were laidthe first living stone of the Church of Jesus Christ inEngland's great metropolisWe walked into the city and called uponMr Corner; but on our way we received a letter fromsister Eliza Bromley in which she stated that she haddreamed that we should soon baptize a man who woulddo much good. After reading the letter and arrivingat the house of Mr Corner he went forward with usto the public Baths and received the initiatory ordinanceof the Gospel. He wasThe First Man Baptized in Londonand under the hands of Elder Heber C.

We visitedThe Thames Tunnelone of the greatest wonders of the world.We entered the Tunnel on the South side

 of the River Thames at Rotherhithe and after going about 800 feetdown into the earth we entered the archway on the left 1120 ft.of which was finished. It was beautifully lighted up with gas. Wewalked through the Tunnel with the River Thames and the shippingover our heads and in some places there is not more thanfifteen feet between the top of the arch and the bed of the riverThere are two archways running the whole length of the Tunnelwith openings affording free communications from one archwayto the other: At the time we visited the Tunnel it wasconsidered of the kind one of the most gigantic and wonderfulof human achievements. Visitors to this place of note in afteryears are familiar with a grand Bazar not there at the timewe visited it and Thames Tunnel purchases of Jewelry toys andfancy things are carried away by the visitors to all parts ofthe world as curiosities of association with one of the wonderfulplaces of London and momentoes of their purchasers visits to theGreat Tunnel under the monarch of England's rivers.About under In the centre of the River Thames we wrotein a record our names professions and residences and whenwe came out we went to the Tower of London in a boat, thedistance being about 2 miles. We did not spend muchtime here for it was getting late and we could nottherefore go through all the different appartmentsNext day I was quite ill. I had beenunwell for several days but now I was obliged to keep tomy room; but Elders Kimball and Smith went into thecity to visit the people and found some who hearkenedto them favourably. We had by this time found thatLondon was the hardest place for a mission which we hadever undertaken, but we did not feel discouraged in theleast; and were determined in the name of the Lord to setup the standard of the Kingdom in that cityThe following day I was still confined tomy room most of the dtime but on the next Elders Kimballand Smith went to Debtford, and I took a walk into thecity called upon Brother Corner and found him in good spirits.I also called upon Mr Panther, 17 Warf, City Road,Basin, who was a director of a Methodist chapel. I asked 
 Elder Willard Richards having been ordainedinto the Quorum of the Twelve Hyrum Clark was appointedCounsellor to Elder Fielding in the Presidency in the placeof brother Willard.Upon motion from Elder Fielding secondedby Brigham Young it was determined that a Hymn bookbe published and farther motioned that it be done underthe direction of the Twelve. A monthly periodical wasalso proposed.Several ordinations were attended toin the afternoon's Council.Heber C. Kimball laid before theconference the importance and propriety of ordaining aPatriarch to give Patriarchal blessings to the fatherless and tothe Saints according to the dictation of the SpiritAfter various remarks Bleazard Corbridgewas chosen by the Twelve to fill the Patriarchal office andPresident Fielding and his Counsellors proordained him.On motion by Brigham Young secondedby P. P. Pratt it was agreed that the next Conference should beheld on the 6th of July at Preston but it was subsequentlyarranged to be held at Manchester.The next ^day^ the 16th of April the Councilof the Twelve held its last sitting prior to the adjournmentBrigham Young proposed and John Taylor^seconded^ that Parley P. Pratt be chosen as the Editor of the monthly periodicalfor the Church. Elder Kimball moved and P. P. Pratt secondedthat a committee of three be appointed to make a selection ofHymns and Orson Pratt proposed and Willford Woodruffseconded that Brigham Young P. P. Pratt and John Taylorbe that CommitteeElder Willard Richards proposed thatthe name of the periodical be the Latter-day"Latter-day Saint's Millennial Star"George A Smith seconded this motionand Brigham motioned and Orson Pratt sustained that 
 him for the chapel to preach in. He said he had a school housewhich would ^hold^ 500 and that I might have that on Sunday. SoI gave out an appointment at Bowl Court 137 Thornditch. Iconversed with several others who received my testimonyand one woman said she would be baptizedI returned home by the way of Smithfieldmarket which covers about 20 acres of ground. It wasFair time and I never saw such a sight before. Therewere 20 acres of ground covered with cattle sheep andcaravans of beast of every name and large bands of musicbelonging to these "Shows" were playing to call the peopleto the exhibitions of the numerous manageries which hadgathered from all parts of the country to the SmithfieldMarket Fair. The^re^ was also a conglomeration of everythingthere. I thought, "Could a Missourian from the westernwiles of America whose Knowledge extended only to hisgun, corn, crib and hog-pen behold such a shight hewould think himself in another world and perhaps retireheart-sickened with the scene as I did; and no man wholoved virtue peace and retirement could feel otherwise inviewing a scene like the Smith field Market Fair. YetFairs are yearly heald in every part of the nation and infact they form one of the venerable institutions of theland. They are some of the "good old English relics" andare strikingly pictorial of "Merry England" of olden times^English^ Fairs are more plebian and belong more exclusively to thepeasantry and lower classes them English "Races". The latterthrough just as much a national institution of the peasantryand masses of England as the former also is a national institutionwith the higher classes. The English Race course is not onlycrowded with the tens of thousands of plebian stock but the crowds of nobility fashionable society and sportsman fromall the country around will be there gathered on race daysBut English Fairs and English Races from a moral point ofview are about on a level and there are none of the oldnational institutions of that country so illustrative of thetype of "Merry England" in olden times. They are infact pictorial to the last shade of colouring when viewed 
 the size and price of the paper be left with the Editor.On motions from Brigham Young seconded byHeber C Kimball and P. P. Pratt it was determined that the Saintswho desired to emigrate should receive a recommend from the Churchin Britian to the Church in America and that no one shouldbe recommended to go to America who had money unless theyassisted the poor according to the counisel of the Twelve.John Taylor motioned that the copyright ofthe Books of Mormon and Doctrine and covenants be securedas soon as possible. Parley P. Pratt sustained the motion;and Willford Woodruff farther moved that Heber C. Brigham YoungHeber Kimball and Parley be the committee to secure the copyrightWillard Richards sustained this motionHeber C. Kimball proposed and WillardRichards seconded that Elder Peter Melling be ordained an EvangelicalMinister in Preston.It was also proposed by Willard Richardsand seconded by Willford Woodruff that the Editor of the MillenialStar keep an account of all the receipts &c connected with printingand general expences and that the books at all times be open tothe inspection of the council of the Twelve.All the foregoing resolutions were unaminouslyadopted.The total number of the Saints in Englandand Scotland were 1671 including the Priesthood. The officialmembers were as followsElders 34; Priests 52Teacher 38; Deacons 8Total of Priesthood 132The Council of the Twelve closed itsfirst conference among the nations on the 16th of April havingbeen convened three days. I felt happy to have the privilegeof sitting with my brethren of the Twelve to consult uponthe establishing of the work of God among the nations andkingdoms of the earth and it was with much satisfaction thatI preached in the Temperence Hall to a crowded congregation on theevening of the second day of our Conference. 
 as fine illustrative panoramas of "Merry England" in genuine "goodold English times." Now a day they are but the holliday realitiesof the nation and are only relics of the past and not characteristics ofthe present but in olden times fairs and races were the nationalholliday pictures magnified of "Merry England" in every day lifeSmithfield Market Fair as viewed by me that day was one of thesepictorials of the merry days of yore. It is years the scene wasrepulsive to me but it was none the less illustrative of thenational characteristics of the past. In later years this fairwhich was known by the name of Bartholemew Fair wasabolished by the muncipal authorities of London.Visit to Westminster AbbeySeptember the 5th Elders Kimball Smith andmyself visited the Westminster Abbey. Here going throughevery appartment we saw all the toomes and monumentsof the Kings Queens Princes Lords and noted men who haveever been entommbed within its walls.One part of the Abbey was built in theyear 600 and has now stood over 1200 years. Most ofthe kings and queens of England are entoombed inWestminister Abbey who have died during those twelvecenturies.Here we saw what are esteemed perfectlikeness of Queens Elizabeth Mary and Ann, LordNelson Pitt and others. We saw the full coronationdress of Queen Ann and also the chair in which QueenVictoria and all the Kings and queens for the last eighthundred years were crowned. This chair of State iscovered with gold tissue and it contains a stone underthe seat in which all the Scottish chiefs and Scotland'sKings were crowned since they were a people. Fabuloustradition delclare this stone to be the identical stone thatwas Jacob's pillarIn this chair of State in which Royalty had sat tobe crowned during eight hundred years we sat thisday yet not with any extravigant reverance for the 
 1840CHAPTER XVI[twelve blank lines]As I am now entering upon thatpart of my labours in the English mission where I becameassociated with more of my brethren the Twelve in ourministry in a foreign land I will here open a newchapter by a briefSummary ViewofMy Mission in Herefordshireprior to the Council at Preston.Being led by the Spirit I visitedFroom's Hill Herefordshire on the 5th day of March 1840and commenced preaching the word of God unto the people andmany received my testimony.I commenced baptizing & In one month and five days Ihad baptised 158 souls.I baptized Mr Thomas Kingtonthe Superintendant of the Church of United Brethren whichcame out of the Methodist connection. I also baptizedforty-eight preachers of the United Brethren and one hundred 
 held at meeting in Tabernacle square, at 3 o'clock, in the afternoon at which Elders Kimball and Smith preached andI bore my testimony to their words. One man aroseand opposed us, and was angry because of the truth ofGod. He continued opposing, until the police stopedthe conversation.We met again in the evening at BowlCourt, to preach to the people, but when we got there wefound a plan contrived by several of the preachers forone of them to preach, lest some should beleive ourtestimony. When we found this, we went our way andfound four persons who received our testimony andoffered themselves for baptismNext day I wrote to Elder Browett ofmy Herefordshire field of labour and walked to BroCorner's and visited several other friends. Two offeredthemselves for baptism. I visited St Paul's and thenreturned home. Elders Kimball and Smith hadjust returned fromA Visit to the Rev. Robert AitkenHe received them kindly, acknowledged theirdoctrine true, but was affraid of deception. His mindwas in a disturbed state.In the evening we held a meeting inthe Temperance Hall; but we had almost the barewalls to preach to, there being only about thirty presentI preached to the few present for about an hour andElder Kimball followed me. After paying 7/6/ seven shillingsand six pence for the use of the hall we returned to ourlodgings.Part of the next day we spent invisiting places and things connected with the crown. Westarted out together and walked to King St. and UnionSt. and passed by Surry Chapel which was built andoccupied for many years by the celebrated Rowland Hillwhose body lies under this chapelFrom thence we continued to WestminsterBridge which brought us direct to Westminster Abbey 
 and twelve of the members of that Church.This threw into my hands under mysuperintendence forty-two places of worship already establishedand licensed according to law including one regular chapel.When I left this vast field of labour toattend Conference at Preston there was ^were^ nearly 200 more personsready to enter into the Church; and among those already numberedwith us were the preachers of the United Brethren before mentionedand one clerk of the Church of England and a number of wealthyfarmersThis opened the largest field of labourand was the greatest increase of the Church in the BritishMission and when I left this vast field of labour to go toPreston to attend Conference there were nearly two hundredmore souls ready to be baptized as soon as an opportunityoffered of whom after my return I found that Elder Kingtonhad baptized ten and Priest John Cheese twenty makingthe number of souls belonging to the Church in Herefordshireone hundred and eighty eight. I will now again take upthe regular thread of my history from my daily journalfor 1840.I had spent the 14th 15 and 16th of Aprilsitting in Council with my brethren the Twelve and the Saintswho ghad come up to this general conference of the BritishMission; and on the evening of the 20^15^th I preached in theTemperence Hall to a crowded congregationOn the 17th being Good Friday the Twelvemet at Penworthham two miles from Preston to visit theSaints and spend the day together before they seperated fortheir several fields of labour. Sister Moon opened a bottleof wine for us to bless and partake of. This bottle of wineshe had kept for forty years. After spending the dayin conversing about the things of the Kingdom of God wereturned to Preston.The time had come for the Twelve to seperateand go into different parts of the Lord's vinyard. It wasthought widsom for Elder Heber C. Kimble to visist the Churcheswhich he had built up while in England on his former 
 and the House of Parliament. We walked throughthe House of Lords and Commonsof England and sat in the chair in which the speakers of the houseof Lords had sat for many years. In this room all thespeeches were made by that great orator William Pitt concerningAmerica before the revolution. As the House of Commonswas burned down about six years before our visit this roomiswas then occupied by the Commons and there was anotherhouse built for the Lords at that timeOne would naturally suppose that aroom fitted up to contain the Lords and Commons ofEngland would be extraordinary grand and expensive butit is quite the reverse being exceedingly plain and undecoratedOn entering the room one would soonerthink he was in an American School House than inthe House of the Lords of EnglandNext we visited St James Park andsaw a company of two hundred foot soldiers the GrenadierGards on parade accompanied by a fine martial bandAfterwards we saw the Queen's Horse Guards on paradeone hundred in number with their bodies coveredwith steel which shone right martially. They worehelmets and breastplates of steel which glistening in thesun's rays made them appear as though they were encasedin polished armour; and they were mounted on powerfulblack mares whose glosy coats and high mettle wellbecame the pride and pomp of war. It would be hardto convince an Englishman that the Queen's Horse Guardswas not the finest regiment in the world. The chargeof the Guards at Waterloo is immortalized by the Wellingtonianhousehold tradition of "Up Guards and at them" which wonthat famous battle upon which the destiny of Europe hungand gave to the Iron Duke the crown of glory as conquererof Napoleon the Great. We may be told by thosewho are sceptical to popular traditions that the greatDuke never uttered this famous command and we may read that Welington himself was doubtful of the tradition stillthe masses will beleive it and the "Up Guards and at them!" 
 mission and O[r]son Pratt to go North on mission to ScotlandJohn Taylor was to continue his labours in Liverpool andParley P. Pratt to proceed to Manchester and publish theMillennial Star. (After years revealed that this newperiodical which was the first Church organ of foreign missionswas destined to live through many volumes and probablywill continue to be (as in 1865) the oldest periodical andofficial organ in the Church. At the date of this transcriptit has passed through the hands of numerous editors andhas reached its twenty seventh volume.)It was further arranged by the Twelvethat Elder G A Smith should go to the poteries andElders Brigham ^Young^ and Willard Richards go with me intothe field of labour which I had opened in Herefordshire andthe adjoining countryOn the 18th I parted from the rest ofthe Twelve who were to branch out in other directionsand with Brigham Young started on my return to myfields of labour. We took train a^nd^ journied to Manchesterand then continued by coach to Burslem where we spentthe night at brother JohnstonsNext day being Sunday Elder B.Young preached to the people of Hanly in the morningand evening and in the afternoon we communed withthe Saints and spent an interesting time. We spentthe night at Stoke with Brother Hulme.The following day we took coach atStoke and rode to Stafford and thence to Wolverhamptonwhere we stayed for the night and on the morrow weproceeded by coach to Dudly and had a good view of theold Dudly castle and from thence to Worcester in whichcity we spent several hours.Here we visited the ancient and notedWorcester Cathedral which surpassed for splendor andarchetecture anything which I had ever viewed. Its lengthis about 400 feet and this magnificient structure is between[blank space] and yet in stands in ourown days in stately grander for surpassing the archetectural 
 of Wellington will live side by side on the page of nationaltradition with Nelsons "England expects every man this dayto do his duty!" I thought the renowned Horse Guardsmost certainly a magnificient regiment any how. They areto the English Army what Napoleons "Old Guard" was to the^French^ but while the "Old Guard" of the Emperor was broken foreverat Waterloo, the Horse Guards of the grand Willingtoniancharge lived to do splendid service and maintain theirprestige in after years in the Crimean war fighting sideby side with the French whose Imperial head wasstill a Napoleon as before. This time they were aliesand not foes yet then the French won from the Englishsome of the glory lost at Waterloo in spite of the factthat the Queens Guards and the crack regiments of Englandnever behaved better, for instance that madly brilliantBalaclavia charge at the Light Horse of the English armyIn viewing and visitng the famous things and places ofLondon I always felt interested in their historical associationsand reminenscencesPassing from the martial view of theQueens Horse Guards we visited the monument errectedin honour of the Duke of York which was 135 feet inheight. Here I parted from Elders Kimball and Smith andwalked the whole length of St James' Park. It has afine pond in the centre and mansions and palacesaround.I first visited the palace of theQueen Dowager widow of William the Fourth next themansion of the Duke of Sumerset ^Somerset^ which was quitesplendid and then Buckingham Palace. This palacewas occupied by Her Majesty Queen Victoria and His HighnessPrince Albert. It covers a number of acres of groundand every door enterance and gate was strongly guarded byarmed soldiersI walked nearly around this palace andwhile doing so I had the privilege of seeingHis Royal Highness Prince Albert 
 of England there who manifested much of the Devil by stirringup mobs against the Saints which had in several instances muchdisturbed the meetingsOn the 16 I had joined Elder Kington inDymock and that evening we were to hold at his house theweekly prayer meeting of the Branch.As we began to gather together the beatingof drums and kettles were heard through the street and themob soon collected and paraded in front of the houseWe closed the window and shutters and doors in the house andI opened the meeting with singing and prayerBut we had no sooner commenced thanthe mob armed themselves with rocks bricks eggs and anything they could lay their hands upon and began to throwthem at the house like a shower of hailstones for nearlyan hour. They dashed in the windows scattered bricks andglass through the rooms broke the tiles of the roof andcontinued such depredations until the close of the meetingThe brethren being disposed to test the virtue of the lawswhich were strict against such outrages I proposed togo into the midst of the mob to see who they were butthey would not permit me lest I should receive injuryfrom the shower of stones. Several of the brethrenhowever went themselves and took down the names ofthe leaders and returned to the house in the midst of avolley of stones and brik-bats but without injury. Soon afterwards the mob broke up and having cleared the roomof the bricks stones and glass we laid down to restand had a good nightI was at Froom's Hill on the 18thand found the Saints in good spirits and learned thatElder Turley had sailed from Liverpool on the 8th with acompany of 200 Saints. Brother and Sister Benbowand the rest of the emigrant company were rejoicing in theLord and in their Zion bound journeyThe 20th was well spent and was aninteresting day. I preached at Froom's Hill and communed withthe Saints and also at Standly Hill. 
 monuments of this age.This cathedral contains many monumentsand marble sculptured figures over the toombs of ancient BishopsLords and Princes some of whom had laid there for sevenor eight hundred years. It is said that some of these monumentswith their marble sepulchre drapery are as neatly executed as anyfound in Europe. Almost everything about this magnificientchathedral from the dome to the basement is carved out of solidmarble. The pulpit is also hewn from solid stone. Thereis a large organ in the building and the Church of Englandhold service in it twice each day in the year. We staid during one service.From Worcester we rode to Ledbury andon the road we passed through the town of Malvern onMalvern Hill which commands the splendid prospectof all the surrounding country for thirty miles on someof the highest peaks of which are large entrenchments wheremen retreted in the time of the Roman invasion. The buildings in the village of Malvern are fine and verypicturesque in appearence standing on the side of these^hills^ Malvern is a noted place which the nobility and gentryof England visit in the Summer season. We hada view of Eastner castle as we past along. That nightwe spent at Mr Francis Pullins in LedburyOn the next day we walked to Froom'sHill and called upon brother John Benbow and had aninterview with Elder Kington. In the evening we held aChurch meeting at Stan^d^ly Hill to do Church business. Thiswas the first meeting at which Brigham Young waspresent in this district of country and I will therefore subjointhe following minutes from my Journal:Minutes of the First MeetingAttended By Brigham YoungIn HerefordshireStandly Hill BranchApril 22nd 1840 
 He rode from the palace across St James' Park mounted ona grey horse followed by his groom and was not accompanied byHer Majesty or any other person. He was dressed in a frock coatand dark pants. He looked fresh and healthy and in theyoung Spring of life being only twenty years of age. I did notsee Queen Victoria for she was at Windsor Castle at this time.I next visited the National Gallery andviewed its choice and extensive collection of the best paintings ofthe great masters of the art and afterwards St Martin's Churchwhen I concluded that I had seen as much as my brain couldcontain for one day. Three miles walk farther throughthe city brought me to Brother Corner's where I again joinedElders Kimball and Smith. We spent a little time with thefriends and returned to our lodgings and spent the night.My Return to HerefordshireNext day September the 9th I paid my bills and called upon the friends, in company of brothers Kimball and Smith,and the day following I parted from the brethren and friendsin London to return to Herefordshire.We had spent twenty three days inthat great Babylon of modern times and had found it harderto establish the Church there, than in any place wherewe had ever been. We had baptized one man, and ordainedhim a priest; and six others had given in their names tobe baptized on the following Sunday; and at this timethere was some little prospect of the Reverend Robert Aitkenreceiving the work. I, therefore, left London feeling thatour mission and labours had not been altogether in vainI took the omnibus three milesto the Great Western Railway Padington and at 9 o'clockstarted for Herefordshire and as I passed Windsor Castle andsaw the British flag flying from it as signal that herMajesty was there.Arriving at Cheltenham at 4 o'clockby coach from Farrinton road Station forty miles I metElder Browett and wife and several others of the Saints

Benediction from W. Woodruff 
 These two conferences, with their forty branchchurches, and over a thousand organized members, underthe direction of one hundred and thirteen ordained officers,had been raised up inwithin six months and a half. Surelythe work of God had been marvellous, unparalleledperhaps in the history of any new religious movementunparalleled in the foundation of Christian churches ofevery denomination either in ancient or modern timesTo God the Giver of the power and efficacy of ouradministration of the Gospel in Herefordshire and regionsaround be the glory and not unto the humble ministersof that workI meditated upon these things andin my journal of date Sept 21st 1840 I wrote thus:"This has been a busy day with me. Afterstanding upon my feet from morning till evening I amcalled to shake hands with hundreds of Saints with gladhearts and cheerful countenances. It is with no ordinaryfeelings that I meditate upon the cheering fact thata thousand souls have been baptized into the Newand Everlasting Covenant in about half a year in one fieldwhich God has enabled me to open. I pray Him to acceptthe gratitude of my heart for his mercies and blessingsunto me in this thing and enable me to stand withthese Saints and all the righteous in His Celestial Kingdom"This day I had stood upon my feeteight hours in conference conversed much of the time in suggesting^speeking^ motioning &c; ordained about 30 confirmed some healedmany who were sick shook hands with about 400 Saintswalked 2 miles and ended with 4 hours of chimney cornerpreaching. I then laid down to rest and dreamt ofcatching fish.Next day I was called upon to visita young man who lay dangerously ill and in dangerof the lockjaw from a cut of the ancle and bruiseof the knee. I rebuked the inflamation and pain ofthe body and he was made whole. I baptizedEdward Jones a Game keeper and confirmed two 
 Next day I walked from Turkey Hall to Forty Greenand wrote a letter to Lady Roberts a companion of thelady of Squire Dowdswell and sent it by the handof sister Brooks.Lady Roberts was of the nobility ofEngland and a lady of wealth, and had withdrawnfrom the Church of England and the travelled muchin search of truth looking for the fulfilment of theProphets.She became acquainted with the fulnessof the Gospel through a female servant in the employof Squire Dowdswell. She began to investigatethe subject; and the Spirit of God rested upon herand convinced her of the truth of the work. and sSheobtained the 4 numbers published of the MillennialStar and fearing that she should not be able toobtain them for herself, copied the whole of themwith her pen. She also read the Book of Mormonand copied a part of that, and became perfectlyconvinced of the truth of the work of which sheread, and said she would go a thousand milesbut what she would see some of the Twelve andbe baptized under their hands. and hHearing thatI was in London she was about to take a journeythere to see me, and the other brethren, and be baptizedShe had two brothers ministers of the Church ofEngland.Having returned from London, I, therefore, addressed her by letter upon the work of God, into whichat that time she was so earnestly entering, to whichshe returned me a verbal answer by Sister Brooks, thankingme kindly for the interest which I manifested in her welfare,and saying that she should address me by letter in a few daysElder Kington in Dymock had faithfullywarned the people and had succeeded in raising up achurch of fifty Saints. This had stired up theinhabitants of that place to much anger against usand especially the Rev. John Simons Rector of the church 
 The day following I was called upon to visit anotheryoung man who lay dangerously ill with the fever. Hecovenanted to keep the commandments of God and Ianointed him and rebuked the fever and he beganto recover. I also visited an aged Saint upon herdeath bed and blessed her. She was rejoicing inthe fulness of the Gospel in deathThe church ministers at this time were verymuch stirred up in this region because of the success of thework of God in the midst of the people and every exertionwere made by them to stay its progress. They were findingthat the Lord was delivering their flocks out of their handsand giving them unto the shepherds of the church of theSaints. They were alarmed and were holding conventionsand meetings to contrive plans and adopt means to over-throw the Latter-day Work of God which they understoodnot and beleived not yet feared its power. And wellindeed they might for in some instances they did nothave more than 10 or 15 at their churches on the Sabbathwhile around them on every hand they had seen fortyBranch^es^ of two organized conferences of the Church ofLatter-Day Saints spring up in about six months withover a thousand members and between one and twohundred officers ordained to scatter the ^seed of the^ Gospel everwhereupon the new broken ground of ^in^ this prolific fieldOn the 25th the time had come forme again to take leave of the Saints in my Herefordshirefield of labour. I wrote an address to Elders Kimballand Smith baptized one and confirmed two and aftervisiting the Saints until midnight I took the partinghand with them and started on my journey at 12 o'clockat night.I rode from Froom's Hill at night ina cart to Worcester 15 miles took coach and thence 40 milesto Wolverhampton. Here I rode 2 miles by the omnibusto the railroad Station and travelled by rail 30 milesto Whitmore Station where I again took omnibus 9 milesto Hanley and then rode in a gig to Burslem.
