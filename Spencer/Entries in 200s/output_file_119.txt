President Young said I have often thought of the words of Solomon that a wise child was Better than an old and foolish king I could pick out many Boys in this Church 16 years old more fit for Bishops than many old men who are Bishops there are but few men who seem calculated to make Bishops The Brethren then went to Willow Creek to settle a Difficulty with Elder A Cordon the President and Bishop Dives there were three or Four charges brought against Brother Cordon but when they were all investigated they did not amount to any thing as a fault all the Branch  voted to sustain him as President the Bishops councellor for the men who accused him four of his accusers were  cut off from the Church. The people did not like to vote for Bishop Dives unless he would go by the council given him He had it was said that the Bishop had a watch which he carried that was tithing property and a cow they had milked all summer and No credit given on the tithing Books andc these matters were not much investigated.

O Hyde thought He knew much more than Bishop Dives. President Young said He is not calculated for a Bishop He is a good man for a President and in spiritual things But was not calcu- lated for a Bishop. Their is another thing Lorenzo Snow presides over that region and is a prudent wise man yet he has strong pregudices and does not pull on the same strings that I do there has been a kind of a spirit to keep Dives Down But I believe if he had had the sole controll of  things there as the president opened the meetings and preached to the people He would have made a good smart preacher But I never saw the man that was kept down by his superiors that could rise above it John Taylor asked who is the greatest the President or the Bishop.

But any one of the Twelve while officiating in his office in any part of the world are the Presidency of the Church the same as we are at home their power is the same as ours and they should investigate and regulate all matters appertaining to the Church, without any regard to whatever instruction they may have received    ENDENTRY November 3, 1858 ~ Wednesday   3rd I spent the day at home covering vines andc till 2 oclk and the rest of the day at the office    ENDENTRY November 4, 1858 ~ Thursday   4th I spent the day compiling History I planted some peach stones, Apricotts and Plums and Currants in the morning I spent the evening with President Young B Stringham and Lewis Robinson.

Foss then said dam you I will  shoot you if you ever follow me again you just try it again and I will use you up. Hopkins Fendor went into the street and told the Mayor of it he asked him why he did not knock him down He said why did you not go into the street and get  help the remark was made that He ought to be taken up {President Young} one said I would not take him up if he was to threaten my life in that way. Brother James Ida called upon President Young for council to go to Calafornia to settle his busines President Young advised him to remain and appoint some men there to settle it this Brother Ida raised a large crop of wheat for the saints in Calafornia   ENDENTRY November 9, 1858 ~ Tuesday   Nov 9th I spent the day in the office compiling History I spent the evening with President Young the time was spent mostly in conversation upon taning leather and making fish oil Homer Dunkan some 20 gallons of fish oil but it was like soap and good for nothing he had kept it stiring all summer and spoiled it.

Gov Cummings thought  our adjournment to Great Salt Lake City was illegal because it was done by a Joint resolution of both Houses in Joint Session he considered it not of the same validity as an act in separate houses he was informed that several of the states in the Union was received and admitted into the Union by a Joint vote of both Houses of Congress and we establi- shed the seat of Government at Filmore by a Joint resolution of both houses and if our removal of the seat of Government to Great Salt  Lake City was not legal then the esstablishment of the seat of Government at Filmore was not legal Hence we have no seat of Government. It is a singular argument of Gov Cummings  that the unanimous vote of the two houses in Joint session weakens the power of Legislation and is not of the same force  and validity that it would be if passed in separate Houses such an argument contains neither force or power    ENDENTRY November 14, 1858 ~ Sunday   14th Sunday The conference met at 10 oclok.

Brother Wall  related a circumstance of an officer of the Armey who ask  him if he was a Mormon yes, I supose you are an out and in mormon Just as it suits you? I am a thorough mormon I believe  in all their principles. What poligamy and all? Yes, How many wives have you? I have three and Twelve children.  How do you suppose those children will look upon you when  they get Groan up? I will tell you how they will look upon  me they will point to me and say theire is my Father  who has raised me fed, clothed, and Educated me and owned me through persecution oppression and scorn and I will  own honor and obey him, while your children at Fort Levensworths St Louis and all places whare you have been  which you will not own nor provide for they will not own you and their mothers will point to you as they see you pass and will say there is your father but dont say a word  about it for the world those children will both Hate and  despise you and the vary Ground upon which you tread Capt Wolf replied scratching his head By ... that is true but I never looked upon it in that light "What would you do if the Government should give orders to put  you to death if you did not put away your wives? I would take my wives and wives children and go to some secluded spot of Earth whare I could enjoy my wives and children and liberty "What if the Government should pounce onto you and not give you the privilege? then I would take my family into the mountains and I would fight you over evry hill and dale as long as I lived   Capt Woolf replyed I will not shoot at you. Capt Woolf said Governor Young ought to be the next President for He is the smartest man in the United States He has  been playing a game of Ucre Euchre with the United States and  has beat them, he had gained five points while the United States has ownly had a march and he ought to be  president and I would vote for him.   The man who was  a waggon master of the train which Lot Smith burned  said Capt Smith and his men were Gentlemen it was the best thing for me and your people that could have been done it released me and sent me back to the states or I should  have suffered with the rest in the mountains and it was well  for the mormons for if this train had not been burned the Armey would probably have pushed on had a fight and blood been spiled The Gentiles have undertaken to build a City on Provo Bench Wall offered to take the water out for $200000.

He said he had had  FIGURE an interview with the Judges and Civil officers of  the US court and they asked him for a posse to take Brigham Young before the court and asked for council  He told the Judges he would advise them to rule in court that when any man wished to subpoena  a man to come before the court that the man should  make an Affidavit that the person was an Essential  witness and state what he wished to prove by him and send it to the man before he forced him to appear  Judje Sinclair thought favorable of it but Cradle Baugh swore he would not submit to  it. Judge Sinclair said he would not esstablishing  rulings in his court without notifying the Govornor  of it Govornor Cumings said he should not think it good  policy to esstablish Forcible measures in Forceing Brigham  Young toand others to appear in court on evry frivolous case  and even not at all untill the character of the United States  courts had been better esstablished in this Territory than  they had heretofore for you all know damned well that  the people Here have not been vary civilly or lawfully  treated in many instances by dignitaries, and during  the present excited state of things I think it would be  policy to take pacific measures and not try to create disturb- ance among the people.

It has been an eventful  year a year in which the hand of God has been made  more visible than in any other period during the present  Generation, some of the greatest events have transpired  during the past year ever manifest among men. the  successful laying of the submarene Atlantic Telegraph  by which communication has been made between two  continents by means of an electrict wire on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean is the most steupendious work ever  achieved by man. Europe and America have made liberal  treaties with China and Jappan which have opened their ports to the trade, commerce and intercourse with the whole  world which have been heretofore entirely closed up  for thousands of Generations. The Emperor of Russia  has laid the foundation for the liberation of millions of  surfs from a species of slavery which has existed for sCentauries. The inhabitants of British India have  risen in their wrath to throw off the British yoke and  rivers of Blood as it were has been caused to flow in that land and the spirit of war has been poured out upon  all Nations and France and other Nations have been  arming and preparing for a Deadly conflict. The whole  Earth is becoming corrupt before God, wickedness and  abominations are rapidly increasing throughout all Nations  The Gospel of Jesus Christ has beeen offered to all Nations  By the Elders of Israel whareever they could get access  to the people and the world in a great measure have rejected the Gospel and the Lord is with holding his spirit from the   ENDENTRY inhabitants of the Earth and the people are waxing worse and  worse and are becomeing filled with all manner of lying  deceavings robing whoredoms, murders Blasphemies and wicked- ness of evry kind. Yea Emperors, Kings, Princes, Lords  Presidents Govornors Judges and all the Ruellers of the whole  Earth as well as the people have become so corrupt before  God that He is angry with them and the Lord is begining  to visit them with war and bloodshed and with pestilence tempest  thunder lightning and great hail, whirlwinds and devouring fire  this is plainly manifest in our own Nation even the  United States which is corrupt above all other Nations, they  have sought the destruction of the Saints of God in this land  but the Lord has faught the battles and preserved his saints  The Lord hath done ^it^ his work has been visible before our eyes  and we will acknowledge his hand therein. The United States  Govorment sent fourteen thousand men including souldiers and teamsters to Heber  C. Kimball Daniel H. Wells The Twelve Apostle and other leaders  of the Church, they travelled One thousand Miles and expended  some thirty Millions of Dollars to accomplish this evil design  even to shed the Blood of the Lords aniointed. But the Lord  Hedged up their way they had to spend the winter in the  snows of the everlasting rocky mountains and live upon  the flesh of their animals and when they did enter our  valies and cities it was by the permission of the prophets  and saints of God for whom they had come one thousand  miles to slay, and instead of haveing the privilege of sheding  the Blood of the Prophets in Utah but vary few of them  have been permitted to behold their faces. President  Buchannan also sent Judges and officers to this territory who are filled with wickedness, madness and abominations  of evry kind, they have also laid secret plans to destroy the prophets and bring distress upon the people by their  decrees from the Judgment seat but the saints have called  upon the Lord in mighty prayer and the Lord has heard and  answered them and he has taken away the wisdom of the  Judges and their power and their folley is manifest in  the eyes of the people and the power of God is manifest in  all these things and he has preserved his Prophets Church  and Kingdom, against all the wrath of the President, Congress,  their armies, Judges and all the Devils who enter into  the tabernacles of men to fight against God and his saints  Judge Sinclair has held an open United States District Court tofrom the 4th day of Oct. up to the last of Dec  being 88 days and tried all in their power to get  up some action against Brigham Young and the leaders  of the Church but have accomplished a solumn Nothing  ownly tried to persecute James Furgerson and have not been enabled to do much of that for the Lord has held  them so fast that they have not been enabled to accom- plish any evil plan which they have laid.
