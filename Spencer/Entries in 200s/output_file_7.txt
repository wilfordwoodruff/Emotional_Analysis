 The following are some of the important words  that flowed from President Youngs lips as he  addressed the people and called upon them  loudly to repent he said you must stop your  swearing, you must stop your cheating, you must  stop your lying, you must stop your stealing  you must stop your horedoms you must  stop your back biteings, speaking evil of the  Twelve speaking evil of me, you must stop  these things & put away your wickedness  or you will be damned, you will be destroyed  you will be visited by pestilence and plague  and by the sword, and you will fall to the  ground and I warn you and fore warn   you of these things if you do not repent  yes councellors, High Priest and Elders  here in the Camp of Israel will say I will  de damned if I will pay my tithing or if  I will do this or that, if God was like man  He would hurl you down to Hell & let  you lie and welter there a thousand  years and his mercy ownly keeps you out  there are many here that are corrupt and  rotton at the core and I have no more   fellowship for them than I have for  John C Bennett if I fellowship these   things it will drag me down to Hell with  you and I will not do it brother Joseph   being a vary merciful man bore with  these things untill it took his life but  I will not do it men get led away by   degrees untill the devil gets possession of   there tabernacle and they are led captive  at the will of the devil and now I say  that those who are calculating to continue     
 in wickedness and serve the devil had better  go no further with this camp they had better   go to Missouri and spend the rest of ther  time with the gentiles for I can swear   to them if they go with us & continue  there wickedness there heads shall  be served from theie tabernacles and the  devils that are in them shall go and   have no tabernacles to dwell in the  truth of the matter is there are many  places we pass through that have been the  slaughter ground of the ancient Nephites  and Lamanites and the spirits of Devils are  hovering around it and if you are not on  your guard they will enter you and lead  you captive at their will for if you are  not governed by the spirit of God you will  be by the spirit of the devil. and if you  are governed by the spirit of God while   in such places and they cannot enter   any of you they will try to enter your  cattle your beast, for they want to enter  some tabernacle as they did the swine  in ancient days. I had rather go to the  mountains with the Twelve alone and  not to have another soul with us than  to have those who will not be subject  to the Priesthood but practice wickedness  and serve the devil for if we continue   with this company and they do not  repent the righteous will fall with the  wicked. There are people now in this camp  who are stealing hay and wood and I know  who they are will I fellowship them no   I will not and because we know who is  guilty of wickedness they think we are     
 fellowshiping them and doing the same   ourselves but it is not so and Joseph suffered  much from the same cause because he  knew of the rascality and wickedness  His enemies and many of the saints thought  he was guilty of it himself the truth of   the matter is those who are leading the  House of Israel while in the path of there  duty know the wickedness that is among  the people it cannot be hid from them  for they are in vision all the time.  I will now look a little upon the other  side of the question I will say however   that if we are a mind to be subject to  the will of the devil, Death, Hell and the  grave we may be & bow down to it all  the day long or we may have perfect   power and triumph over it. who am I  surrounded by, by men who arhave entered  into covenant with God, have recieved  endowments in the temple and are called  to be saviors upon mount Zion, to save who  our Fathers and Israel clear back to Father  Adam who are still lying in there graves  and waiting for the redemption of there  bodies through your instrumentality, then  will you curs, swear, lie, steal, commit adultey  and take the name of God in vain putty  saviors you would be, O shame God and   Angels would blush at such conduct. then  repent and do the work appointed yoo  many men are overtaken in a fault desire  to repent and turn to God shall we cast  such away Nay but bear with them     
 as God bears with us we cannot be sanctifyed  all at once, but have to be tried and placed   in all kinds of shapes and proven to the  utmost to see whether we will serve the Lord  unto the end so that we may be safe when  we come into the Celestial Kingdom of God   and not do as Lucipher did the first time  an oppertunity is offered rebel against  God and the Council of Heaven and be hurled   down to Hell in a manner that you could not  be redeemed at all and you must not sin  murmur and complain while in the midst   of your trials because you have been mobed  and tried even to the utmost it is no excuse for  you to commit a wicked deed take the name of  God in vain, or to do any evil, now all of   you quit it repent and turn to God and you  shall be blessed notwithstanding I have  thus reproved you I consider you the best  people as a body there is on the earth and  if there was any better I would go to   them and take you with them that  desired to go. In speaking of the redemption  of our dead I would say there are millions that  died from the days of Adam to Christ that are  waiting for there bodies to be raised but  few arose in comparison to the number at the  resurrection of Christ and they were  some that had the priesthood or fulness of  it sealed upon them after making many   other usful remarks he closed by blessing  the people believing they would repent  The remarks of president Young made a  deep impression upon the congregation  and I trust there will spedily be a refermation  in the Camp of Israel     
 I also met in council in the evening   with the Twelve High Council and  Bishop and herd the report of the  Bishops of each ward and other business  attended to. The following is a true report  of the Camp of Israel in this city called  winter quarters on this 20th Day of Dec  Total number of souls 3483 Yokes of oxen 388 1/2  Sick persons 334 cows 463  well men 502 Policemen 19  sick men 117 women whose husbands are in the armey 53  Absent men 138 Widows 75  Days tithing 84 1/2  Cords of wood drawn 83 3/4  Days on mill race 561 1/4  Waggons in Camp 814  Horses 145  Mules 29      December 21, 1846 ~ Monday      21st This day was taken up mostly   in drawing logs for a Council House I  spent a part of the day at home  Mrs Woodruff is still quit sick and is  passing through afflictions and trials      December 22, 1846 ~ Tuesday      22nd I spent this day in assisting the Twelve  in laying the foundation of the Council   House which is to be built of large logs  32 by 22      December 23, 1846 ~ Wednesday      23rd I was quite unwell this morning  yet I went to the woods this with  Father and choped 3 loads of wood   & brought home 2 loads I attended  meeting in the evening with our division  Br Benson attended with me and   followed me in addressing the people     
 I met in council with the Twelve on  the eve of the 22nd. Among other things  President Young spoke upon some   Principles one was concerning love beteen  man and wife Male and female as it  would be in the morning of the resur-  rection that in this life much called  love was more the effect of passion  than principle but in the resurrection  the love to the man would be according  to his exhaltation and glory      December 24, 1846 ~ Thursday      24th I was quite unwell this day I  spent the day at home choreing   choping wooden      December 25, 1846 ~ Friday      25th Christmas The dawn of Day was saluted  in the Camp of Israel by the report  of cannon from the hills by the artilery  I met in council with the Twelve [FIGURE] and  others and spent the day in a profitable  manner also the evening      December 26, 1846 ~ Saturday      26 [FIGURE] Spent this day in council also      December 27, 1846 ~ Sunday      27th Sunday I met in council at   [FIGURE] 10 oclok & spent the forenoon met with  the saints at the stand at 1 oclok O pratt  E. T. Benson and W. Woodruff Preached   to the People and at 3 oclok again met  in council and sat untill dark with the   Twelve the High Council and Bishops  then came in and sat untill 10 oclok      December 28, 1846 ~ Monday      28th I spent the day at work on the  Council House. we were visited from a  man from Hancock County his stay was short     
 December 29, 1846 ~ Tuesday      29th I went into the woods with Father  Woodruff and cut and drew two loads  of wood was informed on my return  home that the quorum of the Twelve met  in council at Br Kimballs at 3 oclok I  prepared myself as soon as possible & met  with them the principle object of meeting  was to take into consideration the subject of  organizing a pioneer company to go forward  and put in crops in the spring and prepare  the way for the Camp of Israel and   also to make preperations for the moving   of the camp the fore part of the evening  was occupied in conversing upon a variety  of subjects and had a little intermission  during which time Elders Young Kimball  and others had a little recreation and  bodily exercise and had prayers after  which Presidents Young and Kimball   spoke in tongues a while we then went  into council the final decision of which  was that we fit out a pioneer company   and follow them as soon as grass grows  the pioneer company to go this winter  as far as they could go on rushes and  brows then as far as they could on  grass untill it was time to put in   there corn crop. we had a good time   together and adjourned about 10 oclok      December 30, 1846 ~ Wednesday      30 I spent this day pitching hay I went  4 miles loaded two loads turned one over  on a side hill had it to load over and stack  them both on my return home, was vary  weary      December 31, 1846 ~ Thursday      31 The last day of 1846 I spent choring and  attended council at at night with the Twelve  High Council Bishops &c     
 [FIGURE]  On my return home from Council  I looked over my Journal for 1846  and the result of my labours will  be found on another page      And thus another year has past and  gone into eternity and has bourn its  report to God of me and all other  men. I still live upon the earth  with my brethren the Twelve  while many of my brethren have  been called into the eternal world  whatever I may have done or left  undone not pleasing in the sight  of my Heavenly Father I ask God  my Heavenly Father in the name   of Jesus Christ his Son to forgive  me and give me grace according   to my day during the year to   come and give me power and a  disposition to do good all the   days of my life be they few or  many and to save myself and  household and all committed to my  charge. One year ago this night   I was in Liverpool England but  this night finds me in the midst  of the Camp of Israel, at winter  quarters in the Omaho Nation in the  wilderness in the land of Joseph surrou-  nded by the Lamanites who are poor  wreched and miserable and have been  so for many generations in consequ-  ence of the sins of there forefathers     
 According to the prophesies of the   Prophet Lehi we have been rejected   by the gentiles on this land or continant   even the land of Joseph and the gentiles   have shed the blood of the Prophets   and Patriarchs JOSEPH &  HIRAM   and others and have sought the lives   of the Apostles and Saints and have   driven us out of their mids and   there by have rejected the Kingdom   of God with the keys, oracles, & revela-  tions thereof which we have taken   with us, which remain with us   this day in the Camp of Israel and   my prayer to God is that they may   remain with us and our Posterity  through all time and through all   Eternity and that the same blessings   may spedily go to the Lamanites   and that 1847 may not pass   away untill the Lamanites with   their Chiefs may begin to recieve the   gospel which the gentiles have reject-  ed and cast out of their midst and   that the Lord will spedily deliver   us entirely out of their hands and   avenge the spilt blood of the Prophets   and that they may cease to spoil and   be spoiled and that they may feel   the chastning rod of the Almighty   and know there is a God in Israel     
 AD. 1846 has been a day of   the sacrafice of the Church of   Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints   Through the fatigues and labours   & exposers of the Saints many have   been laid in the grave I have my-  self been called to part with  two of my sons which God hath   given me they lie in the dust untill  the ^resurrection^ and I came nigh being killed   by accident by the fall of a tree   which broke my breast bone and   three ribs but through the great   goodness of God I was preserved   and have recoverd and still live   for which I feel to render the   gratitude of my heart to my   Heavenly Father and I pray my   Heavenly Father to lengthen out my   days to behold the House of God stand   upon the tops of the Mountains   and to see the Standard of Liberty   reared up as an ensign to the nations   to come unto to serve the Lord of Hosts   I Pray that my Brethren the Twelve   may be preserved to esstablish Zion   upon the mountains of Israel and   lead the Camp of Israel to a land of   Peace, health and safety all these   blessings I ask God my Heavenly Father   in the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue   of the Holy Priesthood AMEN

 N. Y. Citty Dec. 6th 1840    Dear Willford    I presume you will be somewhat surprised   when you learn where this letter was written but perhapse not more   than I was when I went to my door in Iowa and saw brother   J. F. Carter and L. Scammans ride up to the door I could hard think   it possible that they could be there but truly strange things happen in   these last days, they came on to see the country and stoped with me about   6 days and insisted on my accompanying them home and spending the   winter at home and then if I wished I could return with you in   the spring so we left Montrose on the 16 of Nov. and arrived here yester-  day we have had a good and safe passage thus far and tolerable good health.   our dear little babe was some unwell two or thre days with the chills and   fever but I procured some of the tonic mixture and gave him and it helped   him so he is quite smart now. My health is good accepting some cold occasioned   by traveling. I hope to be comfortably situated in my fathers house before you re-  ceive this as we expect to leave here tomorrow for Maine. We are now at   brother Iluse's he has got a verry pleasent girl for a wife about 18 years old.   You told me in your last communication that you was going to send me   some money and wished me to spend it in some ^the^ way that would make me   the most comfortable so I thought that way would be to go home and spend   the winter with my relatives hope to see you in Maine in the spring   I packed up my things and left them at father Clarks where I have been living   and left them in their care with my heifer the cow I let a widow woman have   for her milk she is to keep her for her milk untill my return. I have not heard   from you since last july or your letter was dated th 6th of July where in you   mentioned brother Turley's return home and mentioned writing and sending  me some things by him he had not arrived when when we left but was   expected daily as we heard he had left N.Y. with his company for Montrose  but it was getting so late in the season that we dared not wait any longer   so I borrowed 15 dolls. of sister Taylor and told I saw and engaged sister  Kimbal to take charge of the things you sent until our return and to pay 
 pay sister Taylor the sum of money I borrowed of her if you sent   any and left word to have your letters forwarded to me in Maine I feel   verry anxious to hear from you more so since you went to London.   I feel verry thankful that the Lord has blessed you in your ministry in the   maner that he has since you have been gone from home but Oh! how long   you have been gone sometimes my heart almost sinks within me when I   think how long you have been gone and the scenes that I have passed through   since you left me and was I to dwell upon it I should sink beneath it  but hitherto the Lord has supported me. do tell me when you think   you will be at home the next time when you write if you camn I   often get quite impatient weighting your return. Could I have taken   our little Sarah east with me it seames as though I should have been   happy but Ah! I had to leave her remains in Commerce while I went   east with my little Willy but not without first visiting her grave and strew  ing it with leaves, but I leave this subject. The church in Commerce   and Iowa is increaseing verry fast som some things are taking place in   the church which are bad but bu I will tell you more about it when  you come home which I hope and trust will be in the spring and   hope you will be prepared fo with meanes to take me back in the spring ^with you^   although I expect my friends will be opposed to my going back and   that was the greatest and only objection that I had to going home perhapse   they may change my mind upon the subject but I hope not. I want you to   write often for I think you do not feel as lonely as I do. Father Clark's   family have been verry kind to me ever since I have been there and they   wish to be remembered to you. I have sent you as many as eight or nine   letters since Iyou left N.Y. and paid the postage on them to N.Y. I feel verry   sorry that you do not get them. I have not received any papers from you   in Eng. should be much pleased to read them hope you will bring a coppy   of them home with you and some hymbooks. I have lately received a letter   from sister Eunice they were well—father Carter's family are well—   I should be glad to call on father Woodruff's family as I go along but   shall not have time as it is so late in the season. I should be glad 
 to see see some of the Saints here in N.Y. but have no oppor  tunity to call on them neither should I know where   to find them. I must write a line to sister Eunice   so that I must close by wishing to be remembered by Willford    to all the American brethren and all the Saints around   you likewise particularly brother Kingstons family I should   be glad to fill this sheet but cannot for want of room  time. Do remember wme and Willy in all your pray[ers]    So good night my dear W.    P. W. Woodruff    Willford Woodruff    I suppose you have no objections to my   comeing east I was advised to do so by many

 Vinalhaven March 1st 1838    Beloved Willford    According to your request, I seat myse  lf this eve. to pen a few lines to you after haveing just, returned from father  Luces' (where I have been spending a few days) to brother Amese's. I passed by  brother Stephen Luces' where the brethren have met for meeting—thinking  I would spend the time in writing to you. Brother Ball arrived here  last eve. and brought me a billet from you to day which I was glad  to receive. The church here are strong and well engaged likewise the  opposers are engaged to. Mr. Carter has held two mock meetings here of late,  he has a written manuscript which he has been collecting through the  past winter from newspapers &c which he reads to the people with  hymns addapted to the occasion. brother Ames and Valentine attended the  first meetting and bore a noble testimony for the truth they said  they never had so much liberty in speaking before, many people saw  the contrast between the two spirits—but none of the brethren attended  the last meeting. I have received three letters for you but no papers; one letter  was from Mother  Woodruff bearing date of Dec. 31st wherein in she says  that she has been quite sick but has far recovered also that Eunice and father  were well and that her faith was encreaseing in the faith of latter Day Saints  and that nothing short of it would satisfy her mind &c. &c.—another from  brother Asahel wherein he acknowledges the reception of your last  letter—his remarks are more favourable than than sometimes—says that  he heard brother Joseph preach in Terra Haut last fall &c.. The third  was from brother Milton he mentions that your much esteamed letter  came to hand and was gladly received—he had concluded almost that you  had not received his—he likewise received one from Kirtland the same day  dated Jan. 14th wherein he received information concerning matters in K. he 
 requests you to let no one but me know of it—he writes in confidence to you—says that  Joseph and Sidney took their families Saturday night and it is supposed they  have gone to Missourie and the word is for all to follow that possibly can to  escape the destruction that is comeing upon K. There is a great division there and  a number have left the church and raised what they call a standard of truth  and liberty and drew up a remonstration against wickedness and the pro  cedings that have been illegally, takeing for their guide the book of Mormon the  bible the and covenants for their guide. I will mention some of their names  N. Milliken and wife, John Gayland and wife, W. Parish and wife, J. F.  Boynton and wife Martin Harris and wife, Leonard Rich and wife, Joseph  Coe and wife, Sarah Lowell, and Aphia, and many others but I hope not  Willford and Phebe—there was about thirty five that signed the remon  strance, but the letter stated that there was thousands of the same opinion.  The high counsil met and cut them all of from the church. Doct Cowd  ry has withdrawn from the church, the printing office has been taken and sold  for Joseph's and Sidney's debts N. Millikens bid it off, therefore we shall not  have the papers at present. I am verry sorry for that for there is much eccitem  ent [excitement] here already about the delay of the papers and I suppose that they have the same  account here in the papers that you saw, some of them have already written to  the Post Masters in Cleaveland and Kirt. to learn the truth of these things although  it is kept private here now. O Willford what is this world comeing to. my heart almost  shrinks within me when I look around on the state of things. Brother Ball  has received a letter from his Mothers family in Boston requesting him to return  to them and he thinks of starting in 8 or 10 days. I rather expect that he will  baptize Mr. Ephraim Luce and Lucy Fry as they have been waiting for an oppo-  rtunity most ever since you lelft. Brother Ames has had his case tried and the cost  was trown upon him. Mr Douglass has been in a great rage about you he says  that he will spend all his property in law with you but that he will have his  character cleared up, he has applied to two Justices for an execution against you but 
 but they told him that it was between ministers and they did not wish to meddele  with it, but brother Crocket has come over to this district and says that he is more  calme than he was. I really hope that he will not procede with his suit for it will  only make trouble. I have almost forgotten to tell you that Milton has given up going  to Kirt. next spring and wants to come down here in the spring—wants to meet you in  Scarborough thinking that you will accompany me there in the spring he wants you  to write to him, says that he wishes he was with you here now. Brother and sister  Ames Valentine and Melana send there best respects to you and say they are trying to  do as well as they can. I think they are. Sister Brown and sister Sabra are here on  a visit and send there love to you and say that the church is doing well there.    They have just come in from meeting and say they have had a verry good  meeting, that brother Crocket was wide awake. You did not say any thing about  the time that you expected to return here, your three weeks have almost expired  and they have been long enough I think. I realy feal lonely here without my [page torn]  but I trust that the Lord will take care of him and return him to me in  his time. I dont forget to ask him to daily and trust that I am not forgotten  by him. My health is good at present but I have been quite sick with a cold  I was much pleased to hear that brother Townsend had joined your company  Give my best respects to him and tell him that I want to see him.    Milton's letter was sealed with black and there was greate enquiery concerning  the contents, but I did not let them know of the Kirtland affairs, some of them  here surmise that a mob has arisen and demolished the press in Kirtland  if but I shall keep the letter private untill you come and then you may  do as you think best with it. I think that these times will try the faith  of the saints but I think that I feael as strong as ever. C There will be  great persecution for thes things but there is a God in Israel yet thanks be  to God for it. I have not commenced your coat yet but shall soon. I recollect  that this is your birthday would be glad to congratulate you upon the same could I have  the privilege. This is from your Phebe who is waiting as patiently as she can for your return.  It is most twelve therefore I bid you good night and retire to rest    P. W. W.

 Kirtland Geauga County Ohio Nov 29th 1836    Brother Asahel H. Woodruff    Dear Sir    As I have   just taken my pen from a sheet directed to our Distant  parents I thought pirhaps it would not be amiss to  address a few lines to you as I have never had any reason to  believe that you had lost that friendship or attachment towards  me that I formerly have been made the partaker of an opportunity  afforded. Notwithstanding years have rolled away between us since  we saw each other face to face yet my attachment towards you  or my desire for your wellfare either in temporal or spiritual things  hath not either lessoned or abated. It certainly is gratifying to   me to hear of the prosperity of my Brethren in evey lawful  pursuit Brother Asahel I have long felt anxious to again  hear from you I am sensible that it is not alltogether profitable to   be always pouring upon any ones mind any subject however good  it may be lest be be weary in consequence of which I have remained  more silent upon those subjects in which I have been ingaged than I  otherwise should have done. But thinking perhaps you would like to  Know whare I was how & what I was doing I concluded to call your  mind to the perusal of this sheet. I would here rema^r^k that after  our last conference in the south I spent a few days in visting the   Churches which God had rased up by my instrumentality in that country  I had a good season amo[n]g them I added 9 to their numbers &  took the parting hand I took water at Paducah K.Y. on the 25 th of   Oct after passing one boat that had sunk & run aground ourselv[es]  traveled 400 miles we reached Luisville I then went by land to Owenton,  & spent two weeks preaching & visiting some Kinsman of Elder   Snoots a travling Brother from Tenne who is with me we then went  to Cincinnati visited the big bone lick on the road the place whare  those large bones are taken that have been exhibited in Europe &  America. When I arived at Cincinnati My first business was   to inquire at the store of Webster & Conway for you they told  me you had located at Terrehaute Indianna & I was glad to learn  from them that the prospects for your prosperity was flattering 
 Cincinnati is much of a place of business I sayw while there the Dead & wounded  taken from the Flora caused by the bursting of the connecting pipes I took water   at Cincinnati for Wellsville rising of 400 miles I also passed another boat  that had run against a snag store her hull & sunk at Wellsville I took  the stage to Kirtland 90 miles & whene I arived at Kirtland I was almost  asstonished I at the alteration in the place since I was there in May  1834 for when I left there was but few buildings & most of them shanties  but now on my returen I fou^n^d a city as it were arising from the hills  & dales & a temple standing in its midsts with its steeple pointing  towards heaven in honor of that God who commanded it be built  & framed the materials of which it was made. It was truly a happy  season to my soul to again meet the inhabitants of Kirtland those with  whom I had endured perils & tribulations I visited the house of the lord &  its contents & I saw that which I did not expect to behold in my generation  & among these things I say the Egyptian mummies & also the Book of   Abram written by his own hand in ancient form. On last sabbath  I had the privelege of going up to the house of the Lord in Kirtland to   worship with my Beloved Brethren I kno not ownly had the privilege of  hereing the word of God in company with about 1,000 Saints from the  sacred desk but also of declaring the word of God unto them. my happiness  hath been great to behold the work of God in these last days & Allthough  the gentiles rages & the priest imagin vain things yet the work of God will roll on  in spite of all these things untill babylon shall fall Israel be gathered & Christ  reign    I am mow about to commence a cours  of study perhaps shall enter school on the morrow what length of tim[e] it  will take me to accomplish it I am unable to say I may spend the private  part of my time for several years in this place. I intend to leave school in  the spring a sufficient time to visit my parents & frends in the east & proclaim  the gospel unto them I expect to spend the ^ensuing^ summer in Connecticut I  am perfectly reconciled with my lot in life I never enjoyed myself better in  life than at present. I am now experiencing what I have looked for several  years ownly the blessings of God are greater than I ever expected to   behold. enjoy or even hear from in my generation if you ever  travel through this county I desire you to visit Kirtland once more as  I understood yesterday by Elder Johnston that you called upon him  in this place & inquired for me I supposed at It was a year or     
 two since I would have been glad to have seen you I  hope the day may come when you may have the privelege  of fully investigating the cause in which I am engaged for  I believe your honesty & dissermment would lead you  to imbrace it I have found one thing to be true that  when we seek first the Kingdom of God all things els mecessary  will be added. I should consider it one of the greatest blessings  on earth to have you & the rest of my Kinsman become  members of the Church of Latter day Saints & why I   desire it is because I know it to be the true Church  of Christ & my friends would be exhalted before  God & receieve blessings that fadeth not away I certanly  could have no motive to desire my friends to receieve  darkness or error But I certainly have a chance [&]  know the reality of these things as well at least as those  who are out of the Church & not been privileged  with as closan close an inspection as myself yea & even  our enemies in this county are beginning to acknowl[edge]  of a truth it is in vain to raise their hands against [page torn]  great ene[mies] await us I would to God my friends were [page torn]  for them this world is passing the things of time are transitory  the things of the Celestial Kingdom [a]re eternal & worth possessing  I desire to meet you there. My hart hath also been much  penetrated for Brother Azmon I have loved that Brother I love   him yet I shall still plead before God for him I have  no other than the best of feelings towards him Although I am  ignorant of his feelings towards me the Lord knows I wish  all of my relatives well & if they knew what I know ^not wishing to boast^ they would  be up & doing but as it was in the days of Lot & Noah so will it  be when Christ apperars. [##Matthew 24:37##] Is it possible that I cannot have a   natural Brother [to] partake with me the glory of God in these   last Days I have thought the former Dealings of God with you  was preparing you for theis great work I trust time will yet  proove it to be so I shall pray for it at least write to me when  convnent Direct to Kirtland Ohio (this place) if you have  opportunity call & see me it would be a great privelege to me  yours with the best of feelings & wishes    W.

 Bowery 88. New York City, Dec. 13th. 1839.    My Dear Phebe.    Notwithstanding I sent you a long letter about  twenty days since; I feel disposed to address you at this time; & could I  but read a letter from you half as often as I write to you I should feel  exceding thankful: but I make allowances for Sickness & miscarriage  of letters &c. I have recieved one letter from you & that was great consola-  tion to my feelings. This is the fifth letter I have written to you & I  do hope that you have obtained them, the last letter I wrote Nov 24th which  I truly hope you will get. When you write to me please be particular to  tell me how many of my letters you have received & the dates of them. I  am in great hopes that I shall have a letter from you before I leave the  City for the City England. I never more highly prised the worth of letter writ  ing than since I left home. I suppose of course that you wish to know how  matters & times are with me & have been since I last wrote &c. I continued  preaching in New Jersey, had full congregations, many were believing, some   were embracing, & a warm & friendly feeling manifest by almost the whole  country whare I was. Elder P. P. Pratt called to see us, preached one, &  informed me that a conference was appointed in New York City on the  12th inst & wished me to attend I have done so & am now in the City.  "the following I copy from my Journal. Dec 11th I took the parting hand with Elder James  & Brother Ivins & left them at 1 o'clock at night & rode 16 miles to Freehold. I  there took Stage at daylight & rode 12 miles to Middletown point, there took  Steem Boat Wane sailed 30 miles to N. Y. City arived at 12 oclok. I entered the city  "& found it full of armed Soldiers spedily preparing for war thee Steem Boats  were chartered to conveyed them to Albany to fight several thousand Du-  Dutchman that ware citizens near Albany that had strongly fortified themselves  with canon & small arms, it is said they will not pay their tokens or depts or  sumthing or other of that kind, & so they are going to fight about it, how much  "Blood will be shed I dont know. at any rate it is beginning to be war & sum  "our through America & Europe & all things are in commotion. After dining  in King stret, I called upon Elder P. P. Pratt in Mott street No 58 found him & fam-  ily well. Elders P. P. Pratt & J. Ball accompayed me to the post office. I received  two letters one from Eunice all well in Farmington. one from Milton Holmes  he had been quite sick, lost $70 dollars, was very poor, had no decent  clothes, could not go to England, hardest times he ever saw, could not get  a dollar in money, but was gaining in health, was strong, in faith, urged me  to remember him to Phebe &c. &c. I did not get a letter from Phebe but took  one out for Orson Pratt from his wife in Montrose I gave the letter to 
 parley for Orson & she said in her letter that Phebe & Sarah were getting  better, so Brother Pratt told me. You may be assured those words were  precious to me, for I dreamed a few nights before that Sarah was dead but I thought  the dream might not be true, but come though multitude of business  & though. I returned & took supper with Elder Pratt, he has got a good wife she  often speaks of you, the whole family has had the fever & ague in the City but  have got well. I attended meeting at candlelight in Grand Street in the  Columbian Hall which the Saints have higherd hired to hold their meeting in, it  is in the most popular part of the city, rent $9 dollars per Day Parley gave  us a lecture upon the origins of the Indians & Book of Mormon. I had  the happy privilege of taking Brothers Taylor & Turley once more by the  hand & found them well, truly the mercy of God has been great unto  us all. B. Young & H. C. Kimble was in the state of N. Y. expet them  in the city every day. After meeting Elder Taylor accompanied me to my  boarding place in King Street & we retired to rest. Distance of the Day. 60 m  Thus ended the business of the 11th Day of Dec with me. Yesterday I called  upon Ilus at his Store 118 Bleacker Street corner of Woster I found him  well & in good spirits. he had recieved a letter from Father, Mother, Ezra,  Shuah, & Sister Foss since I last saw him all well in Maine  but exceding hard times. Last evening I sat in conference  at Elder P. P. Pratts house in Mott street 58. the conferenc was called in  conference consequence of an improper course persued among the churches by  Elder Joseph Ball & Richards we did not get through last evening  but meet for the same purpose this evening. The work of the Lord is still  progressing in this country. Parley is labouring faithfully in this City both  in public speaking & printing. he has already out of the press 2,500  of the voice of warning. 2,500 of the persecution of the Saints will  soon be out in bound volume, 2,500 of the Book of Mormon I  expect will soon go to press & also he has other works in the press the  work is not ownly progressing in this City. but a great work is opening  in the City of Philadelphia 30 or 40 have been baptized mostly under  the laboursers of B. Winchester & hunders [hundreds] are believing Brother Winchester  wished me to call & labour awhile with him & I should have done  so If I had not been suddenly called to this City to have attended this con  ference. Elder O. Pratt has gone to hold a protracted meeting 30 miles  from phila[delphia] with Elder Barns I was informed last evening that  that had baptized about 40 during the meeting. & their are many calls for  labourers. &c. The Elders here all wish to be remembered to you & to their  families as far as you have oppertunity to inform them Elder Turley is  writing a letter to his wife on the same table with me. Remember me 
 to all the Saints in Lovely Street, Montrose, & Commerce as far as  they inquire. Brothers Young, Kimble, Taylor, Turley, Hadlock, &c. went to  Kirtland & spent some time there & they say they would not like to have  their family is there for they think it harder times than it is in the west to get  a living. Perhaps our friends in the West may wonder at our tarrying on  this continant so long but the reason in short is the want of means  to pay our fare to England we have had much to struggle with. We  left home without purs or scrip, & sick & feble but through the great  mercy of God we have all been able to reach New York but we all  arived here nearly penny less but as I have been out into the country the  Lord has put into my hands means sufficient to pay my own fare, but  I feel equally interested in the wellfare of my Brethren that they also may have  means to go on my their way as well as myself. I know the enemy has struggled  hard to prevent the Twelve from filling this mission. Will he finally prevail  No God forbid, we are determined to soon stand in England if we go their  through the greatest perils. Yes I say in the name of the God of Israel I will  lift up my voice in England in preaching Jesus Christ & him crusifed & cry repent-  anc to that people & that spedily to, for the spirit of God is like fire shut up i[n] [paper torn]  my bones & rolling as with electricity though my spirit crying Haste Haste [paper torn]  they know not what awaiteth them.

I  went down to the fire with Joseph Ball about 9 oclok in the evening We  tarried untill about 12 & returned home & left the fire still raging, & notw-  ithstanding it rained hard their was about 10,000 persons at the fire. When  we got home we were well soaked with water. Orson Pratt is still  preaching in Philadelphie or near it. Brothers Young, & Kimble are  in this State but have not come to the city yet. I expect all  three of them, & G. Smith & probably brother parley will soon follow  us to England. I expect Brother Taylor will write to his wife before  we leave the city, give my respects to her, & all who inquire. P. P. Pratts  family are well, Sister Pratt speaks often of you. Joseph, Sidney, & Higby  I understand are in the destrict of Washington may the Lord help them  to do his will.    I hope Phebe you will feel easy concerning me &  give me your prayers.

I remember you by day &  by night. I pray the Lord that he may ever give you friends to assist  you in your domestic affairs to assist you both in & out doors  when you are not able to attend to them yourself. But thank God the  day of trial, persecution, & sacrafice, will soon be exchanged for the reward  of the just & that rest which remains for the people of God.

 [Deseret Weekly News, March 6, 1897, 366.]    THE DESERET WEEKLY.    [Column 1]    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S BIRTHDAY.    BIOGRAPHICAL.    On Sunday, February 28, 1897, at 2  p. m., and on the following day, Mon-  day, March 1, at 10 a.m., were exer-  cises in the Tabernacle in honor of the  ninetieth anniversary of the birth of  Elder Wilford Woodroff, President of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints, and one of the first com-  pany of Utah Pioneers that entered  the valley of the Great Salt Lake.    For this occasion the Tabernacle  has been beautifully decorated.  The speakers' stands are ornamented  in white and old gold, with numerous  flowers and potted ferns and other  plants and around the organ. The  table at the foot of the stands is covered  with flowers, and in front of this seats  are raised above the floor for President  Woodruff and wife to occupy during  the reception on Monday. Over this  is a canopy draped with the Stars and  Stripes, with electric lights in the top  to throw light upon the couple. This  canopy will remain thrown back upon  the table until the time of the recep-  tion. The upper stand, which will be  occupied by the President and his  wife during the rendering of the pro-  gram, has been raised about sixteen   inches higher than its usual posi-  tion so that a full view can be   had of them from every part of the  building. In front of and near the top  of the organ is a beautiful star com-  posed of sixty-one electric lights; over  this and extending from south to  north across the building is a white  streamer bearing the inscriptions  "Glory be to God," "Honor to His   Prophet," and the three dates, 1807,  1847, 1897. Around the gallery boot-  ing is stretched, with a star over each  post, and at the rear of the building is   the inscription, "We honor the man  so honored of God." Above the rear of   the gallery is a banner on which is   painted 1847-1897. Below this is a  Union flag which passed through the   war.    Herewith is a brief sketch of Presi-  dent Woodruff's long and eventful life,  furnished by himself:    I was born March 1, 1807, at Northing-  ton, part of the Farmington (now Avon),  Hartford county, Connecticut. In  my early life I worked as a farmer  and miller. Of course my childhood  was passed under the influence of the   remnants of the Blue Laws of Con-  neticut. I remember the day well   when the Baptists and the Methodists  in Connecticut were almost as un-  popular as the Mormons afterwards  became. Presbyterians and Congre-  gationalists were the ruling religions  of New England in my childhood.  In attending Sunday school in my  early boyhood, under Dr. Noah Porter,  and learning chapters of the Bible  by heart, I saw what Jesus Christ and   the Apostles taught. Those principles  were so firmly imprinted on my mind  that I could never join any church,  because the churches of that day did  not believe them, until I heard Zara  Pulsipher, a Mormon Elder, preach to  me and my brother Azmon, and a   large congregation of neighbors, at  Richland (now Dansville), Oswego  county, New York, on the 30th day of  December, 1833. On hearing the first  sermon I and my brother Azmon were  convinced, and we went forth and    [Column 2]  were baptized on the 31st of Decem-  ber, 1833.    I went in Zion's camp, in the spring  of 1835, to Missouri, to the assistance  of our people who had been driven  out of Jackson county. Very few of  the members of that Camp are living  today. That thousand miles' journey  with the Prophet Joseph Smith was to  me a school of experience that I shall  never forget in this world or the world  to come. When the Prophet returned to  Kirtland with most of his company I  remained in Clay county, Missouri,  until the 13th of January, 1835, when  I left Lyman Wight's, in company  with Henry Brown, to go on a mission  to the Southern states. We passed  through Jackson county, Missouri, and  through Arkansas, and from Little  Rock to Memphis, Tennessee. I spent  two years in Tennessee and Ken-  tucky. While there I was ordained to the  office of an Elder under the hands of  Warren Parrish, and afterwards a  member of the Second quorum of the  Seventy, under the hands of David  W. Patten. I ordained A. O. Smoot to  the office of an Elder in 1836, and he  traveled with me through Kentucky  and Tennessee, and accompanied me  to Kirtland in the fall of that year. I  organizd four branches of the Church  in Tennessee and Kentucky.    In 1837 I traveled through part of  Canada, New York, Massachusetts,  Connecticut and Maine and Fox  Islands. During that mission I bap-  tized several hundred persons and  organized five branches of the Church  in Connecticut, Maine, and Fox Is-  lands. In January, 1837, I was ap-  pointed to the First quorum of Seven-  ties.    In 1838 I traveled on three islands of  the sea and in twelve states of the  Union, established three preaching  places and organized one branch of  the Church in Farmington, Conn.,  with nine of my relatives, including  my father's house.    On the 26th of April 1839, myself  and George A. Smith were ordained  to the Apostleship, on the Temple cor-  ner at Far West, Missouri. The same  year I crossed the Atlantic ocean in  company with John Taylor, to Eng-  land, spending the next year there with  the Twelve Apostles. First I went  to Staffordshire and organized three  branches. Then I went to Hereford-  shire, Worcestershire and Gloucester-  shire, where, in eight months, I  brought 1,800 souls into the Church,  including 600 of the United Brethren,  who had broken off from the Wes-  leyan Methodists, with forty-five  preachers, baptizing all of that sect  but one member. I established three  conferences and fifty-eight preaching  places, and organized forty-seven  branches of the Church.    I then went to London with Heber  C. Kimball and George A. Smith.  We organized the first branch of the  Church in that city, consisting of  eighty-five members.    In 1841, I traveled over 7,000 miles  through England, Wales and parts of  the United States, with the Twelve  Apostles, to attend to the affairs of the  Church.    I spent most of 1842-3 in Nauvoo, at-  tending to the printing office and other  business. An important year was 1844,  in which the Prophet Joseph Smith and  his brother Hyrum were killed. That    [Column 3]  year I traveled over 10,000 miles in  Canada and the United States, visit  ing the churches, attending meetings,  etc. In the fall of the year I was ap-  pointed to go to England to pre-  side over the British mission, setting  sail at New York December 7th, and  arriving at Liverpool January 4, 1845,  during which year I traveled in Eng-  land and Scotland, presiding over the  churches, published 3,000 copies of the  Doctrine and Covenants, and secured  the copyright of the same in London.    In 1846 I returned from England to  the United States, and gathered with  the Saints at Winter Quarters on the  Missouri, where I spent the winter.    On the 7th of April, 1847, I  left my family and friends at  Winter Quarters and traveled  with President Brigham Young and  the Pioneer company of 143 men, a  thousand miles across the plains into  the midst of the Rocky Mountains,  arriving in the valley of the Great  Salt Lake on the 24th of July. We  laid out Great Salt Lake City and built  a fort around ten acres. President  Young and some others of us returned  to Winter Quarters the same season.    In traveling across the plains, for  three days and nights, we met an al-  most endless number of buffalo, going  to their summer ranges to break up  into smaller herds to feed in the Platte  country. They were so numerous that  we could scarcely |find| our way through   them.    In the spring of 1848 I took my  family and returned to Boston, Mass.,  spending the rest of the year and also  1849 in traveling through the New  England states and part of Canada,  gathering up most of the Saints re-  maining there and sending them to the  Rocky Mountains.    On the 9th of April, 1850, with my  family and about a hundred other  Saints, I left Boston, and with steam-  boats, railroads and wagons again  traveled to the Rocky Mountains,  where I arrived on the 14th of October,  having traveled 4,617 miles.    From 1851 to 1877, twenty-six years,  I spent mostly in Utah, traveling and  preaching considerably among the  Saints, and also otherwise fulfilling  the duties of my calling as one of the  Twelve Apostles.    President Young died August 29,  1877, John Taylor succeeding him as  President of the Church.    From 1877 to 1887, during the Presi-  dency of John Taylor, I spent most of  my time traveling, preaching in Utah  and Arizona, and laboring in St.  George temple for the salvation and  exaltation of the living and the dead.  When John Taylor was accepted as  President of the church, October 10,  1880, I became president of the  council of the Twelve Apostles.    President Taylor died July 25, 1887,  and it fell to my lot to succeed him in  presiding.    I was accepted as the President of  the Church April 7, 1889, with George  Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith as  my counselors, since which time I  have endeavored to attend to the du-  ties of that office to the best of my  knowledge and ability.    I was appointed assistant historian of  the Church in 1855, and historian in  1881. Franklin D. Richards was sus-  tained as my successor in that office  April 7, 1889. 
 40 Ironmonger Row St Lukes London F 12 1841    Elder G. A. Smith    Beloved Brother    The last letter   you wrote me you wished me contained a request  for Elder Kimball to Write you a letter, & send  you the news from his Wife. Elder Kimball has  also Recieved your letter directed to us under  Date of Feb 4th He intended to have answered your  request before this time but, having been   vary busy, he said to me this morning (as  he was going to Woolwich with Elder Snow)  I wish you would write to Brother Smith  so according to his request I feel disposed to  drop you a few lines. I received a letter  to day from you to Elder Snow, in which  you also speak of some of the unpleasant  difficulties which you have to settle in the  Churches truly such things are disagreeable  & my prayer is that the Lord will give  you Wisdom & council in evry time of  need & grace according to your day in  all things. As to news from America I dont   know that we have any thing exept what you  have heard. A letter came here for Elder Young  from his wife which we sent to him. She heard  that Joseph was about to write to Br Young for the  Twelve to come home in the Spring, &c.  Elder Snow arived here last evening from Birmingham 
 And Elder Wm Pitt from Ipswich He had  organized a Branch of the Church there of 11  members, ordained a priest & one Teacher, & left  many Believeing.

The people there are determin to hang  him if they can get testimony against him &  if they do it England is determined to have redress  at the cannon mouth, as they consider it by  Order of the Government & not the concern of an  individual parliament has sent special orders to  their Minister at Washington what course to pursue 
 & it is thought it will create an eruption &   War, if so America will learn by experiance  that it is no Joke to have a war with England,  One thing is certain She will find vexation  from some quarter & that spedily.    The late letters from Liverpool indicate a great  Emegration of the Saints 235 sailed in the Sheffield  & 108 on board of Hecho & will sail the last of the  Week.

 Burslem Feb 3rd 1840    Elder W. Richards    Dear Brother    Though I have no extraordinary information  to communicate to you at this time upon any subject, yet I thought I would  drop a few lines to you this morning, & let you know that I am alive &  enjoying good health, & what I am about &c We arived in Manchester the day we  left you, & saw Elder Clayton & the Saints in good spirits. I was much  pleased with my acquaintance with Brother Clayton I consider him a worthy  Brother a man of wisdom & of God. I was called upon in the evening with Brother Clayton  to go & visit that Sister that has been so much afflicted possessed with the Devil &c. I  do not recollect the name. her husband that was considered under Transgression came  to us & confessed his Sins, & next day made acknowledgments before the church.  When we arived at his house his wife was in a great rage required 3 men to hold her  We lade hands upon her & after a mighty struggle cast the devil out & rebuked  the fever & she was made whole & was at meeting comfortable next day, but  the devil entered into her child next, day & flung it into a dredful agony &  made it as stiff as a stake, we lade hands upon it, & the devil instantly came  out & the child fell asleep. I have herd nothing from them of late. We preached with  them on Sunday & had a pleasant time with them. We left Manchester on   the 21st & rode to Burslem, & found Elder Cordon & the Saints well. I found  them meeting with some opposition in Burslem such as getting the candles  & candlesticks flung at their heads while preaching. The rabble generally was lead  by John James. We immediately commenced preaching & opening new doors  as we had an oppertunity. One evening while I was preaching in Burslem John James  came with two constables (to keep the peace for he feared the people) while he could read a   pamphlet exposing Mormonism taking taken from Mormonism unveiled & W. Parrish  letters & P. P. pratts &c. I helped him to read then what I could, by giving him lights, &  water to quench his thirst, & calling for order while the house was hissing at him  when he got though I answered him & the people retired in peace, his opposition 
 has injured him & given us friends. We have held regular meetings on the  Sabbath in Bath Burslem, & Hanely. We now have meetings in Burslem &  Hanly, Stoke, Newcastle, Lane End, & a number of other places, round about  I have been informed that the Rector in New Castle is preaching against us  quite a number of Methodist teachers attend our meetings & freequently oppose  but they go away confounded while it begets us friends. We have quite a good  room in Hanly that we have lived for six months, which will be the sta[n]ding  place for the church to meet in on the Sabbath we have vary full & attentive  congregations how many will come out in this regeion I do not know  but the work seams to be prosperous here as yet, their has been a number  baptized since we came, the Church now Numbers between 70 & 870 &  others given in their names. I became convinced it was the will of God  for one of us to go to Birmingham & taking all things into consideration  we thought it best for Elder Turley to go. & consequently he left Burslem  for Birmingham on the 28th Jan & I suppose is now labouring in Birmingham  but I have not herd from him since he Left. We are determined by the  assistance of God to open a Door in Every town from the Potteries to Bir  mingham & erect a Standard in it. I feel as though it will be a day  of warning & not of many words to England. I think that what we do we  shall do quickly. I would here also remark their are a number of Doors  opening in the towns between the Potteries & Manchester & preast Samuel  Heath & Elder Clark I believe are labouring there. I am enjoying go[o]d health &  spirits & the Saints generally are well, & wish to be remembered to you &  wife Sister Elizabeth Revenscraft sends her respets to you & Sister Richards &  says tell Brother Richards that Mother will not have any more preaching at her  house. I wish you to Remember me to Sister Richards, & the family  where you reside & to Sister's Fielding, & Dawson, & all who inquire. I suppose  I have not had any letters as yet come to Preston. I wish you to drop a  few lines to me after recieving this & inform me of your health & Sister  Richards & about all the Saints & any information that you may have from our  friends in Liverpool or elswhere. I saw a late account in the paper of the destruct-  ion of the City of New Orleans in the U.S.A. by the Mississippi River I do not know 
 whether it be true or not. Please direct your Letter to Wilford Woodruff in care  of Alfred Cordon, club buildings, Navigation Road, Burslem, Staffordshire.    May health, Strength, peace, & grace, rest upon you from God our  Father, & our Lord Jesus Christ that you may be prepared to do the will of  God in all things    W.

 Stoke 11 oclock Saturday night Feb 8th 1840    Elder W. Richards    Dear Brother    A few minutes since while in  a prayer meeting Deacon Bradbury came in & lade two Letters  before me one from you under Date of Feb 7th 1840 & the other was from  Elder Wm clayton Feb 5th 1840 & as my time is now constantly  taken up in the day time, I concluded to write a few lines this eveing  in answer to yours. perhaps you may think that I have not had  time to consider upon your request on your last page sufficient  to express my opinion upon it, but one cause I have for writing  without delay is to inform you of the contents of Brother Clarks  letter which you mailed to him, But perhaps you may have had  it before you will re[c]ieve my Letter He sayes Brothers Joseph & Sidney  has gone to Washington. Brother J. sayes pray for me & I shall come  off conquerer. Brother Mulholland died Nov 14th bro Hilman  Died Nov 19th. Commarce is appointed a Stake of Zion, & Montrose  a Branch. Gov Boggs has landed in Iowey with 1000 men &  sent back for 1000 more. Gov Lucas called out his men.  Brother Clark lossed a youg child 7 weeks old & another sick. Brother  Kimbbal Kimball sick in Kirtland with chills & fever. Letter  Dated Dec 15th 1839 So much from Bro clarks letter. As to news  with us I have nothing very special to say ownly I am stiring the  people up much in this country at the present time Hanly esspecially I  preached thursday night in Hanly to about 400 people & a number of priest  came out armed with ^ivisible^ weapons to give me dreadful battle upon the Book  of Mormon the Lord showed it to me & I preached to them upon the Book  of Mormon & disarmed them of every weapon that they had chosen to fight  me with & it flung them into confusion & they did not wish to leave with  out doing sumthing & so they jumped upon a Bench & raved & hollowed like mad  men untill they were not ownly choaked up but pulled off from the Bench  [by] by the people I gave answers to their hurrang [harangue] as long as I thought it  wisdom & then left the house all in an uproar, I lig like to see 
 some excitement & things are working about right now in the potteries  to have the people hear the word whether they embrace it or not, the priest  are quite mad because we are getting a hold in Hanly we have  a good house to preach in & we have a worthy brother who has rece  ived the work & his doors are opened unto us constantly. he is a Merc-  hant in the place his wife & servent are also members of the Church  We shall have warm opposition in Hanly for it is the seat of  iniquity & pristcraft but the Lord is with us. I preach on the mor  row Sunday in Stoke & Lane End Elder Corden in Hanly. I receved  a letter from Elder Turley on Thursday he was in Birmingham  preaching to his relatives in the family circle. but was soon expecting  to preach in public. he foud hard work to preach to his parents who  had been professors of Godliness 40 years & had great confidence in  their ministers. Brother H. Glover has just returned on a visit to  his friends about 50 miles & some rage & fight otherers want the word  & some wish to be Baptzed. But I will close about matters with  us    Now Dear Brother with respect to your Difficulty that you spoke of  I will acknowledge I have not had time to meditate upon it & pray about it  as much as I could wish but yet the spirit of God knows all things I  am sensible you have many difficulty things to encounter. I do not  know what better you could have done than the course you have persued con  sidering all circumstances, but one thing is certain sumbody is much  out of the way. In the first place I ask in the name of reason & Revelation  that if Sister D is sick what business Sister C or any other person has to accuse  her of feigning herself sick, the principle is of the Devil & the spirit of God bears  record against it. If Sister C had charity & the Love of God in her soul & was  in the way of her Duty she would go & sympathise with Sister D instead  of speaking against her & that to behind her back such things are agaist  the law of God & iniquity cannot be retained in the church of christ or  at least it should not. The church did right in withdrawing the hand of fel-  lowship from Sister C, & she ought not to be restored unless she will make  an humble acknowledgement of her sins & repent of them before God. if others  had sined ever so much it is no place for Sister C to make a bulwark of 
 to shelter her sins behind. Again the principle of finding fault with a  Brother & or Sister & speaking evil of them behind their backs as a sin that  God hates & if it is not repented of it will bring the curse of God upon  the heads of those that are thus guilty. & I believe their is eviel of this  kind in Preston, & their are those in preston that have wrongly accused &  had evil surmisings both towards you & Sister Richards & if they do  not scease from those things & spedaly repent their wickedness shall be  manifest & their eniquity brought to light & they will feel the chastning  hand of God, & I say it in the name of Jesus christ. I know  it is difficult to deal with such cases whare they are all pointed towa  rds ones own self, but I am more & more convinced & that to  by the spirit of God, that the church Will never prosper in preston untill  they treat you in a different manner from what they are doing at least  many of them, they ought to sympathize with you in your afflicti[on]  & assist you to the necessaries of life, & uphold you by love, confidence  pray[er] & faith, it is what God requires at their hand. Brother & Sister  Richards dont be discouraged, the Lord will give you the victory, you  shall overcome & your Enemies shall not prevail against you, I   will plead with God for you, you shall have my prayers if I can  do nothing more. I would say in all cases of Church dealing it  would be well to persue the gospel course & it appears that you have done  & leave the event in the hands of God. & let us ask God for wisdom &  he will give it unto us. My Love to Sister Richards & all who  inquire a letter from you will meet a welcome reception at  any time Dont trouble yourself about the postage it is but a trifle I  I will pay it. excuse the hasty scribling of this sheet. That health, strength,  faith, grace, & evry needful thing may rest upon you from God our  Father & our Lord Jesus christ is the prayer of your Brother in the Love of God    W. Richards W Woodruff

 Leigh, Gloucestershire, England. Sept 12th, 1840.    Elder H. C. Kimball & G. A. Smith.    Beloved Brethern,    I am in the midst   of the saints at the Leigh enjoying good health & spirits. & while   meditating upon the scenes which have transpired with me during the   last 23 days which has been spent with you on a mission in the   City of London, I feel disposed to pen a few of my thoughts on paper for your   perusal. Brethren this is the first mission we have ever enjoyed together in the vineyard. Can   we for a moment say that our time hath been spent in vain during this period? Nay we cannot   the spirit within me forbids it. Have we not profited by this school of experianc? yea much   evry way. While the Lord hath manifested by revelation that it is his will that we should obtain a   knowledge of Kindgdoms & countries, this mission hath placed us in a situation to avail our-   selves of the desired information upon many things that which we could not otherwise  have obtained. Time will clearly show that the late mission which we have enjoyed together  in the City of London (which is still continued by your labours) will ever be firmly engraved   in our minds & occupy an important place, In the history of our travels among the   Nations of the Earth. When London feels the chastning hand of the ALMIGHTY   & in her turn amid the revolutions of the gentile world finds her doom is sealed with her  lofty spires, synagogues, mansion, & pallaces, laid in one common ruin, then with what feelings  shall we address our children or the thousands that may surround us, while our heads  are blossoming with age, as we point to the 21st day of September ^october Aug^ 1840, when we   stood together upon the top of the most splended & highest modern pillar in the Univers &  with the naked eye surveyed the most populous & wealthy city upon the face of the   earth, which we can then exclaim hath been the theater of much misry & wo, but now sleeps  in death. We ^having in my possessin a history of places visited I feel disposed to give the same {that [and may he] give} a correct {account of} the {same} to refer to^ shall not readily forget ^on the 24th oct we visited^ Oct [Aug] 24th while we walked to & fro through St  Pauls Cathedral which was 500 feet in length 285 in bredth 404 in highth which was 40 years  in building from 1675 to 1715 which cost £136000 or $3,680,000 ^£l,567,076,15. $ 5880,380^ which contains   47 monuments of fine marble erected over the Tombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals   Earls & other titles who had distinguished themselves in the military service of Great Brit-  ian & otherwise, Lord Nelsons being the most noted, & while historians have taken much   interest in the origen of this cathedral dedicated St Paul which was first built by St  Augustine in the year 610, & now considered the largest cathedral in the world excepting   the Vatian at Rome dedicated to St Peter. We ^ourselves^ can clearly see the gentiles are zealous in   a form of Godliness while they deny the power thereof, for while this church stands in   honor to St Paul, those who whorship therein utterly reject & deny the principles which   he tought. Again I think we shall not doubt the words of Soloman when he said man had   sought ought many inventions esspecially when we reflect back to the 1st day of Sept, when   We desended together about 40 feet into the Bowels of the earth & walked throught the Thames  Tunnel with the River Thames & British shiping over our heads which was opening a thorough   fare from one shore to the other which was finished 1110 ^feet^ & was lighted with gas, arched   overhead & considered one of the greatest wonders of the last days. The time we spent   together on the 5th of Sept Visiting Westminster Abbey was not unprofitable, had we   travled the world oer we could not have found another spot that would have pre-  sented a wider field of knowledge & of contemplation as touching the history of the   rise, progress, & fall of Kings, Princes Lords & mighty men of Gentile greatness pride   & boast. This Abbey was composed of eleven Chapels (ownly seperated by walls or petitions) 
 Viz 1. St. Benedict. 2. St. Edmund. 3. St. Nicholas. 4. Henry the Seventh. 5. St. Paul.  6. St. Edward the Confessor. 7. St. Erasmus. 8. Abbot Islip. 9. St. John. 10. St Andrew  & 11. St. Michael. & these Chapels contain the Bodies, tombs, & monuments, of of elveven Twelve ^13^  Kings viz Edward I. — III. — V — VI. Charles. II. Henry III. — V. — VII. James I. George II.  Richard II. & William III. & Sebert King of the east Saxons who first built this church   & died July 616 Also Twelve ^13^ Queens viz Athelgoda, Queen of Sebert who Died Sept 13 615  & Phillippa, Matilda. Mary I. — II. & Queen Mary of Scotland, Elizabeth, Catherine,   & Queen Anne & Editha, Eleanor & Caroline & of ^six^ Prince's George, & Eleven ^11^ Dukes, seven ^7^—  Duchess, one ^1^ Marquis, Seven ^7^ Lords, three ^3^ Vicount, Eight ^8^ Countess, three ^3^ Barrons sixteen ^16^—   Earls, eleven ^11^ Admirals, twelve ^ten 10^ Generals, 5 Col, ^3 Majors^ 10 Capt. 4 Lieut. 16 Bishops. 6 Divines  15 Doctors, 52 Sirs. 153 Gentleman, & 48 Ladys, making 421 persons who have been   deposited in vaults in this Abbey & Monuments erected to their memory. Here we had the privilege  of viewing the full stature & perfect likeness of Queen Elizabeth, Mary, & Anne   Lord Nelson, & Pitt & others. We saw the full Coronation Dress of Queen Anne. We   also saw the chair & sat in it, in which Queen Victoria was crowned & all the Kings   & Queens in England for the last 800 years this chair is covered with gold tissue. It   contains a stone under the seat upon which all the Scottish Chiefs, & Kings were crowned   since they were a people it is reported to be Jacobs Pillar which chair has been in use 800  years. In walking through this Abbey we see frequent marks of violence from Oliver Cromwell  in defacing some of the tombs, monuments, & brass work with which some of the Abbey was   adorned. Here we behold the art of man with all its combined force & power spun to the   finest thread, & expanded to the fullest extent in the building & finishing of this Abbey as   a general whole, But more esspecially that part called Henry Sephenth Seventh's Chapel  & a visit to this Abbey is not ownly worthy of the Attention of all travellers but to occupy   a place in the Journal of any Historian.    While speaking upon this subject I would   not pass over our visit to the house of Parliment, on the 8th of Sept. As we entered the   house of Lords (now occupied as the house of Commons) ^we did not behold^ so much to interest the sight of the eye as   the meditation of the mind, however we had the privilege of resting ourselves by siting in the chair in   which the speaker of the house of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the speeches were   made by Mr William Pitt while advocating the American cause, before the Revolution. In this room  all the laws were made that now governs ^from^ 175 to 200 000 000 of human beings. As the house of   commons was burned down about six years since this room at the present time is occupied by ^for^ the   house of commons & there is another house now built which the house of Lords at the   present time occupies. One would naturly suppose that a house of Parliament fitted up to   contained Kings, Lords, & Commons would be sumthing extra, grand, & expensive but we found   it quite the reverse. It is excedingly plain & undecorated. On entering the room one would   sooner think he was in an American school house rather than in a house of Lords or of Commons.  While retiring from this scenery we had a view of the order of British soldiery or foot guards  while on parade in St James' Park, accompanied by a full band of music. Also of the Queens   Horse guard 100 in number well mounted upon fat gay black mares, & the steel with which   their bodies were covered glistening in the Sun. We might make mention of the monument  erected in honour to his grace the Duke of York which was 135 feet in highth & of the   mansion of Queen Dowager widow of the Late King Williams IV which we had a   view of as we past along. In fine St James Park is surrounded as it were with Dwellings  mansions, castles, monuments, & Palaces, of the first class as to size, splendour, & Note of any in   Europe, of which Buckingham Palace is the Chief. this is for the Royal Family & is now 
 occupied by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, & his Highness Prince Albert, except while they  are at Winser Castle. Buckingham Palace Covers a number of acres of ground & is surro  unded by a high wall of hewn stone except the front which is a high fence of cast Iron  railing, & evry door, enterence, & gate was strongly guarded by armed soldiers. I walked   nearly around this castle Palace, & while there I for the first time had a view of his   Royal Highness Prince Albert while he was riding from his palace across St James Park  mounted upon a gray horse accompanied ownly by his groom who was riding a sorrel horse.  I also spent a few moments in the National gallery which was ^is^ not unprofitable to a traveller  desiring to form a knowledge of countries & the art of man. This gallery contains a vary   great & extensive variety of the most Perfect Paintings that could be gathered together   by the Nation, these with other things we have had the privilege of forming a   knowledge of for ourselves. ^But^ Brethren while you discover that I hav written rather   largely concerning these temporal & perishable objects which are in the same state, & doomed to   share the same fate in the revolutions of the last days & the fall of Babylon, as Jerrusalem  did when they rejected their king & put to death the Messiah, think not that I for a moment  harbour the idea that the ownly benefit we have derived in the enjoyment of our late   mission together in the City of London has been a knowledge of these things, far from this.  for while I have spoken of these things while they were in memory more for the purpose  of preserving a historical sketch of the same than other wise, still the remaining part of   the subject rest upon my mind with greater weaight. Yes Brethren our late mission together   has not ownly put us in possession of a knowledge of those things spoken of but it hath   given us a more intimate acquaintance with each other & that to in some degree in the midst  of trials, which acquaintance has had a tendancy if possible to unite our hearts  more closer together in the love of God & the New & Everlasting Covenant. this is   not all. we have stood together in this first mission to the city of London in which   we have had the privilege of uniting our labours in lifting up the standard of truth, of   light, & the fulness of the everlasting gospel, & When on dilligent search we found the whole   city given to Idolitry, Priescraft, tradition, superstition, & all manner of abominations wick-  edness, & uncleanness & all doors closed against us we did not hesitate to stand in   the midst of the streets & Jonah like cry repentance unto the Inhabitants of that mighty   city, The Metropolis of England, the Pride & glory of Britain, the Boast of the Gentiles & the  largest city in the world, containing one million five hundred thousand souls who were   ripened in iniquity, &prepared for the wrath of God, & like the ox going to the slaughter   know not the day of their visitation. Yes Brethren I shall long remember standing in   the midst of that people & assisting you in bearing a message unto them, a message— 
 which will prove a savior of life unto life or of Death unto Death not ownly unto   them, but unto all they unto whom the sound thereof shall come, even of the whole   gentile world & the judgment of the great day shall manifest the truth of it unto all   nations. And it will ever sweeten the memory of that eventful period of my life   to know that our labours on that occasion were not in vain. But that we were   enabled through the great mercy & goodness of God & toil, labour, dilligent search, &   perseverance, to find some of the Blood of Ephraim, a few honest souls that were   willing to recieve & obey the gospel & that we were enabled to lay the foundation   of a work in that City which will not be removed untill the City is warned so that   they will be left without excuse, & the saints gathered out to stand in Holy places   while judgment works. Untill that time the seed which we have sown in that   city & that which you are now sowing shall bring forth fruit & the fruit   shall remain to the honour & glory of God & I say it in the name of   Jesus Christ & the Spirit Beareth record & the record is true. Therefore   Brethren let your souls rejoice, & your hearts be made glad, that we are permitted   to bear some humble part in the sacrafices, sufferings, & reproach of Christ & of   warning this generation & of gathering together the honest in heart & the meek  of the Earth that they with us may stand together in Holy places while judgement   works ^works^, & be prepared to enter into that rest which remaineth for the People of   God. And Dear Brethren my prayer to God is that we may ever be meek & humble   that the Power of the Priesthood & the spirit of our ministry & mission may rest upon   us that we may be carried through evry strait Place wherein we are called to walk that  we may keep the faith & overcome the world. I pray my heavenly Father in the name of   Jesus Christ that this may be our happy lot & that we, with all the Elders of Israel, & Saints  of God may be prepared to joyfully meet our Lord & Master when he appeareth again the second   time without sin unto salvation.

It was truly a trial to her to loose  her little girl so sudden & that to in my absence but she  bears it vary well, & feels quite resigned it gave me a sudde[n]  shock when I first saw it in Elder Richards letter but it was but  for a moment. I felt much resigned to it. I have written my  wife a long letter which I sent her yesterday. I was glad to  hear that you & Heber John was comfortable I hope the  Lord will spare your life & the lad to see good days. Sister  Margarett Smoot wrote vary feeling about the death of our  little girl, & Brother Petty seems to think that the Missourians  are much troubled about the 50 men going up to make a  new Settlement.

As soon as I  can make arangments concerning my appointments I  shall leave for Hereferdshire or any other place the Twelve   think best, or tarry whare I am as may be thought  Wisdom. Elder Curtis Writes from Ireland for  some council concerning his coming into some  part of England if you have any council for him I  presume it would be vary excptable. I am sorry to hear  that Doct L Richards is so much out of health please  give my respects to him. I should truly be happy to  have an interview with him which I trust I shall  be privileged with some day. I was truly glad to hear  from cousin Lemuel. I hope the Lord will bless  him my respects to Sister's Richards & Pratt & all who  inquire. We have an article in this weeks Dispatch here  in London against us & the Bishop & Ministers of the 
 Of the Diocease in Gloucester it is mostly taken from  a pamphlet written by Capt D. L St Clair who declairs to  his own knowledge that we have robed the plundered three  families in Herefordshire & left them in abject poverty one  a respectable farmer has paid to them £200 & two family  in the parish of Bosley have given them evry shilling they  possess & will probably have to go to the union house  having nothing left but the clothse upon ther backs  he equally Blames the Bishop & Ministers in that  region for suffering his people to be so deluded  & thinks the Mormons are wise in there generation  in squ[a]tting upon this Diocese & Baptzing 500 & thinks there  next moove will be to the Diocese of Canterbury the land  of Tomites ceslebrated for its number of Clergy the vast  income of its prelate, & the ignorance of its Christian population  I think of writing the Editor of the Dispatch an Answer  to morrow, but I some question whether he will publish  any thing in our favor.

I attended the High Council in   the evening with the Twelve & Bishops but was quite unwell   with cold and sore throat      21st The following is a true copy of a Revelation given dated   Winter Quarters Camp of Israel Jan 14th 1847      The word and will of the Lord concerning the camp of Israel  In their journeyings to the west      Let all the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day   Saints, and those who journey with them, be organized into companies  with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandments and   Statutes of the Lord our God: Let the companies be organized  with Captains of Hundreds, Captains of Fifties, and Captains of Tens  with a President & his two councillors at their head, under   the direction of the Twelve Apostles: And this shall be our covenant   that we will walk in all the ordinances of the Lord.      Let each company provide themselves with all the Teams, waggons   provisions, clothing, and other necessaries for the journey that they   can. When the companies are organized let them go to with  their might to prepare for those who are to tarry.      Let each company with their Captains, and Presidents, decide   how many can go next spring; then choose out a sufficient   number of able bodied and expert men, to take teams, seeds,   and Farming utensils, to go as Pioneers, to prepare for puting   in spring crops.      Let each company bear an equal   proportion, according to the dividend of their property, in taking   the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the families of those   who have gone into the armey, that the cries of the widow   and the Fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lord against   this people.      Let each company prepare houses, and fields   for raising grain, for those who are to remain behind this season,  and this is the will of the Lord concerning his people; Let every   man use all his influence and property, to remove this people  to the place whare the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion;     
 And if ye do this with a pure heart in all faithfulness, ye shall   be blessed, you shall be blessed in your flocks, and in your   herds, and in your fields, and in your houses, and in your famili[es]  Let my servants Ezra T. Benson and Erastus Snow organize a   company, and let my servants Orson Pratt and Wilford Woodr[uff]   organize a company: Also let my servants Amasa Lyman and   George A Smith organize a company and appoint Presidents   and Captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens:   And let my servants that have been appointed go and teach   this my will to the Saints that they may be ready to go to   a land of peace.      Go thy way and do as I have told you; and fear not thine   enemies; for they shall not have power to stop my work.   Zion shall be redeemed in mine own due time time, and if any   man shall seek to build up himself and seeketh not my council   he shall have no power, and his folley shall be made manifes[t]  seek ye and keep all your pledges one with another and covet   not that which is thy brothers. Keep yourselves from evi[l]   to take ^not^ the name of thy God in vane; for I am the Lord your   God, even the God of your Fathers, the God of Abraham   and of Isaac and of Jacob. I am he who led the children   of Israel out of the Land of Egypt and my arm is streched   out in the last days to save my people Israel cease to contend   one with another. Cease to speak evil one of another.   Cease drunkenness, and let your words tend to edeyfing one   another. If thou borrowest of thy neighbor, thou shalt   restore that which thou hast borrowed, and if thou canst   not repay, then go straitway, and tell thy neighbor lest he   condemn thee. If thou shalt find that which thy neighbor   has lost, thou shalt make diligent search, till thou shalt   deliver it to him again. Thou shall be diligent in preserving   what thou hast, that thou mayest be a wise steward; for   it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art his steward  If thou art merry, praise the Lord, with singing,   with music, with dancing and with a prayer of   praise and thanksgiving. If thou art sorrowful call on   the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may   be joyful. Fear not thine enemies for they are in mine   hands and I will do my pleasure with them. My people   must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to   recieve the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion.  And he that will not bear chastizment, is not worthy of   my Kingdom; Let him that is ignorant, learn wisdom   by humbling himself, and calling upon the Lord his God, that   his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his ears opened   that he may hear, for my spirit is sent forth into the wor[ld]   to enlighten the humble and contrite, and to the condemnation  of the ungodly.      Thy brethren have rejected you and  your testimony, even the Nation that has driven you out; and   now cometh the day of their calamity, even the days of   sorrow like a woman that is taken in travel; and their   sorrow shall be great, unless they spedily repent! ^yea vary spedily^ for they   killed the prophets, and they that were sent unto them,   and they have shed innocent blood, which crieth from     
 the ground against them; Therefore marvel not at these   things, for ye are not yet pure: thou canst not yet bear   my glory, But thou shalt behold it, if ye are faithful   in keeping all my words that I have given you from the   days of Abraham Adam to Abraham; from Abraham   to Moses, from Moses to Jesus and the Apostles and   from Jesus and his Apostles to Joseph Smith, whom   I did call upon by mine Angels, my ministering servants   and by mine own voice out of the Heavens, to bring forth  my work; which foundation he did lay, and was faithful   and I took him to myself. Many have marvelled becaus   of his death, but it was needful that He should seal his tes-  timony with his blood, that he might be honored and   the wicked might be condemned.      Have I not deliverd you from your enemies, ownly in that   I have left a witness of my name? Now, therefore, harken,   O ye people of my church; and ye Elders, listen together  you have received my kingdom, be diligent in keeping   all my commandments, lest judgment come upon you,   and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over   you.      So no more at present Amen and Amen.

 February 15, 1847 ~ Monday      15th I met in council with the President & Council   captains of Hundreds, fifties, and tens, to further  the organization of the Camp of Israel I recieved an   appointment to go to Kegg Creek with Br Smoot to   organize the people ther one of the Chiefs of the Otoes  was present this morning. In the evening I met with   the quorum of the Twelve & others to learn to take the  proper steps in dancing      February 16, 1847 ~ Tuesday      16th I have a vary severe cold & horseness this was one of   the most interesting days of my life I attended the family  meeting of President Brigham Young and he addressed   the meeting at great length during the day and evening   upon many interesting principles. There were present of   the quorum of the Twelve B Young H. C. Kimball   O. Pratt W. Richards W. Woodruff G. A. Smith A Lyman &   E. T. Benson. After singing and prayer by President Young   he arose to address the meeting & remarked that he   had invited the Twelve to be present though they   were not of his family. yet I wish them to act free and   speak such things as the Lord shall give them.      Let me state a principle by which you may contemplate  much. For the want of understanding many have suffered  jealeousies to arise which afflicted theire minds with [borrowed]   troubles and uneasiness fearing the Lord loved some others   more than themselves, this I have sinceeen in the church  ever since its rise. it was manifest in Kirtland when the   first Bishop was ordained this jealeous feeling was manifest  some wondered if the Lord would think enough of them   to ordain them a Bishop Father Morley and others that were  present can bare record of this fact. And when the Twelve  were chosen the same feelings exhisted & in fact I will not   except all of them for some of them manifested the same  feelings when the Bishops were ordained. this spirit has been   the overthrow of many in this church and in fact upon   this principle thousands have fallen in all ages. The Lord   gives to everry man all the power influence and authority   that he can wield in righteousness and all that his goodnes[s]  & faithfulness merits then why should jealousies arise or  what benefit can arise by suffering such feelings to exhist  none at all, but those that cherish such feelings commence  trying to pull down every one that is prospering or gaining   influence as Cain did instead of building up & nourishing   every promising tree & thereby prove himself worthy & show   to his brethren & to God that he loves the cause & by his  passive spirit that he is not ownly willing that others should   should prosper & gain influence & that he actually loves to   see them prosper for then he does all that he can through hims[e]-  lf, he helps advance it through others although they recieve  the honor of it and he still be aware of it such a man will  never be forgotten and to his honor glory and exhaltation there   shall be no end.      There is another principle that has caused   considerable uneasiness and trouble. ie the Idea of some mens having   more wives than one, such tremendious fears take hold of some   that they hardly know how to live still they cant die, begin to     
 whisper and talk around am actually afraid to go on a mission for   fear some man will be sealed to my wife, & when they return   home some will be babbing about, you dont know but what you   have got another mans wife, are afraid to speak to a young   woman for fear that she belongs to somebody els or for fear some  body els wants her. (others deny the faith as they think but they  never had much) and say that it is all of the devil &c such foolish-  nish ought not to be cherished among a wise & prudent people. Admitting   the Lord created the same number of women as men at the begining  and were commanded to multiply & replenish the earth & to fill   up the measure of there creation in righteousness; the question is  did they do it answer No, they soon disobeyed every commandme-  nt & plunged themselves into wickedness and rendered themselves  unworthy to raise up seed unto the Lord & in fact used every means  in there power to cut of[f] life & hinder woman answering the end for  which they were created; nine tenth of them would rebel against the   vary thing he was created to do. Hence you see the propriety of the  Lord's calling upon men who bears the priesthood to take to themselves   wives from among the daughters of men & raise up a righteous seed unto  him that he might fill up the measure of there creation and hasten   the consumation of his purposes in righteousness in this dispensation  according to his words previously spoken through his servents the   prophets. But those who suffer fears & jealouses to aris in there bosoms   either back right out or get to be mighty righteous & for fear that   they are sleeping with other mens wife—they kick up a dust or  broil at home & perhaps abuse there own companion through jealousy   then go off to some woman that does not understand what is right  or wrong & tell her that he has she cannot be saved without a man   and he has almighty power & can exhalt & save her & likely tell that   there is no harm for them to sleep together before they are sealed then   go to some doe head of an Elder & get him to say the ceremony, all  done without the knowledge of the authority of this Church.   this is not right, & will not be suffered. The God I serve will reward   every ^man^ openly without his being under the necessity of going secretly  & privately palming himself on the credulity of innocent ignorant   females. Such jealeousies do exhist & were I to say to the Elders   you now have the liberty to build up your kingdoms one half of   them would lie, swear, steal, & fight like the vary devil, to get men   & women sealed to them they would even try to pass right   by me & go to Joseph thinking to get between him & the Twelve  some have already tryed to used an influence against me. but such  jealeousies & selfishness shall be stoped & if the brethren do not   stop it I will blow it to the four winds by making them all come   & be sealed to me & I to my Father & he and all this church to   Joseph. when I go asstray & give wrong council & lead this people  astray, then is time enough to pull me down & then God will   remove me as he has done all others who has turned from  the faith. But to return, I have gatherd a number of families   around me by the law of adoption & seal of the covenant   according to the order of adoption the priesthood and others   have done likewise it being the means of salvation left to bring   us back to God. but had the keys of the priesthood been retained   & handed down from father to son throughout all generations  up to the present time then there would have been no nece[ssity]   of the law of adoption for we would have all been included  in the covenant without it & would have been legal heirs

 January 9, 1849 ~ Tuesday      9th [FIGURE] I recieved 3 Letters from O. Spencer Dan Jones & W. I.  Appleby And one from Robert Windley All contained good news  capt Dan Jones expresses his feelings in warm terms concerning my  letters to him And says he feels incouraged to go ahead in the name   of the Lord says he has raised up a Branch at Myrtha the Mother   Branch of Britain, over 800 members. And the sum total He   had raised up in that country was represented at the general   conference of Manchester England Aug 14th 1848 amounting to   2747 member. The whole representation at this general confer  ence of England Scotland & Wales was 17902 members 350  branches, 929 Elders 1185 Priest, 608 Teachers 341 Deacons Added   since May 31, 1846, 8467. Elder Orson Pratt is now President   of the Churches in the British Isles and herd the Above reppesenta  tion. Elder Jones Adds I have published in the welch language   48 different kinds And size of pamphlets comprising more  original matter than the Book of Mormon Doctrins & Covenants   & voice of warning, And have circulated one million eight  hundred thousand of Pages all of which preach night And   Day to rich & poor the eternal truths of Mormonism And   cheer the Honest Harted, many learned And some very noted   men have Embraced the work. I have been Enabled to subdue my  foes many of the gifts of the spirit are manifest. one young   man who had been Deef & Dumb 8 years was healed when   coming up out of the waters of Baptism so he both herd   And spake was ordained to the Priesthood And is now pre-  aching the gospel with success. Capt Jones is Adding 150 per month  Elder Spencer writes many good things his is much better says   the work is rolling forth in much Power I have been of late   stiring up the saints to pay their tithing I have visited many  of the conferences for this purpose I feel incouraged to Believe  I shall gather a good sum for the Temple. their Are 4 persons   Expecting to come in possession of large sums of money before I   go to America from them I expect to get several thousand pounds   As tithing to gladden the hearts of the saints in the valley. the Addition   to the Churches continue to be great the Emigration falls much short   of the increase. their may be 1500 saints Emigrate this season but  what is that among so many. O. Pratt thinks it would take 300   ships to carry the British saints at the present time, the hopes  of the wicked Are perishing while looking for better times And ind-  ividuals And Nations both feel like grasping all they can get hold   of Either by fair or foul means. The Papel Crown has At length   fallen. It looks As though the Beastly power of Mobocracy spoken   of in Revelations was likely to destroy the dominion of the Mother  of Abominations spedily. The Emperor of Austria has Adbdicated   and the King of Prussia has called A constitutional government   but the Saints wax vary bold And utter their testimony with   As much assurance in the Holy Ghost. it is truly delightful to  see them pushing sectarian churches And Demolishing human   creeds as so much hay & stubble, the weak are becoming strong  and the Gentiles marvel. You would be asstonished to see the  issue of Books Stars And tracts from the Star office. evry fortne  ight the issue of Stars has doubled since I took charge in   47. And all other works in Equal ratio. The tide of truth   rolls irrisitably through the land. there will soon be some  vary Efficient Preachers in the French Nation from those parts  we Also have A HINDU in this country that speaks more than     
 a dozen different languages Arabic &c &c who is preparing to go  to Asia to Preach the gospel soon. Elder Levi Richards & wife   arived in England safe.

I told Br Rockwood in substance the same   and Pointed out to Br Rockwood whare I believed   it was false. He said he would read it to Br Badlam   before he sent it      January 17, 1849 ~ Wednesday      ^[FIGURE]^ 17th [FIGURE] I recieved two letters from Br Thomas Cartwright   of New York and wrote two letters one to W. I. Appleby  & one to Joseph Henderson of Salem. Elders Rockwood and  Badlam were at my house this day and Br Rockwood read   to me and Br Badlam the letter which he read to me yester-  day, containing charges against Br Badlam He denyed the  charges in toto said they were fals & not true and pointed   out wharein. Br Rockwood herd the explaination and was   convinced he was wrong that it was not wisdom to send   such a document and he said he would leave out those  item out of the letter      January 18, 1849 ~ Thursday      18th Was quite unwell with the teeth Ake      January 19, 1849 ~ Friday      19th Was also unwell to day. Brs A. P. Rockwood & A Badlam   called at my house this day and settelled their affairs in  a friendly manner, Brother Rockwood appeared satisfyed   that the accusations which he brought against Br Badlam   were from a fals representation and not in truth and they   parted in friendship      January 20, 1849 ~ Saturday      20th Brother A. P. Rockwood left for the west to day I  was quite unwell yet in company with Br Badlam I rode  to Salem & spent the night with Br Joseph Henderson 29  Union Street. I was vary sick at night with teeth ake cold   and ague in the face did not sleep at all, during the night  so I had a plenty of time for meditation and among the   subjects before me I reflected upon a Mission that one of the   Presidents of the Seventies presented to the Eastern Branches while  on his mission East to collect funds for building a Seventies  Hall in the valley, why was the mission not signed by Pres-  ident Brigham Young if it was right for such a mission   to be taken, or was it got up to assist the individual in  person more than to build the Seventies Hall, I think it  right and safe to present all missions and business of import  ance before the President of the Church, when they can   be got at 20 miles      January 21, 1849 ~ Sunday      21st Sunday I was still sick through the day my face dbadly   swollen yet I spoke 1 1/2 hours to a small company of the Saints   and spent the night with some English Brethren, but it  was another severe night of paine and affliction I did not   sleep at all. I arose early my face so swollen that I could   scarcely see out of my eyes I had not eaten but little since  I left home, I took the first train of cars with Br Badlam     
 January 22, 1849 ~ Monday      22 [FIGURE] And rode to Boston And Arived home sick And weary  Mrs Woodruff commenced doctering me I took an Emetic   of strong thoroughwert or Boneset tea. I found myself very  Bilious And the tea done me much good Sister Sarah B Foss &  Br Ilus F Carter called upon me to day Br Ilus went on to   New Yourk. Sister Foss stayed with us I recieved one letter   [FIGURE] from Br Henderson. Almon W. Babbit called upon me And   spent the evening And conversed upon A variety of subjects  He had been to Washington And spent A length of time And   Had called to see me And wished me to go to Washington with  him to get An introduction to the members of Congress  in case the Church would wish me to do any business   there another year. He said He had been labouring while   there to so Arange the Territorial Bills As to have A Territo-  rial Government Esstablished in the Great Salt Lake Country   Great Bason North America embracing about 300 miles of  Territory in length called the Utah Territory. He thought   it would ^be^ necessary in order to get it Accomplished for the   inhabitants of the Salt Lake Valley to organize A state Govern-  ment with A Govonor And All repuisite officers And then   let them be Presented to the general government for reception  He said He thought it better for the saints to Have A State  Government of their own than to be connected with New  Mexico or that Portion of Calafornia lying west of the Mountains  & then have to be Governed by some Petty officers sent from   those parts He said He had got A Post Office Esstablished at the  Salt Lake Valley And Elder Haywood Appointed Post Master  He had Also got A Post Office Esstablished At Garden Grove &   Mount Pisgah. He said He was vary familiar with the members  from Ioway & Illinois And that Thomas Benton of Mo came   to him just before he left & shook hands with him in A vary  familiar manner. He Also read me the printed correspondance  between him And Elder O Hyde comprising their difficulties   And After Hearing all of his subjects through Embracing  his whole course Expectation of office in the general surveyor-  ship of that country, & in the Territorial & State Government   &c &c I come to the following conclusion in my meditations  that He was at work upon his own hook that he was not   counciled by the Presidency of the Church to Engage in this  Government matter, And considering the course the Govern-  ment had taken towards us As A People I felt no disposition  as An individual to Petition them for Any thing, But let them   take whatever course they felt disposed And trust ourselves  And Affairs in the Hands of the God of Israel. yet whatever  course the combined council & wisdom of the Church thought proper  to persue in that channel I would throw my labour And influence  But As their is danger of mens trying to perform more then   they are sendt to do, And whareas I was sent to Preside over the   Eastern churches Preach the gospel to them & gather out as many   of them As I could to Zion, Therefore Resolved that my Present  state of Health, Duty, calling, inclination And the spirit within me  will not permit me to leave the business I was sent to do And go to  Washington to form An acpuaintance & gain influence with wicked  & corrupt men to lay A plan to assist in governing the Saints in the  Valley for with the grace of God I believe they are Able to govern themselves  Yet when called upon to go to Washington By the Presidency Im on hand

P. Pratt in August of 1848 "We are blessed in  gardens, in wheat, in corn And in all things I have set my hands   unto. I have raised some sixty bushels of good wheat without   Irrigations A few bushels of rye & oats, And my corn in the field looks  as well as any corn I ever saw in the states, the wheat crop exceeds  all expectation. Oats do better than in the States, say 60 bushels to  one of sowing on sod ground every kind of vegetable suited to the  northern latitudes does well. Levi Hancock sowed Eleven pounds wait  of calafornia wheat on the 14th April And reaped twenty two bushels  the latter part of July. He sowed half a bushel of common English  wheat on An Acre And A half And reaped upwards of twenty bush-  els's one grain of seven eared wheat produced seventy two ears. Barley  that was sown ripened And was reaped And carried off, the land then  was irrigated And produced from the roots A fresh crop four times  the quantity of the first crop. Oats that were sown produced a     
 good crop And cleared the roots again sprung up And produced  Another beautiful crop. three crops of Peas ripened on the same   spot of ground And the peas of the crop raised used for seed. Beet  seed planted this spring produced beets As thick as A mans leg And  go to seed And yield A large quantity. Cabbage seed planted this spring  produces seed Again." And many other good things were said. Wel  may the Saints Praise the Lord And shout Hosannah for He has  led his People through the wilderness deliverd them from his  Enemies And given them A gododly land that brings forth in  its strength.

I closed by making An address concern[ing]   Zion in the following words      [rest of page blank] 
 I cannot close my record upon the signs of the times witof 1848  without turning my eye towards Zion, yes Zion, which is not   now merely a phantom of the brain or a name, but actually a   living thing. Truly she is yet but a babe just born. Yet she has  A Tabernacle, the Mountains of Israel. Her bed is in the cham-  bers of the rocks. Her garden one of the rich valleys of Ephraim   She speaks and Her voice is as the voice of God. She has A spirit   which burns like flames of fire. She has power, And has started   A little stone rolling from the mountain her habitation, which   increases as it goes: it is causing the Earth to quake & tremble,   take care ye Nations it will grind you to dust. She has messengers  who go & come at her bidding, one of them can chase A thousand   and two put ten thousand to flight, they command the Element  & they obey them. She has An Ensign for the Nations to flee  to. She has A law which will soon govern the Earth. She is   born in the generation that David had A view of. O Praise   the LORD I am a witness that mine eyes have beheld her.   She has Keys to open & no man can shut, And shut And no man   can open. Her power is from Heaven whare she hath Noble   senators who plead her cause both day & night. This is the  Zion I seek After, this is the Zion I speak off. Her Church  is the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Her city   was sought in 1847 And the Lord has favored her from that   that time. And During the year 1848 the Church has been  organized with A first Presidency of three persons viz Brigham   Young, Heber C. Kimball & Willard Richards, who have gatherd   to the mountains of Israel, in the valley of the Great Salt   lake, Great Basin North America, And taken with them   some three thousand souls with their flocks & Herds, which   makes A population of about seven thousand souls in the   city of the Great Salt Lake. The Lord has also blest their   land which has brought forth in abundance. And while the Lord   has been multiplying blessing upon Zion in her quiete Habitation  Her messengers have been crying aloud to the Nations of   the Earth & the Isles of the sea preaching the gospel unto them  And uttering their testimony in the power of God And the   gift of the Holy Ghost untill they have gatherd their thousands   together untill one of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb (Orson   Pratt) Estimates that it will take three hundred ships to remove  the saints from the British Isles Alone to Zion. The Saints who   were gather into the valley of the Sacramento have discoverd   such vast mines of gold silver copper & other precious ores that  the report of it is creating great excitement throughout the world   Esspecially in the United States untill tens of thousands are rushing to  the gold regions to try to obtain the precious mettal. And as the hand  of God has been so visible in all the signs of 1848 May He continue his work   through 1849 and all following years untill His arm shall be made bare   in the eyes of all Nations. Untill Zion shall arive to her full strength of Manhood   for Brass may she have gold for Iron silver for wood Brass for stones Iron.   May her execters & peace officers be righteous men. May her Nobles be of Ephraim  And her Govournor procede out of the midst of Him. May all of her Messengers be armed  with righteousness in the power of God in great glory. May all of the Nations of the Earth  fear & tremble because of her law. May the wicked find her sons terrible when they go to  battle against her & not have power to stand before them. May her dwelling places   be distinguished by a pillar of fire by night & cloud by day, & in fine may she arise   & shine forth And spread herself abroad with all that perfection of beauty power   & glory which has ever been spoken concerning her Even to the full Expectation of God Angels & man   Wilford Woodruff

So while all Nature  is locked fast in sleep before the dawn of day is broke to start man from  his slumber I seat myself to say A few words to you. I said this was my  birth day, yes I am 42 years old this day. How such figures look to  a man while counting up his years in this probation. The vary sight  of them croud into the mind A flood of thought even more than  tongue can utter or pen can write. The last sixteen years of  my life has been spent in endeavouring to preach the Gospel & build   up the Kingdom of God in connexion with my brethren. The past  is gone, I have no desire to recal it, I would would not wish to live  my life over if I could. I feel like looking forward & not backward  I have a great desire that I may spend my future days doing the works  of righteousness, Honoring the Priesthood & my calling, saving the  souls of men, & building up the Kingdom of God that I may have a   place with the faithful at the end of the race. Turn my eyes which  way I will Either towards Babylon or Zion And I find the mov-  ements & signs of Either of them at the present day Are fully keep-  ing pace with the wheels of time. It is deeply interesting to see  hear, feel, & live in this age and gaze upon the scenery of the   whole Earth rushing like A Mighty cataract to finish its work  while the high minded Jew in the highth of his pride was exha-  usting his talents & oratory to prove to the Roman and the world   their right to independance greatness & power. The Son of God  was in Lamb like meekness bowing to the ordinance of Baptism  And all the rites of the gospel & commandments of his Father  looking forward to the day when He should make his second visit  to his brethren with his reward upon his head. So at the present  day while the Emperors, Kings, Princes, Lords, Nobles, Presidents  Governours, Statesman with all the great men of Babylon  have been making A desperate Effort to maintain their  dignity And appear to a good Advantage before the whole Earth     
 many of the most Noble spirits that ever dwelt in flesh   like Jesus and the Apostles have been meekly submitting to   the ordimances of the gospel, and like little children have   been subject to the Authority of the Holy Priesthood And have   made evry sacrafize required and laboured day & night to  build up Zion that the honest in Heart & the meek of the Earth  may have A place to flee to in order to Escape the just judgment  of ^that^ God whose rod is now suspendend in the Heavens and is about   to Fall upon the Earth and lay great Babylon with all of Her   greatness, pomp, power, and glory in the dust. My Prayer to God   is that evry Elder of Israel & saint of God throughout the whole   Earth may be incouraged to labour dilligently & faithfully   while the day of Harvests lasts for soon night will come when   No man can work, theyn ^they^ will be Just as sure of their reward  As was their chief captain & Head.      March 3, 1849 ~ Saturday      3rd [FIGURES] I wrote A letter to Mr Wm B. Goodyear Anapolis Md. I   Also recieved A letter from Wesley Siddle. Br Whipple called upon   me And spent the Afternoon I had A good time with him we conversed  upon A variety of subjects Among other things He informed me that   the Utah Lake abounded with the largest kind of the Mountain  trout some As much as two & three feet in length And that all  the small & large streams puting out of the Mountains Also   Abounded with trout. I went with Br Whipple into Boston  on my return I Assisted in the Baptizing of two individuals  in the sea in the midst of the Ice. Br Bird Administered the ordi-  nance in 3 feet of water they were the first He Baptized yet it  [FIGURE] was well done.      March 4, 1849 ~ Sunday      [FIGURE] 4th Sunday The United States is without A President to day   President Polk went out last night President  Taylor is installed to morrow. Hence there is no president to day  I met A congregation of saints And many strangers at Brother   Birds for A meeting At 2 oclok Elder Whipple from the Valley of   the Salt Lake was present. Elder J P Haven from the Bluffs  Also And A vary full House. I Addressed over one hour & had  much of the Spirit of God resting upon me And bore A strong   testimony unto the People preached the first principles of the  gosple And spoke of the general Bareings of the work of God   in the present Dispensation. In speaking of the body of Christ  And members in particular I told them I had seen men in   my travels without Arms, legs, some without eyes, &c but I had   never seen A man going about without A head. And As A natu-  ral body without A head would dye so the Church without ^a^ Head   would die.      Br Whipple followed me & made some vary good   remarks And edeyfying He said notwithstanding the Jews had Apostitized  the right of the kingdom belonged to them & Jesus came & set up the kingdom   among them they rejected it He took the kingdom from the Jews gave it   to the Gentile all that were in the kingdom went to the gentiles with the   Kingdom of God. The Gentiles in like manner have Apostitized And have  not continued in the goodness of God still they have A rightt to have the   kingdom of God set up among them in the last days And Joseph Smith   being warned & commanded of God has recieved the gospel from the hand   of an Angel, preached it to the gentiles set up the kingdom for the last time  among them they have rejected it, it will now again be taken from them   & given to the Jews & all in the kingdom will go to the Jews with it & many will   come from E. W. N. S. & sidt down with A[b]ram &c while the ^gentiles^ children of the Kingdom will be cast out     
 Brother Haven followed with interesting remarks in explaining   the principles of repentance, by A figure. If A Mother set two little   children at work, they should leave it & go to play & dirty their  clothes And when the Mother came [she] find they had not done the  work but been disobediant but promised forgiveness if they wo[uld]   go wash their face change their closes [clothes] & do the work one goes &   do as she is required the other follows her Mother & crys all day &   pleads with her to forgive her. When night comes one has cryed  all day for fiorgiveness, but has not done the thing required the other   has done the things required, which is most justifyed the   one that obeyed the Mother. So with Man it is not evry one [who]  says Lord, Lord, that shall enter into my Kingdom but He that   doeth the will of my father who is in Heaven.      I Administered the sacrament And confirmed two persons   And Blessed three children, And dismissed the meeting we had   A good time      March 5, 1849 ~ Monday      5th President Taylor takes his seat to day I sent 13 school Boo[ks]   [FIGURE] By Br Haven to President Young & council for their exhami[n]  ation.

When Joseph Smith sen The first   Patriarch in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints laid   his hands upon my head to give me my Patriarchal blessings he   said I should have my Father & Houshold standing with me in the   covenant of the Gospel and that I should have power to bring them   into the kingdom I afterwards visited my Fathers Household preached the   Gospel to them and baptized my father, step Mother, sister & every   member of his household & several other relatives.

 was 76 Seventy six years, and 3 three days old this day that I baptized   him, I have now baptized my Father Woodruff & Father in law Carter  this is a great consolation to my soul, Father Ezra Carter sen was the   son of Ezra Carter 84 years old, who was the son of Daniel Carter  who was the son of Ezekiel Carter, His Mothers Name was Phebe   Whitemore the Daughter of Elias Whitemore.

In heaven the Lord  had power over Lucipher son of the Morning & on Earth the Lord has   power over the devil & so has his servants when they have the spirit   of God in them and if a man does his Duty his house will be a   house of salvation. All men the righteous & wicked that come  beneath his roof will feel the influence of the spirit that reigns  in that house.

He said General I see a light in the  Parliament House, the General says I think it must be the  Moon, K[ing:] No sir the Moon does not shine there. He then  called six other Generals & two soldiers and order-  ed them to accompany him to the Parliament House  & they accompanied the king when they arived at the   House they saw it lighted with a large pair of Chandel-  iers holding lighted Candles and as their had never   been any such thing in the house they were afrighted  the king ordered one of the Generals to take the key   upon the door & go in & each one of the Generals in  there turn fell upon there knees & said they would   rather die than go into the house the King then said I  am your king I will lead the way you must follow  so the king opened the door & the Generals & soldiers   followed him, they Passed through a long Hall whi-  ch was hung in black in morning they went into   the Main Hall of the Parliament house, which was  brilliantly lighted they there saw three tables two  was occupied by two young men one sitting at each  as recorders with Books upon the top of the other   sat a vary ancient old looking man, upon one side   of the Hall or room stood an exicutioner with an ax in his  hand and a Block before him and 500 Nobleman   were crouded together like sheep in a pen, and when   the old man gave the word the executioner took one at  a time & cut their heads off upon the block untill he had     
 beheaded evry man and the blood coverd the floor  more than ancle deep & run into the street, the king   understanding that it was an open vision & not a reality   asked the old man several times when the fulfillment  of it would be the old man answered not the king then  fell upon his knees and prayed the Lord to tell him   the fulfillment of the vision the old man then   spoke & said that it would not be in his day or the  days of his children but it would be in the days   of the sixth or seventh king from him, then the   light went out the vision passed & all was darkn[ess]  the king & Generals all went into the street shut the   Parliament house door returned to there homes & wrot[e]  the testimony to the world in their own language which  remains in the libraries of Sweeden to this day, the   sixth King is now reigning and it is expected the   scene will soon take place as the king is now with the poor   and the Nobleman with against both king & People.      The second incident was a certain Hymn was herd sung   in three different Meeting Houses, in different parts of   sweeden, at the same hour of the night, by three  seperate parties, and the account was published in th[r]ee  seperate News papers at the same day in different parts   of the kingdom, this was in the year AD 1837      [rest of page blank]

Recommendations are about to be made officially from   this point to the general Government to furnish relief as  soon as possible to be forwarded on to the plains for the vast  multitudes who otherwise must inevitably leave their bones to  bleach by the way.

And now while I write  a Company is passing my door in the street dressed in all the Horid  form that the ingenuity of man could form up one would suppose   that the inhabitants of the bottomless pit had come forth in   possession I wrote a letter to Mrs Woodruff 50 m      July 5, 1849 ~ Thursday      5th I baptized Mr Priom Pease which made some stir among the   people I dined with Brother Peas spent the afternoon with   Knowlton & night with John Luce      July 6, 1849 ~ Friday      6th It is a hard rainy day I seem to be weather bound in   Thomaston am waiting for Passage to New Brunswick      I found 8 members of the Church in South St George 7 in Thomaston   [FIGURE] I wrote two letters one to Little & Hardy one to J.

Here I was 42 miles from St Johns on foot & no   conveyance with A Heavy travelling bag with A vast burning  forest to go through I did not stop to meditate or complain  of my situation but swung my carpet bag over my shoulder   again & started on my journey on foot, in good spirits most   of the road was through dens forest rocky & poor soil many parts   of the forest was inhabited by bears & wolves. After travelling  a few miles I overtook an Irishman on foot we walked   together several miles A man came in a waggon & took   my bag & carried it 5 miles for me to Mr McGowins which   was great relief to me. On my Arivalsat McGowens I   found my bag safe & got a chance to send [it] on 15 miles further   to Mr Tiltons, & was glad to get rid of the load if I had to   walk myself I took dinner here the Irishman left I saw  no more of him. I had now walked about 20 miles   at 1 oclok besides waiting 3 Hours for the stage I had 15 m   more to walk before I could stop for the night. I found   the whole forest as I came along laid waste by the late fires   which swept fences, dwellings, barns, Mills, lumber yard  & evry thing els in its march & but few dwellings rema-  ining. Although I began to be vary weary & lame yet I  entered the dark forest before me And I found my last  15 miles A sore dreary road indeed And it seemed as though   I could not get through And when I did arive at Mr  Tiltons I was so lame I could scearcely walk at all & was  under the Necessity of going to bed without my supper I   washed myself in cold water from Head to foot to take   the soreness out of my cords & limbs & went to bed but   was to weary to sleep much I had walked this day 35 m   A thing I had not done before in 10 years      July 17, 1849 ~ Tuesday      17 I arose this morning vary lame from yesterdays walk   I have 15 miles to reach St Johns I walked one mile & found   A Merchant Mr Beaty who gave me a ride with him into the   city of St Johns which I considerd A great Blessings. I   found St John to be A plesant business place esspecially for  Mills & Lumber. The whole face of the Earth that I saw   from Fox Islands to St Johns was vary rocky barren & rough, timber  mostly spruice & ceder. A few days before I arived at St Johns the  Orange men of that City had a walk were attacked by the Catho-  licks A fight ensued 20 or so were killed & many wounded I   went onto the scene of Action saw the ball & shot Holes in the     
 doors & windows & buildings as we passed along this was in the  edge of the burnt district there has been some vary destructive   fires in that city. I spent 2 Hours here then went to Indiantown  went on board of the Forest Queen steemer bound for   Frederickton 90 miles up the St Johns River it was quite  A rainy windy Afternoon yet I walked the Herricane  deck to view the country for the scene had now change   from A vary rough country to A delightful plesant one for  the whole country for several miles each side of the river  from St Johns to Frederickton was in a high state of cultivation  & settelled, more resembled the farms of Illinois then the barren   Hilly, rocky country which I have before visited in the Colonies  I never saw 90 miles on the bank of any river more bea-  utifully cultivated or plesantly located than the St Johns  River. It is quite A stream for fish. I saw the salmon   & sturgeon jumping out of water as we went up the river  we arived at Frederickton at 8 oclok I put up at the tem-  perance Hotel in York street distance of the day 115 miles      July 18, 1849 ~ Wednesday      18th I learned this morning I could not go to Miramichi untill  the 20th I walked into the city to try to get some New York   papers to read. I called upon the Hon Mr Partlow M. P.  who loaned me the New York Journal of Commerce which  I read with much interest I then walked through the city  & found it to be a delightful situation upon the bank of the  river location level with all of the streets runing west  terminating 2 or 3 miles west of the city upon a High Mounta  in with a gradual ascent. I saw a company of 24 soldiers  excercise by fireing musket balls at a target some 500 balls were  fired at some 20 or 25 rods about 1/4 of them Hit A board twice  the size of a man, some Half dozen hit the bulls eye 8 inch in  diameter the balls fell into the St Johns river some half a mile   distant. I visited the graveyard, And A large cathedral build-  ing. I learned from the papers, that there had been 1300  deaths in one week in Cincinnati & about the same No in   St Louis.

 through A Hilly rough country to travel day & night I did not  see what way one pair of Horses was going to travel with any speed  with such a train of Lumber behind them but I soon  found out for as soon as we come to the top of A Hill the Horses  could not Hold the waggons And of course they went down  the Hill upon A keen run as fast as there legs could carry them  & continued to run untill they got part of the way up the   next Hill in this way we got along vary fast we changed   Horses evry 20 miles we travelled in this way the whole rout      July 21, 1849 ~ Saturday      21st I find myself this morning sitting in the open stage   with the Horses runing down all the Hills at full speed with   the driver snoreing & fast asleep And continued untill   sun was two hours high we came within a foot of running  the waggon off a precepice 30 feet deep which would   have dashed us to peases among the rocks the driver awoke  & when He saw the danger He had run he turned pale but  was soon asleep again we continued Journeying in this way  for 100 miles & arived at the ferry of the Beaubaurs Island  whare we arived at 10 oclock whare I left the stage feeling  vary thankful that my bones were whole & my life preserved  I crossed the ferry to the Island walked one mile through  A plesant grove to the House of Elder Joseph Russels I found  Him at home & we had A Happy Greeting indeed.

The Rector preached A Preperation   sermon, before the bishop confirms, the church by the laying on   of hands. He dwelt mostly upon this subject to prove the laying on  of hands to be an ordinance from the Apostolic Church He ran   down the Presbyterian church & all other sects, they had No  authority to Preach. It was ownly pretention for them to   under take it. But the Esstablished church had got Authority  to preach from the Ancient Apostles through the Church of  Rome, which He also discarded All there ceremonies were  vary wearysome we spent the night at the Inn      July 30, 1849 ~ Monday      30th We went on board of the packet A small schooner who  carried the Maliel. the Capt & Hands were all gone when it   was time for them to [cast] off.

 season instead of fall or winter for those cut in the summer   or winter season will not keep over three years bfor in that time   all the gum will work out & dry rot will follow & they become  as light as A cork And any ship or steem boat will be runied   whare they are used, while those cut from Sept to March   will last 50 or more years retain the gum & be sound this   is important information which I recieved from Joseph   Russell who in 20 years has built over 40 ships over 600   tone burthan.

Pratt is expecting to go to South America.  The revolutions of the Nations of the Earth during the past  season have been interesting. The following is a synopsis  of the movements during the summer of '49. The Romans arose  in mass drove the Pope from his Throne & kingdom & he dHad to  seek protection in foreign countries. The President of France  Louis Napolian sent An army to Rome to subdue the people &  reinstate the Pope And after much hard fighting, they Entered  Rome, & took command of the City. The Hungarians arose &  Proclaimed there Independance raised large Armies & would   have subdued Austria Had not Russia sent out her Mighty   Armies Against her And After many thousands of the Allied  Armies of Austria & Russia were slain by the Brave Hungarians they  the Hungarians were overpowerd, or Gen Georgey surrendered his  Armies & Louis Kossuth the President And main spring of Hungary  left the Nation & went to Turkey. Jermany has Also been in     
 an unsettelled state And within a few days past the French  Minister at Washington has been dismissed & his Pasports   offered him & He is invited to return home. Also High   words have passed between the American & British Minister  And what the result of these things will be time must   determine but one thing is certain wars & dreadful  Judgments Await the Nations of the Earth.

Our prospects for grain are tolerable good, & if we are not  flooded with immigration intending for the Mines but compelled  to tarry here we should have plenty for the ensuing year.      Our Wheat harvest is now at its highth and is coming off far better  than appearances seemed to warrant. The spirit of industry which  has ever characterized the saints of the Most High God has been brought  to bear with wonderful effect upon the burning & Arid desert.  The Next time that you encounter The hardships privation & toil  of A Journey over the plains & mountains you will meet with a   vary different reception from what attended your first arival  Here Friends will greet your Arival and the products of the Earth  will administer to your comfort.      Our city and valley is fast  improveing. Roads are being made & Bridges, Mills, & Houses building on  evry side with Asstonishing rapidity considering our circumstances   and the disadvantages under which we labor but the blessings of health  peace & union have attended us hence our prosperity we have A settle-  ment in the Utah valley & have Extended North above the Weber   river. We have to irrigate our land which is considerable labor   but will diminish as we improve in fixtures & experience. One  thing is certain all the necessary products of the Earth for the  sustinance of man can be raised. You have probably learned  before this that we are endeavoring to obtain A legal government   from the U. S. Dr Bernhisel is East upon this business And Brother  A W Babbitt will leave tomorrow as our delegate to Washington  our object is to gain admission as a sovreign state into the  Union whenever you can use your influence to further   this object do so. Also gather up the saints & come on with   all you can bring another season we shall be quite Happy  to see you as will all your friends.      We had yesterday a  celebration of the Anniversary of the Arival of the Pioneers   in this valley it was A Day long to be remembered.

 The following speech was deliverd by Mr Copway or Kah-ge-ga-gah-Bow   the Chief of the Ojewa Nation before a large audience in New York City   On the eve of Dec 15 1849      Ladies, Gentlemen, American Citizens. Of necessity my address this   evening must be short. Yet I will touch upon a few prominent items   which I consider important to the subject in which I feel deeply interested   There are certain events which stand forth in bold relief of deep   interest in the history of evry nation under heaven. Therefore the  History of the Indians or there present condition has also a deep interest   an interest of greater importance than at first presents itself to the mind  of the American People Although it may appear to them as coverd with   A cloud or buried deep from their view yet it none the less exhists.      Then listen to me. I have deeply studied the situation & interest of my   brethren the Red men for years and I have resolved to call aloud upon the   white men of this Nation to give ear to my Petitons. If you do not see  the Indian Orator in your midst making a displey of oratory like the   white man it is not because he has not talent but because he has not  a chance to exercise it      1th My object in visiting the United States is to present A petition to   this Government that they may assist me in concentrating the Indians   together that they may live & not die I want Congress to grant them   a portion of Territory that they can call their own and be concentrated  upon it that they not be driven from it any more. They once were   the owners & occupiers of the whole soil of all North America. The white  man came & removed the Indians and continually driven them   untill they can see no hope but the grave before them. I now ask in their  behalf a Territory to settle them upon that they may have a permanent   home forever And come under the United States Government   let them have some form of Government & become part and   parcel of the United States. In this matter I have studied the  interest of all both the white & red men      1st Give them a Territory that they can call their own where   the children can point to the graves of their fathers & say we can   now live in Peace and be driven no more. We can visit the graves of   our fathers with none to drive us from them and they will be inspired   to engage in evry laudable undertaking that now marks the course of  the white man      2nd You can then esstablish schools among them   that will be of benefit to them, they would obtain knowledge and   would make a good use of it. The gospel could then be introduced   among them and they would be far more ready to recieve it  when they find the white man is consistant & willing to do them   good, but when the white man offers the gospel to the Indian  one year & the next comes d& drives him from his home & the grave  of his Fathers He has no faith or confidence in either the white  man or his gospel      3rd You can then introduce agriculture   among them and they will recieve it for they would then see of  necessity they must cultivate the land or die they could not depend upo[n]   game for support and they would turn their attention to cultivating   the soil make improvements and take delight in the same dway as the white  man      4th They would then be in a position whare they would be   deliverd from the Ill consequences of constant removing which has continu[ally]     
 followed them for many years. And The Ill consequences of removing   have been multiplied & vary great. This has been one main reason   why schools have been unproductive of good among them. This is   also whone reason why Missionaries have done no more good among them  The Indians are fast decreasing and Passing away what is the  cause of all this. There are various causes Their constant remov-  ing is one cause. Disease which has been introduced among them   By white men in the capacity of traders, missionaries, and Emigrants   Also the introduction of Alchoohol have had a tendency to waste them  away. Also wars among themselves & wars with white men all of   which have continually wasted away the Indan tribes      I will here remark that in the origin of the wars with the whites   the conducting of those wars and in the treaties of peace made And   broaken the Indians have been badly treated and abused by the  whites. For instance some ruffian or trader visites the Indians  introduces wild fire or Alcohol among them & will get the Indians  drunk & pehaps drunk himself and will cheat them in any way   he can And perhaps kill some of them and in his career he gets   killed himself, then the cry goes forth that the savage Indians  are killings & murdering the inhabitants of the country. it is proclaim-  ed in all the public Journals of the Union. Yes one side of the   story is proclaimed as with peals of thunder throughout the Earth   But no voice is raised in behalf of the poor Indian. their story   is not told the world hear it not they do not enquire or ask for  it. But as soon as the story of the white man is told & proclaimed  to the world, the armies of war must be prepared & soldiers  sent forth to drive and Kill the Indians and burn their home   and in this way the most desolating and expensive wars have been   carried on for many years untill we feel it is time for the white  man to take a different course with the Indians.      As an example of the bad Effects of continually removing the  Indians I would refer you to the Cherokee Nation. That people  were fast imprioving following rapidly in the footsteps of the white   man had extensive farms & good dwellings and continuallyed   rapidly advancing in improvements untill they were suddenly   brought to a stand in theire course by being cruelly called upon   by the state of Georgia to give up their lands and go away from the  graves of their fathers into the wilderness and thus it was that   the mighty nation instead of recieving that support encouragement  & comfort from the Nation that He ought to recieve was forced By   the cruel hand of oppression to bow their heads in sorrow and  dispair as they wend their way to their so called home in the   wilderness whare they can find no other hope ownly to pass a few   more years in sorrow untill they shall be called to pass through the   same ordeal again to remove and remove untill they are anhilated   from off the face of the Earth. O Ye white man what incour-  agement do you give the Indian to plant, to build, to learn, to   cultivate the Earth, or to recieve a Religion that professes love   mercy kindness and truth while those who profess to Enjoy it   deals out such deeds of oppression & cruelty upon the heads of the  red men that it drives them to madness and Despair. Let the   American Nation stay their hand from this time forth in their oppression  & drivings of the Indians lest they drive them beyound a point which   the Indian will endure and return a Blow upon the head of the   white man which will fill many a habitation with death. Once give  the Indians A Territory A home whare they can have a full assurance     
 that therier ears or those of their children will no more be   saluted with a call to remove from their lands then if they  do not show forth a spirit of improvement then cast them   off as not worthy of your support or attention but untill then  you are not justifyed yur garments are not clear      The spirit of the age & times demands that Congress should take  immediate action upon theis matter.      1st The Indians cannot retain   their lands. Emigration of the white men are already surround-  ing them & in their midst and the richness & fertility of the   Indians lands are a temptation to the white man and invite   him to settle thereon.      2nd The Indians have two much land   more than what they need to till and cultivate for their support   Let there be a Territory set off on the North west of Ioway North   of Council Bluffs on the Missouri on which there is now no  white settlement And let the Indians East of the Rocky moun-  tains And in the United States be gatherd upon it. Then let other  Territories in the west be appropriated And let all the Indians on  the North American Continant be collected together & learned  to cultivate the Earth. They will soon associate themselves   together, and cease their wors among themselves also with  the white man. If there is not sumthing of this kind done  the vast Emigration through all the Indians lands will soon   destroy the game & then want & starvation will ensue & this   will bring on war between the white & Red men.      If my Proposition is excepted by the American government   And they will carry it out it will be of vast benefit both to   the Indians And the people of the United States      1st The Benefit to the Indians will be it will give them a perman[ent]   home, whare schools can be esstablished among them and   their children taught the English language. Farms can also be   opened among them and when they see they have a permanent   home for themselves and their children and they have no game   to depend upon for food they will immediately go to work & cultivate   the Earth like white men. The gospel can then be introduced  among them to a good Effect and they will recieve it with   Thankfulness when they can be made to believe that then  the hand that deals out the gospel to them is not laying a plan   to take the advantage of them and preparing a way to drive them  from their home & country. It will also unite not ownly their   interest & attachment towards each other but their regard & interest   with that of the United States      The benefit to the Government is less expenses      1st Buying theire lands and Paying them yearly annuities whis   is costing the Government immens sums of money       2nd The contiunual transporting of Indians from place to place   there has already been 96000 indians removed by the govern-  ment      3rd The keeping of many Indian Agents at great  expens to Government could then be dispensed with       4th Fortifications have now to be erected ion the borders of all India[n]   tribes with the Intention of keeping the Indians in subjection   these would not be needed of [if] the Indians were in a Territory  of their own for by having their trail clear & no encroachments of  the white man upon their borders there would be no cause of war  or fortifications.     
 I am going to Washington so on to lay my Petition  before the Congress of the United States and urged them   to grant my Prayer for the benefit of both the white  and Red men. I want your aid, I want you to sign my  petition that the voice of thousands may be bheard in  behalf of this petiontion. I want the names of Legeslators  Governors and American citizens in General that my prayer   may be heard & answerd. Give the North American Indians  A home, a place whare the soles of their feet can rest in peace  then you will do your duty towards them, & place them in a  situations whare you can teach them Literature, Agriculture,  & Commerce, give them the chance the white man has, And I  Prophesy in the name of the Lord that there will ere long be  found among them their Philosophers, Franklins, & Washing-  tons, who would do honor to any civillized or Christian  Nation on the globe. But let this Nation turn a deaf ear to  my Petitions and the Petitions of the Indians, continue   to oppress them and drive them to desperation, and the   hour is near when the campfire will be seen upon many a   hill. The war hoop will reache from one end of the Rocky  Mountains to the other. The Indian will then sell his life   as dear as possible and deal out death whareever an opportunit[y]  offers. When this blow is struk It will be Terrible to all  May God forbid that shch such a blow should fall at all, that the  scenes of Bloody Brook should any more be enacted.      American Citizens it is to ward of this blow that I now stand  before you, That I now call upon this Nation bearing a petition  unto them, will you hear my Prayer, will you give the   Indian his rights, will you help bury the hate hat forever  Or will you make a grave to bury your dead I leave you to DECIDE       The following is A true copy of the Petition      To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives  The memorial of the undersigned citizens and Residence of the United   States Most Respectfully showeth  That the present state of the Indian Tribes within the jurisdiction  of the United States and the continant of North America is  a subject worthy of the consideration of evry Christian and  philanthropist in this union. That if by any practical method  these Aboriginal and Primitive owners of the soil can be civillized   and incorporated into the body politic as enlightened and useful  citizens no time should be lost in making the attempt.      The rapid advancing spirit of the age presents this subject before   Congress as indispensible to be acted upon now. With this subject in  view and with earnest prayer to Almighty God to Enlighten your councils  on this momentous subject we the under signed present the cause   of the Indians to the Earnest consideration of your Honorable Body  praying that such means may be spedily adopted that will give to the  Red Man a permanent home and all the Arts conveniences and com-  forts of civillized life. To this End we pray that A sufficent portion of the  great North Western Territory may be appropriated to this use for the  reception & consentration of such of the Indian Tribes as may Be willing to become agricult-  urist and recieve from the hands of the white man a sound ysystem of moral & intellectual   training. The land so appropriated to be erected into an Indian District subject to such form of   goverment & such laws as Congress may deem consistant with the constitution & laws of the United States     
 Mr Copway remarked to W. Woodruff in personal conversation  That He had long contemplated the situation of the poor Indians and  he well know their position and feelings and if the United States  did not soon take a different course and scease their persecutions  and oppressions and driving the Indians to such extremities as they  were doing that the Indians would soon rise up in their wrath   Unite together and seek revenge and strike a Blow unto death And  it was in consequence of a knowledge of this fact that had inspired  him to go through the United States call meetings and lecture   before the people and strive to call the attention of the white men   to use his influence to assist in staying this spirit of oppression against   the Indian. But I meet with but little success the Christians of  this day manifest but little sympathy with me. I was a while with  the Methodist and If I would confine myself with there doctrines they  would help me but the moment that I wanted my liberty to bee free  and act independantly they would forsake me but I am tired of such  bigotry I am resolved to do all in my power to call upon the people and   Government that my garments may be clear in trying to ward off the  blow which I know will come if the people of the United States  do not scease their oppressions And when it does come I had rather  not be alive than to see what will follow. But if they will not harken  to my petition nor to the cry of the Indians I am as ready to die at   the cannons mouth as any whare els I will go before Congress and   talk plain before them And tell them that I want them to do sumthing  with me for the Indians that we have bourn affliction & oppression  from the hand of the people of the United States all the day long   and it is time it was stoped. The world have accused us of being  connected with the Mormons to overthrow the Government I shall  tell them it is false there has been no such combination at all  but I shall tell them the Indians have treated the India white  men well. And so have the Mormons thereated the Indians   well And the People of the United States And even have fed   their enemies And helped them while in distress in the willder  ness. The Mormons have never given the wIandians any council  to go to war with the whites or with themselves but always have coun  cilled them to make peace. This principle I shall declare upon the  floor of the Halls of Congress. But says this Lamanite Chief   If this Nation does not hear us, does not help us does not cease therir  oppression still we have hope, for the Great SPIRIT will at   last both Hear Help and Deliver us For as A people we shall not  die, for If the Lord has to raise us up help out of the Rocky Mountains   that Help will arise which will both save us and do us GOOD      [rest of page blank] 
 Views of Col. Thomas L. Kane on a Government for Deseret      Nov 26th 1849 In company with Dr J. M. Bernhisel I called upon  Col Kane to have an interview with him In Relation to Petitioning Congress  for the reception of the State of Deseret into the Union      The following is a synopsis of the conversation of Col Kane      You must not commit yourselves to any party but keep a close   mouth with all parties and the utmost discreet and wise course must   be pursued in order to do any thing at all. I will do what I can   with the free soil party. My Father and Mr Dallest with the Democ-  rats. It will be the most critical Congress ever held. "I Applyed  according to the wish of President Young for a Territorial Gove-  rnment I had my last sad and Painful interview with Presi-  dent Polk I found He did not feel disposed to favor your   People and had his men of his own stamp picked out to serve  as Govornor & other officers who would have oppressed You   or injured you in any way to fill their own Pockets He would not  appoint men from among yourselves. And I saw it absolutely  necessary that you should have officers of your own people to govern  you or you were better without any Government. I had to use my  own discretion and I withdrew the Petition I am fully decided  upon that point that you must have officers of yourselves, &   not military Politiscians who are struting around in your midst  usurping Authority over you. It will not do for you to take the   slavery question or Antislavery or any other side but the nutral.  Atchinson of Missouri with the Mormon opposing party will still be  your enemies Thomas Benton has been an inveterate enemy and  still may be. And all the Parties with the whole of Congress is a mass  of corruption & abomination they are all governed by party manage-  ment without any regard to principle & if we do any thing upon   this subject we shall have to Enter into wise Management we  may have to favor the south some though they are your Enemies  and I hate to do it. Parties are all breaking up And New Ones  forming and no man can tel what a day will bring forth.  Thomas Benton was at the Head of your being driven from   Winter Quarters the Indian Country and Polk favored it and  I could not turn them from their purpose I told Mr Polk we  should not present any Petition while He dictated matters.  Benton is still your Enemy at heart.      Douglass is going down   with a certain class connected with him. The time was when   He could have done your People much good by merely bearing  his Testimony of your good character while he was as Judge in  Illinoise and He would not do it (Let this be remembered)      Col Kane remarked that from the acquaintance I have had with Mr   Bxxxxx I Apprehend entertain serious Apprehentions that He will by his  course at Washington injure your cause, He was formerly A small   politition but a rough one of the Missouri Stamp and this in my view   to some extent would disqualify him for the business Besides He expressed  a want of confidence in his wisdom prudence and discretion to  manage this affair and that He would associate with an inferior  class of men in the lower House which would also exhert a prejudi-  cal effect upon our cause     
 The following remarks were made By Col Kane to W Woodruff Dec 4th 1849      Col Kane remarked You are better without any Government from   the hands of Congress than a Territorial Goverment. The Political  intreagues of Government Officers will be against you. You can govern  yourselves better than they can govern you. I would prefer to  see you withdraw the Bill than to have a Territorial Government   for if you are defeated in the State Government you can fall  upon it again at another session if you are not a Territorial  Government but if you are you cannot apply for a state Government  for a number of years. I insist upon it you do not want  corurupt Political men from Washington strutting around  you with military epilets & dress, who will spec[u]late out of you  all they can. They will also control the Indian Agency land   Agency and will conflict with your calculation in a great  measure. You do not want two Governments with you you have   a Government now which is firm & Powerful and You are  under no obligations to the United States You owe them  nothing but kicks cuffs and the treatment of wicked dogs  for that is the ownly treatment you have recieved from their  hands since you have been a People. ("And the golden rule is what  measure men meet out shall be measured to them again")      Brigham Young should be your Govornor. His head is not  filled with Law Books and Lawyieers tactics but he has power to  see through men & things And all councillors Elders & agents [abroad]  should be made to know their place, sustain the head man & work  for the general good in all things and not act from selfish motives  or to get some petty office or a little salary. He said if we you did make   up our minds to ask for a Territory we should use evry exhertion  in our power to get the assureance of the President that our   choice should be granted us in a Govornor & other officers say  Brigham Young for Govornor &c But if we could not get  this assurance not to ask for it at all but wait the result  He said If we were a state, there might be ever so many   men come along and say I am Judge, I am Col, I am Gen  You can whistle and ask no odds of them. But while a Territory  You cannot do it. And then their is always so many intrigues  to make Political parties among you, the first thing you know  A strong Political party is rising up in your midst who are selfish  And against your interest.      Col Kane requested me to remember  what He had said to me as He might not have hea[l]th to do for us  what he was now doing And He wished his views to be known  to the Presidency in the valley. I remarked to him that I would  do so and Pray for his success in our behalf also for his hea[l]th strength   & prosperity. He thanked me & said He should Prize our prayers  Highly.      I felt impressed that Col Kane was Endowed with much wisdom   in his course in our be half and I think that He had right views  of things in General      [rest of page blank] 
 Signs of the times and remarks upon the year AD. 1849      The narrative of the year 1849 forms A remarkable chapter in the History  of the world, perhaps no single year has embraced a greater number   of important events or involved so great & lasting consequences in such   a variety of relations. The overthrow of the Sikhs the esstablishment of   the British Power on the ruins of the sikh dynasty the deposition of the pope   the declaration of the Roman Republic and its early extin[c]tion by the French  intervention & the struggles in sardinia, the movements of the people in Jerm-  any; the contest between the Danes And Jermans; the intervention of Russia  in Hungaryian affairs; the fall of Hungary; the overthrow of Venice and  the movements in the national mind of France on social questions are all  pregnant with vast Results Also the passing of the Bill in the British Parliament   on the 23rd of Feb granting to Jews the right to seats in the Parliament of Great  Britiain is one strong omien of the redemption of that Peculiar people. These   in connexion with storms, whirlwinds, Earthquakes, fires and the most desola  ting pestilence & Plagues which has swept over Europe & Eastern world shows   clearly to the reflecting mind who has any portion of the Testimony of Jesus Christ  that the Great God has commenced his controversy with all Nations and that   Great Babylon is coming in Rememberance befor God. And when we turn our  attention to the western Hemisphere the United States of America, any   true seer might Justly say that notwithstanding thy Nation O Land  like the Antedeluvian world & Sodom & Gomorrow boast of their union strength  goodness greatness & glory. Yet is here that I behold the signs of the   times big with Events, it is here that I behold the clouds thicken the  Heavens gather Blackness, And the wrath of God ready to fall upon they head   For thou aret worthy. Notwithstanding O America thou art blowing aloud  thy trumpet of fame & honor to all the world in sympathizing with Cossuth  and other Brave Hungarians and offering a Home to the oppressed of   All nations, still thou art the man who dare commit the blackest   deeds of the Earth. It is here the God of Heaven has commenced to set   up his kingdom and offered thee the gospel of Jesus Christ to save  the from the wrath of God. It is here whare that kingdom & gospel has  been rejected first. It is here whare Presidents Govornors Judges  and rulers of the Land with thousands of the people have broaken the   laws & Constitution of the United States and the several states by turning   mob And persecuting many of their own citizens who were the saints   of God, have deprived them of the rights of citizenship, burned their   goods & dwellings, taken some of them prisiooners held mock trials over  them by a mob Jury who were their Jury by Day & guard by night who  would pour whiskey down each others throats And then God Dam   God, And Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost, And evry religious sect they could   think of & close their songs twith the words God Dam the God dDam Mormons   then would imprision the saints in chains and feed them on Human   flesh, And finally murdered many of the Saints with the Phrophets   whom God hath sent unto them to call them to Repentance And when those   persecuted American cities [citizens] pled at the feet of the Presidents Govornors   and Judges of the Nation, they have been rejected & ridiculed while at the   same time they have in some instances been informed that there cause was   Just. And even down to the present day evry Petition presented by the   Saints of God who have been driven into the wilderness by the cruel hand   hand of oppression is rejected in evry possible way Because of these  things the Lord hath said that He will arise out of his Hiding place  and in his fury He will vex the Nation And in his Hot displeasure     
 will cut off those wicked and unjust stewards and Appoint them   Portion with Hypocrites & unbelievers. One glance at the signs of   1849 in the United States will show that the Lord has commenced  to fulfill his promise And He will not scease untill it is finished   There has never been A year since the esstablishment of the United  States Government, when there has been so great a loss of property   & life by fire & Pestilence, or such an increase of mobs or confusion  and Perplexity in the Government as in 1849. Among the most desolat-  ing fires may be named the burning of Watertown on Sunday the 13th of   April $121,000 worth of property destroyed. five days after on the 18 of April   the tremendious conflagration at St Louis more than half the businesspart  of the city was burned $6000000 worth of property destroyed. The   Plague also in the form of the cholera visited the same city soon after   the fire and in few weeks laid in the grave 8000 of its inhabitants the   cholera ahas also swept many thousand into the grave in various parts of   the United States. it has raged through most parts of the land during the   past season. Mobs have also increased to an alarming degree in the United   States, in New York, Philadelphia, ^&^ Portland, they have been very consp-  icuous. The desolution of the American Union also seems to be fast   ripening during the past year. the slavery question seems to be the great   hinge upon which the Nation will split At the meeting of Congress  the House spent 18 days in organizing the House & Electing the speaker  which cost the Goverment near $100000, And it continues to be one   of the most exciting Congresses ever met in the United States And   if the war spirit now visible in the midst of Congress continues  to increase It is quite probable that the Union may be dissolved before  the close of this session. Although many Editors of the public Journals  have ridiculed for several years the Idea of the Dividing of the American   Union but this year thisey feel vary serious upon the subject And all the  signs of the times in this government indicate that the hand writing   upon the wall is begining to be visibly seen concerning the fate of   this Nation.      When we turn our eyes towards Zion during the year 1849 we can  behold the hand of the Lord also visible in her behalf. The Lord hath   promised great Blessings concerning Zion And the faithful Saints are watching   all signs appertaining to her with feelings of the deepest interest. for years past   Zion has been oppressed and as a captive removeing to and fromo but she has   finally found a resting place in the rich valleys of Ephraim in the great Bason   between the High Mountains & Everlasting Hills of North America And during   the year 1849 she has organized herself unto an Indipendant sovreign State  And appointed her Governor & Nobles of themselves, so that Her Nobles are  of themselves & her Govornor has proceded out of the midst of Ephraim  in Zion she has prospered more than during any year since her   organization she is rapidly building up a city in peace, has good crops, universal  Health, has made Arangements to lay of three New cities. Has re-organized her   marshal Legion of mighty men. 100 families have gone 200 miles South to   form A settlement under the Presidency of Bishop Morley in the sand   Pitch valley. The Church during this years haves laid the foundation for   a fund called the perpetual fund the object of which is to gather   unto Zion all the poor saints who cannot gather themselves from  Council Bluffs, the United States And from all the world, expect-  ing it to increase yearly untill all Israel is gatherd this fund is esstablished  by voluntary contributions of the Saints $5,500 was collected in the valley   in this way in one month And Bishop Edward Hunter was sent to     
 Council Bluffs with the money to buy oxen to take up the poor from   there to the valley the coming spring. The Elders of Israel are also   determined to send the gospel to all the world as soon as possible   All of the Apostles who were in the valley have had missions   assigned them. Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball, & Willard Richards   compose the first Presidency. Orson Hyde the President of the Twelve   the following are the full quorum of the present Twelve, Orson Hyde   Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A.  Smith, Amasa Lyman, Charles Ezra T. Benson, Charles C Rich  Lorenzo Snow, Erastus Snow, & Franklin D Richards. Orson   Hyde is publishing the Guardian & presiding at Council Bluffs   Parley P. Pratt is Appointed to preside over the Pacific Islands   Orson Pratt is doing a great work in England some ten or  twelve thousand have been baptized under his Presidency   During 1849. Wilford Woodruff has been presiding over the   Eastern States & Canidas & has travelled over 5000 miles among  the churches And is now called upon to gather the remnants  to Zion George A. Smith And Ezra T. Benson has led a camp of   the saints from the Bluffs to the valley through many dangers   Amasa Lyman & Charles C Rich Are at San Francisco  presiding over western Calafornia. John Taylor Lorenzo   Snow, Erastus Snow, & Franklin D. Richards, with about 20   Elders have arived in the States from the valley On mission   to England, France Italy Denmark & Sweden so evry thing   is prospering in the Church & kingdom of God And All the  signs of the Times bespeak the comping of the Lord Jesus Christ      What 1850 will bring to pass time must determin but it   is certain it will be full of the Events of the times. The History   of Each year is important now Plagues, war, fire & Pestilence &   famine will lay many low in death: who will live. I am expecting  to start in April to lead A company to the Bluffs & on to the valley   the dangers are many I shall have to go through, But I Pray   my Heavenly Father to protect & sustain me & those who shal   go with me that we may reach in safety. I Also pray to the Lord   to preserve & bless the Twelve And all the Elders of Israel who   go on foreign missions, And Bless the Presidency with the power   of God, & cause Zion to arise And put on her beautiful garments   I pray that the oppressions of Zion may scease that her inhabita-  nts may have power to build Houses & inhabit them plant  vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. I Pray that her landing may  be like the Garden of the Lord that she may have the early &  latter rain that the Land may bring forth ofin her stregngth.  O, Lord order our cause aright which is before the Congress of   this Nation may all things work together for the good of thisy   saints, preserve us all from Evil of evry kind and help us to do  thy will in all things on the Earth. O Lord Hasten the gathering of   Israel, who are cast out And the dispersed of Judagh may the  Lamanites soon blossom like the rose, May the Zion of God who has risen  and gone up into the mountains be clothed upon with wrighteousness  and the power of God. May the Church become prepared like a   bride prepared for the coming of the Bridegroom And myay they  People not ownly have cause to rejoice in the Holy One of Israel   during the AD 1850 But through all time And All Eternity

The following is a portion of the  contents or substance of it "They have universal health good crops plenty to  eat No sickness or Death of late are Prospering on evry hand are laying off three  new cities one at Brownville one at Utah Valley & one at Sandpitch valley  200 miles south of salt Lake valley from 50 to 100 families had gone to form   a settlement at Sand Pittoh valley under the Presidency of Father Morley  they had organized the Nauvoo Legion in the valley and it would  have been a source of Joy to the Saints throughout the Earth could they  have witnessed its movements on the day of its great parade to see a  whole Army of mighty men in martial aray ground their Arms not  by command but simply by request repair to the temple block and with pick & spade  open the foundation for a place of worship & treat the pilasters beams & roof so  that we now have a commodious edifice 100 by 60 feet with brick walls whare  we assemble with the Saints from sabbath to sabbath & almost evry evening in the   week to teach, council & defise [devise] ways and means for the prosperity of the  Kingdom of God, and we feel thankful that we have a better house   or bowery for Public worship the coming winter than we have heretofore  had any winter in this dispensation.

The baths at the warm spring house are  in Progress and the foundation is laid & the brick prepaired for an  extensive store house & granary and no exheertions are wanting on our part   to push forward the Public works as fast as tithing & means are put into  our hand. They spoke of their great celebration on the 24th July as being a day  long to be remembered. 15 brethren had arived from the gold country  some had plenty of gold some were as destitute as when they went on board  of the ship Brooklin. "The true use of gold was for paving streets   covering houses & makeing culinary dishes & when the saints shall have  preached the gospel raised grain & built up cities enough the Lord will  open up the way for a supply of gold to the perfect satisfaction of his  people. They hadve laid the foundation for a perpetual fund for the  purpose of gathering all the poor saints to Zion who cannot gather them  selves untill all the poor ar gatherd from Council Bluffs, the United  States and all the World And $5,500 isas the first fruits of it is sent  to Kanesvill by the hand of Bishop Hunter to buy oxen to take the   poor with him to Zion this season & then Each year to return to the     
 states with all the money of the perpetual fund to continue to gather  the poor so that when A nation is born in a day they can be removed   the next of necessary. Therey are also resolved to send the gospel  to all the world as soon as Possible. All of the Twelve Apostles who  are in the valley with many others have their mission assigned them to  the Nations. Elder John Taylor accompanied by Curtis E Bolton and  John Pack goes to France: Elder Lorenzo Snow to Italy, & Joseph Toronto   with him. Erastus Snow to Denmark & Peter Hanson, Franklin D.  Richards goes to England accompanied by John S. Higdy George B   Wallace, Job Smith H. W. Church, Joseph W Johnson, Joseph W Young  & Jacob Gates will all go on a mission to cooperate with President   Orson Pratt. Elder John Forsgreen will go on a mission to Sweeden  Elder P. P. Pratt will go on a western Mission to the Islands in the  spring. The above named Elders except P P Pratt have Just arived   in the States. The Epistle also makes the following remarks Elder Orson   Pratt is Doing a great work in England & the cause of truth is ad-  vanceing rapidly in all her home dominions & the rejoiceing of the Saints  causes satan to howl for he is compelled to be subject to the power of   the highest. "Elder Woodruff is located at Cambridgeport Mass  and has been comforting and instructing the saints in Caniala  and the Eastern States the Past year. If Elder Woodruff will gather   up all the saints in his vicinity and come with them to this place He   will be doing a great work and will be opening a way for a visit to those  Nations who have both eyes and ears and are crying to the Elders of Israel  come tell ofus of the things of God for we have heard that God is with  you." They call loudly upon me to gather up all the saints in the Eastern  Country & bring them to Zion to Esstablish Woollen & Cotton factories  & Iron founderies they say there is Iron & coal in good locations not  far distant.      The following is an item of the minutes of the conference  "On motion ^Prest^ Brigham Young was sustained as the first President of the Church  of J.
