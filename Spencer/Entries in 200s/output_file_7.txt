He has addressed a pamphlet of sixteen pages to the Latter Day Saints, scattered abroad, and to every body else, containing his appeals to them, and the cogitations of his own mind.   inspiration came from no higher source than George Miller. He speaks much about being put out of his place and some one also called to fill it. If this had been contemplated, and even carried into effect, the Council of the Church would not have gone beyond their power and right, if they had thought it necessary to be done: But to reproach the person supposed to occupy his place with the appellation of "A LONG EARED JACK ASS," is but to reproach the Council by whom he was appointed, if appointed at all. The spirit of alienation and jealousy is too apparent in his writings: No person has been suggested to fill his place, to my knowledge; and if he had been dictated by the Spirit of the Lord, he would have written a confidential letter to the Council of his brethren, and enquired into all these matters, before venturing to throw out such a volley of most extravagant and uncalled for language as his pamphlet contains. But it seems that he has taken Bishop Miller for his prompter, who lost the Spirit of the Lord by his over anxiety to run forward to Grand Island, to Punkand, and to "  to follow them no longer, when the truth was, he never would follow, but always run ahead. He left the body of the Church without counsel and without the fellowship of the Saints.   nent union and alliance with them, as he now is to sow the seeds of dissension, by scattering his pamphlets among the OUTER BRANCHES of the Church, could he not long ago have sent a messenger to hunt us up, as well as to send one now to distribute his pamphlets, the products of his own misguided zeal, breathing manifestly the spirit of separation from the Church and Council? If we were broken up and gone from Nauvoo, we were not gone out of the world. The very spirit of his apology for not writing to us, clearly shows that he lacked more the inclination to write than the opportunity of sending a letter. This is in accordance with some expressions of his concerning his desire to be accounted as one of the Twelve on his leaving Nauvoo. It may be proper, at some time, to note them.   For one, I can say that I have been ordained to all the power and authority that Bro. Wight ever was, and I can inform him that he is not yet so high that the voice of the Council cannot reach him and bring him down, and even put another in his place if they deem it necessary. Sidney Rigdon was ordained to all that Bro. Wight ever was, and rather more, but the arm and voice of God's Council brought him down and dried up the fountain of his spirits. Lucifer was even higher than Bro. Wight, yet he was thrust down by those with whom he stood connected: and be it known, and known to all, that the Council has power to expel any member of its body from the same, when that member ceases to act pursu- ant to its dictates. If this be not a true doctrine, Lucifer could have stood his ground in heaven and bid as loudly defiance to the powers there, as Bro. Wight has in his pamplet to all the powers of the world, the Church, Angels and men. But the former was cast down, and the Council at the Salt Lake City, with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, must determine the portion of the latter after having canvassed his pamphlet and considered it in connection with this circular.   or property thrown in together as common stock. Though this doctrine has sometimes been practiced by good men, but the original purpose and design of God was to make men accountable for their stewartship, and therefore, "to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;  and to every man according to his  of the martyred prophet of the last days, and the eternal purpose of God, all stand opposed to Bro.

I seat myself once more in this life to make an address to you with pen and ink. I have now lying before me three letters from you of dates—Feb'y 11 (by A. Fielding) June 27 favors I feel thankful; for you may rest assured they operate upon my spirit like a live coal from off the altar and kindles a flame in my soul. I feel to magnify the name of God for the manner he has sustained, inspired and upheld you since the death of Hyrum and the way he is giving a signal victory to the citizens of Zion the city of Joseph. I look upon it myself, as a great omen and evidence that the time has come to favour Zion, and that her Sun and Light must and shall speedily go forth propelled by the spirit and strength of the God of Israel, until Zion arises with all her strength, power, Beauty and Glory until she fully accomplishes all that the ancient prophets anticipated; yea: I rejoice in the prosperity of all, of which your letters speak. My prayers have ascended day and night before God that he would not only do by His servant Brigham Young as he did by Moses but that he would do as much better by him as the greatness labour and work of this dispensation required. ##Joshua 1:1-9## I have also remembered all the Twelve and Elders in all the world. I thank you for all the information and instruction you have given me and of so often speaking of our only son in Zion. We  are all well at present. Our youngest son is two months old, the largest and healthiest child we ever had of his age. All is going on as well as can be expected in this country considering all thinges. the few wise labourers &amp;c. Elder Jones I think is doing well in Wales; he has laboured faithfully and sown much seed that is now taking root and beginning to bring forth much fruit; within a few days past they have baptized two Campbellite Evangelists or ministers and they are ordained priests (I ordained one of them) and a prospect of their doing much good. Brother Jones has preached very extensively in the largest cities and towns through the Welsh domains, and said, there were nearly a hundred added to the branches in that land a few weeks before he left to pay me a visit.   this land according to your request except Elders Holmes and George Town, Masss—they had settled their affairs and were about ready to sail when your letter arrived, and Elder Hardy's family is in such a situation, he is obliged to go home so I did not stop them. But I think we can hold our own until some help comes from Nauvoo. The company of some Elders from there as soon as they get their endowment will meet with a welcome reception in this land. And now while I think of it, I have two requests to make of President Young The first is that he will particularly instruct all Elders who come to this land to see me first before they go into the field and hearken to my counsel and cooperate with me in all things in the vineyard (you will see the reason of this request when you have read the whole of this communcation) and also that you will notify me who have received their endowment and who have not.

Brother Fielding and others escaped only with the skin of their teeth. If an Elder should be caught with 200 letters about his person or in his trunk, nothing could save him. Neither we nor himself could pay the fine. Imprisonment or transportation would be the result, besides ruining us. for if they knew this was done by one of our society their vengeance would be heaped on our heads. I have made this or similar statements in several letters to Nauvoo but it seems to have no effect, however. I pray that this may suffice. All Elders that receive letters should put them all into the Letter bag when they come to the ship. I do not ask any man to send any letter to me only what comes through the post.

I consider that a sense of duty required me to lay before you certain things which have been a source of much grief and sorrow to me since my arrival in England. Some of the reasons why I have not before opened my mind to you upon the subject have been: that I have not wished to trouble your mind with any thing that I could get along without; and it has been much against my will to find fault with my bretheren; and lastly I have lived in hopes of arranging all matters in an amicable manner without calling your attention to the subject at all. But I have at last, come to the conclusion that you ought to know all; you will then understand my position and know how to  and perhaps you may be somewhat surprized at what I am about to reveal to you. At the Death of Joseph, you are well aware, there was a struggle for power among certain men in America.  felt the weight of this Truth in Zion  among men from whom I looked for better things viz: R. Hedlock and T. Ward.   Give men a little extra power and influence for a season. when it is called for they are not willing to give it up or fill their own place and sust I will now give you a statement of facts as near as I can in truth since my arrival in Liverpool.   covered a coldness and distance on the part of Elder Hedlock to- wards me, but much more so towards Brother Clark. After spending a few days in getting settled I began to make inquiry into the affairs of the office. Brother Hedlock said the account books were there I could examine them. The books not being kept in a systimatical order I could not readily comprehend things. I soon saw every exertion was made to prejudice my mind against Brother Clark. The Spirit against him was of such a nature that I saw he could never work with Brother Hedlock. In fact the accusations against him were of such a nature and urged so warmly I was obliged to make it almost my first business to trace up the accusations against him to the fountain head through all it's windings. It appeared to me to be like great groanings among the mountains to bringforth a mouse. it ended in this fact: he had kissed somebody. In my opinion it was more to keep him out of the Emigration business than to clear the church of crime. After I settled this up I advised him to take charge of some conference for a season until there was a better feeling at Liverpool.   recommendation published with it that the Saints might know that I came with authority from the proper source.   Hedlock and Ward seemed to be much troubled about their standing so I made choice of them for councillors out of respect to the men and their former standing, thinking they would operate with me. There was nothing in the Star but that all was right. but the more I advanced towards my place as President to take charge of affairs and direct them, the more I found a spirit against it and secretiveness in all things especially with Bro. Hedlock; and Brother Ward had so much of John Bull in him, it seemed at times that it was of more consequence to him than the Priesthood. And as out of the heart the mouth speaketh I soon saw things in their hearts not right if I could judge from the course they were pursuing. their feelings were "We have power &amp; influence and we will hold it." Brother Hedlock continues to carry on business his own way without consulting me in scarcely anything unless I dragged it out of him, and knowing it was my place and duty to understand what was going on I inquired into matters until in several instances he insulted me in the office and manifested much anger in the midst of considerable company, and as I would not quarrel with him, at least, in company, I quit the room. when he got mad he would say how much the Twelve were laying up from his labours and he ought to have his share of it as well as they. In several instances he threatened of leaving the office and going home at once. As he had threatened it so much I finally told him, I did not care how quick he went. "Yes" then says he "I know that is what you want, to get rid of me and get Brother Clark and you will do well enough." There has been so much of this spirit that there has been no union. I have been a speckled bird and stranger among them until it has caused me tears and sorrow by day and night. I have grown old under it.

We have rented a new respectable office for three years. he has rented it in his own name, he is also selling a part of it in his own name. In fact he does all business in his own name without any regard to me whatever as touching Emigration &amp; Renting rooms, and one would think from his actions that he was laying a foundation to spend generations to come upon his own look in Liverpool. He has been to much expense this season in publishing large handbills and cards in his own name and scattered them all over the kingdom as a general shipping agent without consulting me at all upon these things. He is so secret in his movements and singular in his habits that neither myself nor any man about the office knows where he lives or boards, neither can I find out, though I have asked him several times. He counts it an insult to be asked the question He has kept the Temple Books until lately and signed all the re- ceipts in his own name. he has manifested a spirit to gain all the influence possisble. I had a plain talk with Elder Ward a short time since upon the subject, (as I had heard much testimony from others what they had said behind my back) I told Brother Ward I knew my place and my counsellors ought to know it also. I informed him they could not grease, soap or swallow me. that if they undertook to ride me they would find a hard seat before they got through. I told him that Brigham Young and not Reuben Hedlock was President of the church, and if Hedlock had power and influence the Presidency of the Church had given it to him, and if he were in the way of his duty he would throw that influence into the channel where it ought to be, for the stream had run out of the channel long enough. I told him it was time for me to have License for Emigration and for my name to appear upon the door post and sign boards, hand-bills and cards as well as R.  Hedlock's. Elder Hedlock had found fault because I had interfered with the Temple Books, but I have gone forward and taken them into my own possession and the Temple money also.   to go as publisher of the Star, so it has found a place there; since I took a decided stand upon the subject they have yielded in a  degree, but I do not at the present time know the income and outgo of the emigration. Hedlock attends to that, keeps his own books he does not consult me upon the subject. if he converses on the subject it is to some one besides me. When I have conversed with him upon the subject, he has said when the debts he had contracted were paid he would give it up. He has also the Music Hall rented in his own name. I do not think myself that Bros Hedlock is a suitable person to conduct the Emigration here. I think he has charge of it as long as is for our good. I think he does not manifest the economy at all times that our circumstances require. There has been much said at times about how much he has paid out of his own pocket in carrying on business here, but he had nothing when he came, and all his generosity, freedom and expense have been at the expense of the office. They made a collection among all the churches a short time before I came, to pay the the debt for emigrating the poor, which they divided between them. I do not know what it amounted to, perhaps £50 or so. but I gave much offence because I inquired into it. In the midst of all this there are times when Brother Hedlock manifests a desire by words to do what good he can and help to roll on the work but he has a very strange way of showing it since I have been here. My arrival here was far from being welcome by those who were in the office at Liverpool. I was informed, Elder Hedlock said when he heard I was coming that I was a very tight pernicious, close man. Thomas Wilson, a man with them in the office said, if that were the case, I was not needed in England. There has been a spirit manifested here that they were afraid they would not get pay enough for what they did. Taking all these things into con- sideration I do not think things will go right until Brother Hedlock is called home, and transfers the business ^over^ into my hands. I shall then know what shape it is in, but if the way he is doing business so much out of sight was to be continued in the same way for five years, I would be as much in the dark about it at the end as I am now. I think if you should counsel him to come home and transfer all matters into my hands, that he would begin to think something about it. I do not wish you to let them know that I have made a communication of this kind to you for I think the easiest way to get along is for him to be counselled to come home.

They will neither of them attend meetings in Liverpool at all unless it is on some peculiar occasions. The American Elders see and understand these things and are with me in heart and spirit. These men that ought to have been my support have caused me much sorrow. In fact I have had no place or person with whom I could mingle my prayers before God only with my wife, or by chance meet an American Elder or some congenial spirit wandering to and fro. So if all things have not been conducted as you would wish in every respect, since I came here I trust you will make some allowance for my situation. I want the anointed of the Lord to remember me in their prayers that I may have power to fulfill my place and and station and overcome every ob- satcle, and I am resolved to wage a warfare with both men and devils in the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the Keys of the Kingdom of God until I can stand in the lot and station that  me.

Any counsel you have to give me I will abide by it according to the best of my ability. When men undertake to pull me down ^here^ they try to pull you down, and when they pull you down they pull the Kingdom of God down; but thank God they cant come it. I know that God is with you and I know he is with me in this land, and I shall do what I can for the page torn cause.

He is a very capable, useful, business man if he takes a right course. I have not brought up any of these things wishing to make an accusation or case of trial of them, but that you might know the truth of my circumstances and know how to pray for me. With regard to the Joint Stock Company, Elders Hedlock Ward and Wilson are the main officers in it at present. I think there was a Spirit manifested in some degree at it's organization against my being a director in it, but at that time I did not wish it and refused to have as I had so much on hand, but as most of the members and directors are members of the church I think they will hearken to our counsel upon the subject. I have tried in all my counsel and Teachings to impress upon the minds of all, the importance and necessity of walking by the counsel of the Presidency of the Church, and I think they will do it. They find it much more  expensive than they expected to get registered according to Act of Parliament and to get the Seal of State. It will cost over £100 (pounds).   to say that in the midst of all our affairs, there has been no spirit manifested by them that they wanted to apostatize and leave the  had and to get more, if even it was at my expense.

I find no scriptures satisfactory to prove that they ever were done away theirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancient days &amp; likewise should people at this day like as did the apostles &amp; exercise the faith that did Isaac that those gifts might again be on the earth and in case of sickness we might  loock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm of  flesh. we read of a  of many physicians &amp; had spent all that she had &amp; was nothing better but rather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ. should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasent  day undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lord told Ezekial their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the house of israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information   &amp; ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received) ENDENTRY          you &amp; of asking a few qustions which you will do me a great favor by Answering the Next Mail so that I may get some information upon a subject in which I am much interested I sent by Brother Horner one year ago this fall $1552.40 in United States Gold to be forwarded on his arrival in the States to  Never received any of that Money nor heard any thing from it on from Brother Horner up to the 5 Letter I got this Mail.

Since I have been on my Eastern Mission, while meeting with the saints, And teaching them the first Principles of the gospel, the Epistle of the Twelve, their gathering &amp; building up Zion, the signs of the, times. the gathering of the Jews, And the certain judgments of  God which Await the Nations of the Earth (And further than this your servant has neither  taught nor practiced) I have been filled from time to time with the spirit of God And a deep sense of the awful judgments of A Justly Angry God which stands like a storm already gatherd And ready to burst upon the Nations of the Earth Esspecially   for his blessing to me thus far on my mission. Elders Carter, Appleby have been labouring more or less during the past summer &amp; winter in these Eastern States. And they almost universally make one report  if they do get a congregation together the word is like throwing A Ball against A rock, it bounds back, or like pouring water onto a gooses back it runs off, And does not pene- trate. they cannot get their bread among them, or means to travel, but have to call upon the churches in order to live. I have generally found the same indifference manifest  by the world whare I have travelled, but few come out to hear &amp; but few have been Baptized. I baptized 3 in New Haven, Br Rockwood 3, And Brother Appleby several in Philadelphia, &amp; Cream Ridge, &amp; several Baptized in other parts. I gave Elder Appleby council to visit the Saints in Pennsylvania &amp; New Jersey from time to time as he had An opportunity And preach as doors were open. The question might be asked by some why are the people of this Nation so indifferent about hearing or Embracing the gospel while the work is rolling like fire in dry stubble in other Nations. I view this Nation in as bad a state at least as the Jews were After puting the saints And Jesus to death, their day of visitation in a great measure had past. This Nation in like manner have stoned And killed the Prophets, shed the Blood of the Lords anointed, rejected the gospel, And driven the entire Church And Kingdom of God with those bearing the oricles there of into the Mountains of Israel,  the Temple of the Lord, Justly cut off the Nation from the Church And Kin for their Abominations, wickedness And Bloody, deeds. In Addition to this since that period, the sins of this Nation have Apparently increased fourfold commencing with the sin of sodomy adding Every other named in the black catalogue of crime, untill it is like A flood that overflows its banks, And it seams as though not ownly the Holy Ghost but that portion of the spirit of God that was given to Enlighten every man that came into the world was taken its departure from the people, And they are going like the ox to the slaughter &amp; know not the Approach of their destruction ENDENTRY  &amp;  Elder Stratton will give an account of them.   sickness in our company as was the case with all the company Herd from their was 7 deaths in our company 3 children,  2 women &amp; 2 Men, one of which was Samuel Smith.

Had a long intrview with Mr. Benson yesterday and he exceedingly desires to do business with us he says if he does it for nothing. I was much pleased with my interview with him. He a appears to me to be a gentleman. I think it will be well to keep upon good terms with him as far as possible.  I would life like to have Emigration continue as fast as doors are open either by sea or lands, but I think it right for us to see our way vlear clear in chartering ships. by getting subscriptions among the Saints for that purpose before running any risks, that would be detrimential to the course and a disadvantage to the Church. I like the spirit manifested by Mr. Benson with my interview with him yesterday. And as far as you can, do business with him as cheap as elsewhere. I would prefer to continue business with him, as he appaarently manifests much interest in our welfare. I hope the Lord will open your way to get a goodly number out by fall if not before. Bro.

I class the Navajoe, Moquie and Apaches with the Laman of many Indian tribes of America. I class the Zunies, Lagoonies and Islatus among the Nephites. (See Sec. 3, 17 verse, D. &amp; C.). The Zunies are in advance of the Navajoes, Apaches, or any other Laman- ites. The Lagoonies are much above the Zunies, and the Islatus are far above them all in wealth, in beauty, cleanliness and order of their homes and persons, the adornment of their dwellings, their in- dustry and indefatigable labors, the virtue and purity of their na- tio strangers and, above all else, the expansion of their minds and cap- ability of receiving any principle of the Gospel,  sealing powers, fully equal to the mind of any of the Anglo Saxon ENDENTRY  no other  settlements it leaves the tithing wheat   they are in a New  for storeing tithing grain.

He had arrived safe at San Juan after en- countering huricanes and snow storms. He found only 2 men and 3 women and 8 child- ren in the settlement, and they had a fright from a report that the Utes was coming to destroy all on the river, but they did not do  it. Soon 3 men arrived from Silas Smiths Company. they were still hemmed up and could not travel, no road, had to blast thier way with powder of which they were out. They said it would take 300 lbs. more powder   Smith had gone back to obtain the powder to accomplish it. It seems quite a mistake for companies to undertake to travel a road with women and children in the winter, that has not been explored. I think we should avoid a repetition of it. I have heard the new boat   to hear it. I wish president Taylor and Council would change the name of that ferry. I do not like the name. If it was changed perhaps there might not be as many Ghosts visit it and scare the women as there has  been in days that are past. There has been strange stories told by the sisters who have been to work there. We are beginning to have cold weather in Arizona of late. Thermom- eter has been showing for several mornings past from zero to 6 degrees below which is  an uncommon thing for this country. I expect Sunset people will finish threshing tomorrow. Head to go to Snowflake and borrow thier machine as the Clawson ma- chine refuses to do any more threshing this season. They will have about 3200 bushels, which is less than what I expected, yet 2/3 of all the Mormons of Arizona are looking to these figures for thier years bread. It should read  harvest. But Sunset are doing all they can for the needy.

The Islatus of which I speak is a village twelve miles be- low Rio Del Norte, containing 3000 souls that stand at the head of this class of men that I cal They occupy forty villages, containing a population of 32,000, speak- ing sixteen distinct languages, but nearly all good Spanish scholars. I look upon this as a great field of missionary labor for some forty good, faithful "Mormon" Elders, who should be able to speak the Spanish, and I hope next Conference will call some of them, at least, into the field. I visited this people, located in their homes, in company with Brother Ammon M. Tenney, who had visited most of them before and I think has done much good in opening doors among them. He had baptized 115 of the Zunies on a former mission. My journey and visit with him was a visit of observation and I was amply paid. In what way, I do not know, but in almost e they were looking for me. I can only make a brief outline from my  journal of our journey. On the 19th of Augu village, containing about 3000 souls. The village stood on a piece of ground; many buildings three stories high, the upper stories en- tered by ladders at the top. There had been a heavy struggle in this village between the Catholics and Mormon Zunies. The priests had done all they could to lie about the Mormons and had drawn away a few who had been baptized, but others remained firm. I went through the old Catholic cathedral in the village; it looked as though it were 500 years old. It had two bells hanging in the tower and over the pulpit was some of the finest carved work in wood I ENDENTRY  ^was^ two miles wide but done No damage  here wheat all in the slioh silo at Sunset &amp;  &amp; 20 acres of cane made up, ownly they got wet was 5 acres of squashes, but they are now being Gathered Brothe Jaques says that Earnest Young was picked up Drunk in the  street &amp; found Dead in the morning. if  it was lawful for a man to give utterance to his thoughts I would say it was a good thing, and would be if a few more  follow suit Salt Lake City would be  better off.
