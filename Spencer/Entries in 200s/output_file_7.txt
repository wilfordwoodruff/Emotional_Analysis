 The following are some of the important wordsthat flowed from President Youngs lips as headdressed the people and called upon themloudly to repent he said you must stop yourswearing, you must stop your cheating, you muststop your lying, you must stop your stealingyou must stop your horedoms you muststop your back biteings, speaking evil of theTwelve speaking evil of me, you must stopthese things & put away your wickednessor you will be damned, you will be destroyedyou will be visited by pestilence and plagueand by the sword, and you will fall to theground and I warn you and fore warn you of these things if you do not repentyes councellors, High Priest and Eldershere in the Camp of Israel will say I willde damned if I will pay my tithing or ifI will do this or that, if God was like manHe would hurl you down to Hell & letyou lie and welter there a thousandyears and his mercy ownly keeps you outthere are many here that are corrupt androtton at the core and I have no more fellowship for them than I have forJohn C Bennett if I fellowship these things it will drag me down to Hell withyou and I will not do it brother Joseph being a vary merciful man bore withthese things untill it took his life butI will not do it men get led away by degrees untill the devil gets possession of there tabernacle and they are led captiveat the will of the devil and now I saythat those who are calculating to continue 
 in wickedness and serve the devil had bettergo no further with this camp they had better go to Missouri and spend the rest of thertime with the gentiles for I can swear to them if they go with us & continuethere wickedness there heads shallbe served from theie tabernacles and thedevils that are in them shall go and have no tabernacles to dwell in thetruth of the matter is there are manyplaces we pass through that have been theslaughter ground of the ancient Nephitesand Lamanites and the spirits of Devils arehovering around it and if you are not onyour guard they will enter you and leadyou captive at their will for if you arenot governed by the spirit of God you willbe by the spirit of the devil. and if youare governed by the spirit of God while in such places and they cannot enter any of you they will try to enter yourcattle your beast, for they want to entersome tabernacle as they did the swinein ancient days. I had rather go to themountains with the Twelve alone andnot to have another soul with us thanto have those who will not be subjectto the Priesthood but practice wickednessand serve the devil for if we continue with this company and they do notrepent the righteous will fall with thewicked. There are people now in this campwho are stealing hay and wood and I knowwho they are will I fellowship them no I will not and because we know who isguilty of wickedness they think we are 
 fellowshiping them and doing the same ourselves but it is not so and Joseph sufferedmuch from the same cause because heknew of the rascality and wickednessHis enemies and many of the saints thoughthe was guilty of it himself the truth of the matter is those who are leading theHouse of Israel while in the path of thereduty know the wickedness that is amongthe people it cannot be hid from themfor they are in vision all the time.I will now look a little upon the otherside of the question I will say however that if we are a mind to be subject tothe will of the devil, Death, Hell and thegrave we may be & bow down to it allthe day long or we may have perfect power and triumph over it. who am Isurrounded by, by men who arhave enteredinto covenant with God, have recievedendowments in the temple and are calledto be saviors upon mount Zion, to save whoour Fathers and Israel clear back to FatherAdam who are still lying in there gravesand waiting for the redemption of therebodies through your instrumentality, thenwill you curs, swear, lie, steal, commit adulteyand take the name of God in vain puttysaviors you would be, O shame God and Angels would blush at such conduct. thenrepent and do the work appointed yoomany men are overtaken in a fault desireto repent and turn to God shall we castsuch away Nay but bear with them 
 as God bears with us we cannot be sanctifyedall at once, but have to be tried and placed in all kinds of shapes and proven to theutmost to see whether we will serve the Lordunto the end so that we may be safe whenwe come into the Celestial Kingdom of God and not do as Lucipher did the first timean oppertunity is offered rebel againstGod and the Council of Heaven and be hurled down to Hell in a manner that you could notbe redeemed at all and you must not sinmurmur and complain while in the midst of your trials because you have been mobedand tried even to the utmost it is no excuse foryou to commit a wicked deed take the name ofGod in vain, or to do any evil, now all of you quit it repent and turn to God and youshall be blessed notwithstanding I havethus reproved you I consider you the bestpeople as a body there is on the earth andif there was any better I would go to them and take you with them thatdesired to go. In speaking of the redemptionof our dead I would say there are millions thatdied from the days of Adam to Christ that arewaiting for there bodies to be raised butfew arose in comparison to the number at theresurrection of Christ and they weresome that had the priesthood or fulness ofit sealed upon them after making many other usful remarks he closed by blessingthe people believing they would repentThe remarks of president Young made adeep impression upon the congregationand I trust there will spedily be a refermationin the Camp of Israel

 [FIGURE]On my return home from CouncilI looked over my Journal for 1846and the result of my labours willbe found on another pageAnd thus another year has past andgone into eternity and has bourn itsreport to God of me and all othermen. I still live upon the earthwith my brethren the Twelvewhile many of my brethren havebeen called into the eternal worldwhatever I may have done or leftundone not pleasing in the sightof my Heavenly Father I ask Godmy Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ his Son to forgiveme and give me grace according to my day during the year to come and give me power and adisposition to do good all the days of my life be they few ormany and to save myself andhousehold and all committed to mycharge. One year ago this night I was in Liverpool England butthis night finds me in the midstof the Camp of Israel, at winterquarters in the Omaho Nation in thewilderness in the land of Joseph surrou-nded by the Lamanites who are poorwreched and miserable and have beenso for many generations in consequ-ence of the sins of there forefathers 
 According to the prophesies of the Prophet Lehi we have been rejected by the gentiles on this land or continant even the land of Joseph and the gentiles have shed the blood of the Prophets and Patriarchs JOSEPH &  HIRAM and others and have sought the lives of the Apostles and Saints and have driven us out of their mids and there by have rejected the Kingdom of God with the keys, oracles, & revela-tions thereof which we have taken with us, which remain with us this day in the Camp of Israel and my prayer to God is that they may remain with us and our Posteritythrough all time and through all Eternity and that the same blessings may spedily go to the Lamanites and that 1847 may not pass away untill the Lamanites with their Chiefs may begin to recieve the gospel which the gentiles have reject-ed and cast out of their midst and that the Lord will spedily deliver us entirely out of their hands and avenge the spilt blood of the Prophets and that they may cease to spoil and be spoiled and that they may feel the chastning rod of the Almighty and know there is a God in Israel 
 AD. 1846 has been a day of the sacrafice of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Through the fatigues and labours & exposers of the Saints many have been laid in the grave I have my-self been called to part withtwo of my sons which God hath given me they lie in the dust untillthe ^resurrection^ and I came nigh being killed by accident by the fall of a tree which broke my breast bone and three ribs but through the great goodness of God I was preserved and have recoverd and still live for which I feel to render the gratitude of my heart to my Heavenly Father and I pray my Heavenly Father to lengthen out my days to behold the House of God stand upon the tops of the Mountains and to see the Standard of Liberty reared up as an ensign to the nations to come unto to serve the Lord of Hosts I Pray that my Brethren the Twelve may be preserved to esstablish Zion upon the mountains of Israel and lead the Camp of Israel to a land of Peace, health and safety all these blessings I ask God my Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood AMEN

 N. Y. Citty Dec. 6th 1840Dear WillfordI presume you will be somewhat surprised when you learn where this letter was written but perhapse not more than I was when I went to my door in Iowa and saw brother J. F. Carter and L. Scammans ride up to the door I could hard think it possible that they could be there but truly strange things happen in these last days, they came on to see the country and stoped with me about 6 days and insisted on my accompanying them home and spending the winter at home and then if I wished I could return with you in the spring so we left Montrose on the 16 of Nov. and arrived here yester-day we have had a good and safe passage thus far and tolerable good health. our dear little babe was some unwell two or thre days with the chills and fever but I procured some of the tonic mixture and gave him and it helped him so he is quite smart now. My health is good accepting some cold occasioned by traveling. I hope to be comfortably situated in my fathers house before you re-ceive this as we expect to leave here tomorrow for Maine. We are now at brother Iluse's he has got a verry pleasent girl for a wife about 18 years old. You told me in your last communication that you was going to send me some money and wished me to spend it in some ^the^ way that would make me the most comfortable so I thought that way would be to go home and spend the winter with my relatives hope to see you in Maine in the spring I packed up my things and left them at father Clarks where I have been living and left them in their care with my heifer the cow I let a widow woman have for her milk she is to keep her for her milk untill my return. I have not heard from you since last july or your letter was dated th 6th of July where in you mentioned brother Turley's return home and mentioned writing and sendingme some things by him he had not arrived when when we left but was expected daily as we heard he had left N.Y. with his company for Montrosebut it was getting so late in the season that we dared not wait any longer so I borrowed 15 dolls. of sister Taylor and told I saw and engaged sisterKimbal to take charge of the things you sent until our return and to pay 
 pay sister Taylor the sum of money I borrowed of her if you sent any and left word to have your letters forwarded to me in Maine I feel verry anxious to hear from you more so since you went to London. I feel verry thankful that the Lord has blessed you in your ministry in the maner that he has since you have been gone from home but Oh! how long you have been gone sometimes my heart almost sinks within me when I think how long you have been gone and the scenes that I have passed through since you left me and was I to dwell upon it I should sink beneath itbut hitherto the Lord has supported me. do tell me when you think you will be at home the next time when you write if you camn I often get quite impatient weighting your return. Could I have taken our little Sarah east with me it seames as though I should have been happy but Ah! I had to leave her remains in Commerce while I went east with my little Willy but not without first visiting her grave and strewing it with leaves, but I leave this subject. The church in Commerce and Iowa is increaseing verry fast som some things are taking place in the church which are bad but bu I will tell you more about it whenyou come home which I hope and trust will be in the spring and hope you will be prepared fo with meanes to take me back in the spring ^with you^ although I expect my friends will be opposed to my going back and that was the greatest and only objection that I had to going home perhapse they may change my mind upon the subject but I hope not. I want you to write often for I think you do not feel as lonely as I do. Father Clark's family have been verry kind to me ever since I have been there and they wish to be remembered to you. I have sent you as many as eight or nine letters since Iyou left N.Y. and paid the postage on them to N.Y. I feel verry sorry that you do not get them. I have not received any papers from you in Eng. should be much pleased to read them hope you will bring a coppy of them home with you and some hymbooks. I have lately received a letter from sister Eunice they were well—father Carter's family are well— I should be glad to call on father Woodruff's family as I go along but shall not have time as it is so late in the season. I should be glad 
 to see see some of the Saints here in N.Y. but have no opportunity to call on them neither should I know where to find them. I must write a line to sister Eunice so that I must close by wishing to be remembered by Willford  to all the American brethren and all the Saints around you likewise particularly brother Kingstons family I should be glad to fill this sheet but cannot for want of roomtime. Do remember wme and Willy in all your pray[ers]So good night my dear W.  P. W. WoodruffWillford WoodruffI suppose you have no objections to my comeing east I was advised to do so by many

 Vinalhaven March 1st 1838Beloved WillfordAccording to your request, I seat myself this eve. to pen a few lines to you after haveing just, returned from fatherLuces' (where I have been spending a few days) to brother Amese's. I passed bybrother Stephen Luces' where the brethren have met for meeting—thinkingI would spend the time in writing to you. Brother Ball arrived herelast eve. and brought me a billet from you to day which I was gladto receive. The church here are strong and well engaged likewise theopposers are engaged to. Mr. Carter has held two mock meetings here of late,he has a written manuscript which he has been collecting through thepast winter from newspapers &c which he reads to the people withhymns addapted to the occasion. brother Ames and Valentine attended thefirst meetting and bore a noble testimony for the truth they saidthey never had so much liberty in speaking before, many people sawthe contrast between the two spirits—but none of the brethren attendedthe last meeting. I have received three letters for you but no papers; one letterwas from Mother  Woodruff bearing date of Dec. 31st wherein in she saysthat she has been quite sick but has far recovered also that Eunice and fatherwere well and that her faith was encreaseing in the faith of latter Day Saintsand that nothing short of it would satisfy her mind &c. &c.—another frombrother Asahel wherein he acknowledges the reception of your lastletter—his remarks are more favourable than than sometimes—says thathe heard brother Joseph preach in Terra Haut last fall &c.. The thirdwas from brother Milton he mentions that your much esteamed lettercame to hand and was gladly received—he had concluded almost that youhad not received his—he likewise received one from Kirtland the same daydated Jan. 14th wherein he received information concerning matters in K. he 
 requests you to let no one but me know of it—he writes in confidence to you—says thatJoseph and Sidney took their families Saturday night and it is supposed theyhave gone to Missourie and the word is for all to follow that possibly can toescape the destruction that is comeing upon K. There is a great division there anda number have left the church and raised what they call a standard of truthand liberty and drew up a remonstration against wickedness and the procedings that have been illegally, takeing for their guide the book of Mormon thebible the and covenants for their guide. I will mention some of their namesN. Milliken and wife, John Gayland and wife, W. Parish and wife, J. F.Boynton and wife Martin Harris and wife, Leonard Rich and wife, JosephCoe and wife, Sarah Lowell, and Aphia, and many others but I hope notWillford and Phebe—there was about thirty five that signed the remonstrance, but the letter stated that there was thousands of the same opinion.The high counsil met and cut them all of from the church. Doct Cowdry has withdrawn from the church, the printing office has been taken and soldfor Joseph's and Sidney's debts N. Millikens bid it off, therefore we shall nothave the papers at present. I am verry sorry for that for there is much eccitement [excitement] here already about the delay of the papers and I suppose that they have the sameaccount here in the papers that you saw, some of them have already written tothe Post Masters in Cleaveland and Kirt. to learn the truth of these things althoughit is kept private here now. O Willford what is this world comeing to. my heart almostshrinks within me when I look around on the state of things. Brother Ballhas received a letter from his Mothers family in Boston requesting him to returnto them and he thinks of starting in 8 or 10 days. I rather expect that he willbaptize Mr. Ephraim Luce and Lucy Fry as they have been waiting for an oppo-rtunity most ever since you lelft. Brother Ames has had his case tried and the costwas trown upon him. Mr Douglass has been in a great rage about you he saysthat he will spend all his property in law with you but that he will have hischaracter cleared up, he has applied to two Justices for an execution against you but 
 but they told him that it was between ministers and they did not wish to meddelewith it, but brother Crocket has come over to this district and says that he is morecalme than he was. I really hope that he will not procede with his suit for it willonly make trouble. I have almost forgotten to tell you that Milton has given up goingto Kirt. next spring and wants to come down here in the spring—wants to meet you inScarborough thinking that you will accompany me there in the spring he wants youto write to him, says that he wishes he was with you here now. Brother and sisterAmes Valentine and Melana send there best respects to you and say they are trying todo as well as they can. I think they are. Sister Brown and sister Sabra are here ona visit and send there love to you and say that the church is doing well there.They have just come in from meeting and say they have had a verry goodmeeting, that brother Crocket was wide awake. You did not say any thing aboutthe time that you expected to return here, your three weeks have almost expiredand they have been long enough I think. I realy feal lonely here without my [page torn]but I trust that the Lord will take care of him and return him to me inhis time. I dont forget to ask him to daily and trust that I am not forgottenby him. My health is good at present but I have been quite sick with a coldI was much pleased to hear that brother Townsend had joined your companyGive my best respects to him and tell him that I want to see him.Milton's letter was sealed with black and there was greate enquiery concerningthe contents, but I did not let them know of the Kirtland affairs, some of themhere surmise that a mob has arisen and demolished the press in Kirtlandif but I shall keep the letter private untill you come and then you maydo as you think best with it. I think that these times will try the faithof the saints but I think that I feael as strong as ever. C There will begreat persecution for thes things but there is a God in Israel yet thanks beto God for it. I have not commenced your coat yet but shall soon. I recollectthat this is your birthday would be glad to congratulate you upon the same could I havethe privilege. This is from your Phebe who is waiting as patiently as she can for your return.It is most twelve therefore I bid you good night and retire to restP. W. W.

 Kirtland Geauga County Ohio Nov 29th 1836Brother Asahel H. WoodruffDear SirAs I have just taken my pen from a sheet directed to our Distantparents I thought pirhaps it would not be amiss toaddress a few lines to you as I have never had any reason tobelieve that you had lost that friendship or attachment towardsme that I formerly have been made the partaker of an opportunityafforded. Notwithstanding years have rolled away between us sincewe saw each other face to face yet my attachment towards youor my desire for your wellfare either in temporal or spiritual thingshath not either lessoned or abated. It certainly is gratifying to me to hear of the prosperity of my Brethren in evey lawfulpursuit Brother Asahel I have long felt anxious to againhear from you I am sensible that it is not alltogether profitable to be always pouring upon any ones mind any subject however goodit may be lest be be weary in consequence of which I have remainedmore silent upon those subjects in which I have been ingaged than Iotherwise should have done. But thinking perhaps you would like toKnow whare I was how & what I was doing I concluded to call yourmind to the perusal of this sheet. I would here rema^r^k that afterour last conference in the south I spent a few days in visting the Churches which God had rased up by my instrumentality in that countryI had a good season amo[n]g them I added 9 to their numbers &took the parting hand I took water at Paducah K.Y. on the 25 th of Oct after passing one boat that had sunk & run aground ourselv[es]traveled 400 miles we reached Luisville I then went by land to Owenton,& spent two weeks preaching & visiting some Kinsman of Elder Snoots a travling Brother from Tenne who is with me we then wentto Cincinnati visited the big bone lick on the road the place wharethose large bones are taken that have been exhibited in Europe &America. When I arived at Cincinnati My first business was to inquire at the store of Webster & Conway for you they toldme you had located at Terrehaute Indianna & I was glad to learnfrom them that the prospects for your prosperity was flattering 
 Cincinnati is much of a place of business I sayw while there the Dead & woundedtaken from the Flora caused by the bursting of the connecting pipes I took water at Cincinnati for Wellsville rising of 400 miles I also passed another boatthat had run against a snag store her hull & sunk at Wellsville I tookthe stage to Kirtland 90 miles & whene I arived at Kirtland I was almostasstonished I at the alteration in the place since I was there in May1834 for when I left there was but few buildings & most of them shantiesbut now on my returen I fou^n^d a city as it were arising from the hills& dales & a temple standing in its midsts with its steeple pointingtowards heaven in honor of that God who commanded it be built& framed the materials of which it was made. It was truly a happyseason to my soul to again meet the inhabitants of Kirtland those withwhom I had endured perils & tribulations I visited the house of the lord &its contents & I saw that which I did not expect to behold in my generation& among these things I say the Egyptian mummies & also the Book of Abram written by his own hand in ancient form. On last sabbathI had the privelege of going up to the house of the Lord in Kirtland to worship with my Beloved Brethren I kno not ownly had the privilege ofhereing the word of God in company with about 1,000 Saints from thesacred desk but also of declaring the word of God unto them. my happinesshath been great to behold the work of God in these last days & Allthoughthe gentiles rages & the priest imagin vain things yet the work of God will roll onin spite of all these things untill babylon shall fall Israel be gathered & ChristreignI am mow about to commence a coursof study perhaps shall enter school on the morrow what length of tim[e] itwill take me to accomplish it I am unable to say I may spend the privatepart of my time for several years in this place. I intend to leave school inthe spring a sufficient time to visit my parents & frends in the east & proclaimthe gospel unto them I expect to spend the ^ensuing^ summer in Connecticut Iam perfectly reconciled with my lot in life I never enjoyed myself better inlife than at present. I am now experiencing what I have looked for severalyears ownly the blessings of God are greater than I ever expected to behold. enjoy or even hear from in my generation if you evertravel through this county I desire you to visit Kirtland once more asI understood yesterday by Elder Johnston that you called upon himin this place & inquired for me I supposed at It was a year or 
 two since I would have been glad to have seen you Ihope the day may come when you may have the privelegeof fully investigating the cause in which I am engaged forI believe your honesty & dissermment would lead youto imbrace it I have found one thing to be true thatwhen we seek first the Kingdom of God all things els mecessarywill be added. I should consider it one of the greatest blessingson earth to have you & the rest of my Kinsman becomemembers of the Church of Latter day Saints & why I desire it is because I know it to be the true Churchof Christ & my friends would be exhalted beforeGod & receieve blessings that fadeth not away I certanlycould have no motive to desire my friends to receievedarkness or error But I certainly have a chance [&]know the reality of these things as well at least as thosewho are out of the Church & not been privilegedwith as closan close an inspection as myself yea & evenour enemies in this county are beginning to acknowl[edge]of a truth it is in vain to raise their hands against [page torn]great ene[mies] await us I would to God my friends were [page torn]for them this world is passing the things of time are transitorythe things of the Celestial Kingdom [a]re eternal & worth possessingI desire to meet you there. My hart hath also been muchpenetrated for Brother Azmon I have loved that Brother I love him yet I shall still plead before God for him I haveno other than the best of feelings towards him Although I amignorant of his feelings towards me the Lord knows I wishall of my relatives well & if they knew what I know ^not wishing to boast^ they wouldbe up & doing but as it was in the days of Lot & Noah so will itbe when Christ apperars. [##Matthew 24:37##] Is it possible that I cannot have a natural Brother [to] partake with me the glory of God in these last Days I have thought the former Dealings of God with youwas preparing you for theis great work I trust time will yetproove it to be so I shall pray for it at least write to me whenconvnent Direct to Kirtland Ohio (this place) if you haveopportunity call & see me it would be a great privelege to meyours with the best of feelings & wishesW.

 Bowery 88. New York City, Dec. 13th. 1839.My Dear Phebe.Notwithstanding I sent you a long letter abouttwenty days since; I feel disposed to address you at this time; & could Ibut read a letter from you half as often as I write to you I should feelexceding thankful: but I make allowances for Sickness & miscarriageof letters &c. I have recieved one letter from you & that was great consola-tion to my feelings. This is the fifth letter I have written to you & Ido hope that you have obtained them, the last letter I wrote Nov 24th whichI truly hope you will get. When you write to me please be particular totell me how many of my letters you have received & the dates of them. Iam in great hopes that I shall have a letter from you before I leave theCity for the City England. I never more highly prised the worth of letter writing than since I left home. I suppose of course that you wish to know howmatters & times are with me & have been since I last wrote &c. I continuedpreaching in New Jersey, had full congregations, many were believing, some were embracing, & a warm & friendly feeling manifest by almost the wholecountry whare I was. Elder P. P. Pratt called to see us, preached one, &informed me that a conference was appointed in New York City on the12th inst & wished me to attend I have done so & am now in the City."the following I copy from my Journal. Dec 11th I took the parting hand with Elder James& Brother Ivins & left them at 1 o'clock at night & rode 16 miles to Freehold. Ithere took Stage at daylight & rode 12 miles to Middletown point, there tookSteem Boat Wane sailed 30 miles to N. Y. City arived at 12 oclok. I entered the city"& found it full of armed Soldiers spedily preparing for war thee Steem Boatswere chartered to conveyed them to Albany to fight several thousand Du-Dutchman that ware citizens near Albany that had strongly fortified themselveswith canon & small arms, it is said they will not pay their tokens or depts orsumthing or other of that kind, & so they are going to fight about it, how much"Blood will be shed I dont know. at any rate it is beginning to be war & sum"our through America & Europe & all things are in commotion. After diningin King stret, I called upon Elder P. P. Pratt in Mott street No 58 found him & fam-ily well. Elders P. P. Pratt & J. Ball accompayed me to the post office. I receivedtwo letters one from Eunice all well in Farmington. one from Milton Holmeshe had been quite sick, lost $70 dollars, was very poor, had no decentclothes, could not go to England, hardest times he ever saw, could not geta dollar in money, but was gaining in health, was strong, in faith, urged meto remember him to Phebe &c. &c. I did not get a letter from Phebe but tookone out for Orson Pratt from his wife in Montrose I gave the letter to 
 parley for Orson & she said in her letter that Phebe & Sarah were gettingbetter, so Brother Pratt told me. You may be assured those words wereprecious to me, for I dreamed a few nights before that Sarah was dead but I thoughtthe dream might not be true, but come though multitude of business& though. I returned & took supper with Elder Pratt, he has got a good wife sheoften speaks of you, the whole family has had the fever & ague in the City buthave got well. I attended meeting at candlelight in Grand Street in theColumbian Hall which the Saints have higherd hired to hold their meeting in, itis in the most popular part of the city, rent $9 dollars per Day Parley gaveus a lecture upon the origins of the Indians & Book of Mormon. I hadthe happy privilege of taking Brothers Taylor & Turley once more by thehand & found them well, truly the mercy of God has been great untous all. B. Young & H. C. Kimble was in the state of N. Y. expet themin the city every day. After meeting Elder Taylor accompanied me to myboarding place in King Street & we retired to rest. Distance of the Day. 60 mThus ended the business of the 11th Day of Dec with me. Yesterday I calledupon Ilus at his Store 118 Bleacker Street corner of Woster I found himwell & in good spirits. he had recieved a letter from Father, Mother, Ezra,Shuah, & Sister Foss since I last saw him all well in Mainebut exceding hard times. Last evening I sat in conferenceat Elder P. P. Pratts house in Mott street 58. the conferenc was called inconference consequence of an improper course persued among the churches byElder Joseph Ball & Richards we did not get through last eveningbut meet for the same purpose this evening. The work of the Lord is stillprogressing in this country. Parley is labouring faithfully in this City bothin public speaking & printing. he has already out of the press 2,500of the voice of warning. 2,500 of the persecution of the Saints willsoon be out in bound volume, 2,500 of the Book of Mormon Iexpect will soon go to press & also he has other works in the press thework is not ownly progressing in this City. but a great work is openingin the City of Philadelphia 30 or 40 have been baptized mostly underthe laboursers of B. Winchester & hunders [hundreds] are believing Brother Winchesterwished me to call & labour awhile with him & I should have doneso If I had not been suddenly called to this City to have attended this conference. Elder O. Pratt has gone to hold a protracted meeting 30 milesfrom phila[delphia] with Elder Barns I was informed last evening thatthat had baptized about 40 during the meeting. & their are many calls forlabourers. &c. The Elders here all wish to be remembered to you & to theirfamilies as far as you have oppertunity to inform them Elder Turley iswriting a letter to his wife on the same table with me. Remember me 
 to all the Saints in Lovely Street, Montrose, & Commerce as far asthey inquire. Brothers Young, Kimble, Taylor, Turley, Hadlock, &c. went toKirtland & spent some time there & they say they would not like to havetheir family is there for they think it harder times than it is in the west to geta living. Perhaps our friends in the West may wonder at our tarrying onthis continant so long but the reason in short is the want of meansto pay our fare to England we have had much to struggle with. Weleft home without purs or scrip, & sick & feble but through the greatmercy of God we have all been able to reach New York but we allarived here nearly penny less but as I have been out into the country theLord has put into my hands means sufficient to pay my own fare, butI feel equally interested in the wellfare of my Brethren that they also may havemeans to go on my their way as well as myself. I know the enemy has struggledhard to prevent the Twelve from filling this mission. Will he finally prevailNo God forbid, we are determined to soon stand in England if we go theirthrough the greatest perils. Yes I say in the name of the God of Israel I willlift up my voice in England in preaching Jesus Christ & him crusifed & cry repent-anc to that people & that spedily to, for the spirit of God is like fire shut up i[n] [paper torn]my bones & rolling as with electricity though my spirit crying Haste Haste [paper torn]they know not what awaiteth them.

 [Deseret Weekly News, March 6, 1897, 366.]THE DESERET WEEKLY.[Column 1]PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S BIRTHDAY.BIOGRAPHICAL.On Sunday, February 28, 1897, at 2p. m., and on the following day, Mon-day, March 1, at 10 a.m., were exer-cises in the Tabernacle in honor of theninetieth anniversary of the birth ofElder Wilford Woodroff, President ofthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and one of the first com-pany of Utah Pioneers that enteredthe valley of the Great Salt Lake.For this occasion the Tabernaclehas been beautifully decorated.The speakers' stands are ornamentedin white and old gold, with numerousflowers and potted ferns and otherplants and around the organ. Thetable at the foot of the stands is coveredwith flowers, and in front of this seatsare raised above the floor for PresidentWoodruff and wife to occupy duringthe reception on Monday. Over thisis a canopy draped with the Stars andStripes, with electric lights in the topto throw light upon the couple. Thiscanopy will remain thrown back uponthe table until the time of the recep-tion. The upper stand, which will beoccupied by the President and hiswife during the rendering of the pro-gram, has been raised about sixteen inches higher than its usual posi-tion so that a full view can be had of them from every part of thebuilding. In front of and near the topof the organ is a beautiful star com-posed of sixty-one electric lights; overthis and extending from south tonorth across the building is a whitestreamer bearing the inscriptions"Glory be to God," "Honor to His Prophet," and the three dates, 1807,1847, 1897. Around the gallery boot-ing is stretched, with a star over eachpost, and at the rear of the building is the inscription, "We honor the manso honored of God." Above the rear of the gallery is a banner on which is painted 1847-1897. Below this is aUnion flag which passed through the war.Herewith is a brief sketch of Presi-dent Woodruff's long and eventful life,furnished by himself:I was born March 1, 1807, at Northing-ton, part of the Farmington (now Avon),Hartford county, Connecticut. Inmy early life I worked as a farmerand miller. Of course my childhoodwas passed under the influence of the remnants of the Blue Laws of Con-neticut. I remember the day well when the Baptists and the Methodistsin Connecticut were almost as un-popular as the Mormons afterwardsbecame. Presbyterians and Congre-gationalists were the ruling religionsof New England in my childhood.In attending Sunday school in myearly boyhood, under Dr. Noah Porter,and learning chapters of the Bibleby heart, I saw what Jesus Christ and the Apostles taught. Those principleswere so firmly imprinted on my mindthat I could never join any church,because the churches of that day didnot believe them, until I heard ZaraPulsipher, a Mormon Elder, preach tome and my brother Azmon, and a large congregation of neighbors, atRichland (now Dansville), Oswegocounty, New York, on the 30th day ofDecember, 1833. On hearing the firstsermon I and my brother Azmon wereconvinced, and we went forth and[Column 2]were baptized on the 31st of Decem-ber, 1833.I went in Zion's camp, in the springof 1835, to Missouri, to the assistanceof our people who had been drivenout of Jackson county. Very few ofthe members of that Camp are livingtoday. That thousand miles' journeywith the Prophet Joseph Smith was tome a school of experience that I shallnever forget in this world or the worldto come. When the Prophet returned toKirtland with most of his company Iremained in Clay county, Missouri,until the 13th of January, 1835, whenI left Lyman Wight's, in companywith Henry Brown, to go on a missionto the Southern states. We passedthrough Jackson county, Missouri, andthrough Arkansas, and from LittleRock to Memphis, Tennessee. I spenttwo years in Tennessee and Ken-tucky. While there I was ordained to theoffice of an Elder under the hands ofWarren Parrish, and afterwards amember of the Second quorum of theSeventy, under the hands of DavidW. Patten. I ordained A. O. Smoot tothe office of an Elder in 1836, and hetraveled with me through Kentuckyand Tennessee, and accompanied meto Kirtland in the fall of that year. Iorganizd four branches of the Churchin Tennessee and Kentucky.In 1837 I traveled through part ofCanada, New York, Massachusetts,Connecticut and Maine and FoxIslands. During that mission I bap-tized several hundred persons andorganized five branches of the Churchin Connecticut, Maine, and Fox Is-lands. In January, 1837, I was ap-pointed to the First quorum of Seven-ties.In 1838 I traveled on three islands ofthe sea and in twelve states of theUnion, established three preachingplaces and organized one branch ofthe Church in Farmington, Conn.,with nine of my relatives, includingmy father's house.On the 26th of April 1839, myselfand George A. Smith were ordainedto the Apostleship, on the Temple cor-ner at Far West, Missouri. The sameyear I crossed the Atlantic ocean incompany with John Taylor, to Eng-land, spending the next year there withthe Twelve Apostles. First I wentto Staffordshire and organized threebranches. Then I went to Hereford-shire, Worcestershire and Gloucester-shire, where, in eight months, Ibrought 1,800 souls into the Church,including 600 of the United Brethren,who had broken off from the Wes-leyan Methodists, with forty-fivepreachers, baptizing all of that sectbut one member. I established threeconferences and fifty-eight preachingplaces, and organized forty-sevenbranches of the Church.I then went to London with HeberC. Kimball and George A. Smith.We organized the first branch of theChurch in that city, consisting ofeighty-five members.In 1841, I traveled over 7,000 milesthrough England, Wales and parts ofthe United States, with the TwelveApostles, to attend to the affairs of theChurch.I spent most of 1842-3 in Nauvoo, at-tending to the printing office and otherbusiness. An important year was 1844,in which the Prophet Joseph Smith andhis brother Hyrum were killed. That[Column 3]year I traveled over 10,000 miles inCanada and the United States, visiting the churches, attending meetings,etc. In the fall of the year I was ap-pointed to go to England to pre-side over the British mission, settingsail at New York December 7th, andarriving at Liverpool January 4, 1845,during which year I traveled in Eng-land and Scotland, presiding over thechurches, published 3,000 copies of theDoctrine and Covenants, and securedthe copyright of the same in London.In 1846 I returned from England tothe United States, and gathered withthe Saints at Winter Quarters on theMissouri, where I spent the winter.On the 7th of April, 1847, Ileft my family and friends atWinter Quarters and traveledwith President Brigham Young andthe Pioneer company of 143 men, athousand miles across the plains intothe midst of the Rocky Mountains,arriving in the valley of the GreatSalt Lake on the 24th of July. Welaid out Great Salt Lake City and builta fort around ten acres. PresidentYoung and some others of us returnedto Winter Quarters the same season.In traveling across the plains, forthree days and nights, we met an al-most endless number of buffalo, goingto their summer ranges to break upinto smaller herds to feed in the Plattecountry. They were so numerous thatwe could scarcely |find| our way through them.In the spring of 1848 I took myfamily and returned to Boston, Mass.,spending the rest of the year and also1849 in traveling through the NewEngland states and part of Canada,gathering up most of the Saints re-maining there and sending them to theRocky Mountains.On the 9th of April, 1850, with myfamily and about a hundred otherSaints, I left Boston, and with steam-boats, railroads and wagons againtraveled to the Rocky Mountains,where I arrived on the 14th of October,having traveled 4,617 miles.From 1851 to 1877, twenty-six years,I spent mostly in Utah, traveling andpreaching considerably among theSaints, and also otherwise fulfillingthe duties of my calling as one of theTwelve Apostles.President Young died August 29,1877, John Taylor succeeding him asPresident of the Church.From 1877 to 1887, during the Presi-dency of John Taylor, I spent most ofmy time traveling, preaching in Utahand Arizona, and laboring in St.George temple for the salvation andexaltation of the living and the dead.When John Taylor was accepted asPresident of the church, October 10,1880, I became president of thecouncil of the Twelve Apostles.President Taylor died July 25, 1887,and it fell to my lot to succeed him inpresiding.I was accepted as the President ofthe Church April 7, 1889, with GeorgeQ. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith asmy counselors, since which time Ihave endeavored to attend to the du-ties of that office to the best of myknowledge and ability.I was appointed assistant historian ofthe Church in 1855, and historian in1881. Franklin D. Richards was sus-tained as my successor in that officeApril 7, 1889.

 Burslem Feb 3rd 1840Elder W. RichardsDear BrotherThough I have no extraordinary informationto communicate to you at this time upon any subject, yet I thought I woulddrop a few lines to you this morning, & let you know that I am alive &enjoying good health, & what I am about &c We arived in Manchester the day weleft you, & saw Elder Clayton & the Saints in good spirits. I was muchpleased with my acquaintance with Brother Clayton I consider him a worthyBrother a man of wisdom & of God. I was called upon in the evening with Brother Claytonto go & visit that Sister that has been so much afflicted possessed with the Devil &c. Ido not recollect the name. her husband that was considered under Transgression cameto us & confessed his Sins, & next day made acknowledgments before the church.When we arived at his house his wife was in a great rage required 3 men to hold herWe lade hands upon her & after a mighty struggle cast the devil out & rebukedthe fever & she was made whole & was at meeting comfortable next day, butthe devil entered into her child next, day & flung it into a dredful agony &made it as stiff as a stake, we lade hands upon it, & the devil instantly cameout & the child fell asleep. I have herd nothing from them of late. We preached withthem on Sunday & had a pleasant time with them. We left Manchester on the 21st & rode to Burslem, & found Elder Cordon & the Saints well. I foundthem meeting with some opposition in Burslem such as getting the candles& candlesticks flung at their heads while preaching. The rabble generally was leadby John James. We immediately commenced preaching & opening new doorsas we had an oppertunity. One evening while I was preaching in Burslem John Jamescame with two constables (to keep the peace for he feared the people) while he could read a pamphlet exposing Mormonism taking taken from Mormonism unveiled & W. Parrishletters & P. P. pratts &c. I helped him to read then what I could, by giving him lights, &water to quench his thirst, & calling for order while the house was hissing at himwhen he got though I answered him & the people retired in peace, his opposition 
 has injured him & given us friends. We have held regular meetings on theSabbath in Bath Burslem, & Hanely. We now have meetings in Burslem &Hanly, Stoke, Newcastle, Lane End, & a number of other places, round aboutI have been informed that the Rector in New Castle is preaching against usquite a number of Methodist teachers attend our meetings & freequently opposebut they go away confounded while it begets us friends. We have quite a goodroom in Hanly that we have lived for six months, which will be the sta[n]dingplace for the church to meet in on the Sabbath we have vary full & attentivecongregations how many will come out in this regeion I do not knowbut the work seams to be prosperous here as yet, their has been a numberbaptized since we came, the Church now Numbers between 70 & 870 &others given in their names. I became convinced it was the will of Godfor one of us to go to Birmingham & taking all things into considerationwe thought it best for Elder Turley to go. & consequently he left Burslemfor Birmingham on the 28th Jan & I suppose is now labouring in Birminghambut I have not herd from him since he Left. We are determined by theassistance of God to open a Door in Every town from the Potteries to Birmingham & erect a Standard in it. I feel as though it will be a dayof warning & not of many words to England. I think that what we do weshall do quickly. I would here also remark their are a number of Doorsopening in the towns between the Potteries & Manchester & preast SamuelHeath & Elder Clark I believe are labouring there. I am enjoying go[o]d health &spirits & the Saints generally are well, & wish to be remembered to you &wife Sister Elizabeth Revenscraft sends her respets to you & Sister Richards &says tell Brother Richards that Mother will not have any more preaching at herhouse. I wish you to Remember me to Sister Richards, & the familywhere you reside & to Sister's Fielding, & Dawson, & all who inquire. I supposeI have not had any letters as yet come to Preston. I wish you to drop afew lines to me after recieving this & inform me of your health & SisterRichards & about all the Saints & any information that you may have from ourfriends in Liverpool or elswhere. I saw a late account in the paper of the destruct-ion of the City of New Orleans in the U.S.A. by the Mississippi River I do not know 
 whether it be true or not. Please direct your Letter to Wilford Woodruff in careof Alfred Cordon, club buildings, Navigation Road, Burslem, Staffordshire.May health, Strength, peace, & grace, rest upon you from God ourFather, & our Lord Jesus Christ that you may be prepared to do the will ofGod in all thingsW.

BrotherKimbbal Kimball sick in Kirtland with chills & fever. LetterDated Dec 15th 1839 So much from Bro clarks letter. As to newswith us I have nothing very special to say ownly I am stiring thepeople up much in this country at the present time Hanly esspecially Ipreached thursday night in Hanly to about 400 people & a number of priestcame out armed with ^ivisible^ weapons to give me dreadful battle upon the Bookof Mormon the Lord showed it to me & I preached to them upon the Bookof Mormon & disarmed them of every weapon that they had chosen to fightme with & it flung them into confusion & they did not wish to leave without doing sumthing & so they jumped upon a Bench & raved & hollowed like madmen untill they were not ownly choaked up but pulled off from the Bench[by] by the people I gave answers to their hurrang [harangue] as long as I thought itwisdom & then left the house all in an uproar, I lig like to see 
 some excitement & things are working about right now in the potteriesto have the people hear the word whether they embrace it or not, the priestare quite mad because we are getting a hold in Hanly we havea good house to preach in & we have a worthy brother who has received the work & his doors are opened unto us constantly. he is a Merc-hant in the place his wife & servent are also members of the ChurchWe shall have warm opposition in Hanly for it is the seat ofiniquity & pristcraft but the Lord is with us. I preach on the morrow Sunday in Stoke & Lane End Elder Corden in Hanly. I receveda letter from Elder Turley on Thursday he was in Birminghampreaching to his relatives in the family circle. but was soon expectingto preach in public. he foud hard work to preach to his parents whohad been professors of Godliness 40 years & had great confidence intheir ministers. Brother H. Glover has just returned on a visit tohis friends about 50 miles & some rage & fight otherers want the word& some wish to be Baptzed. But I will close about matters withusNow Dear Brother with respect to your Difficulty that you spoke ofI will acknowledge I have not had time to meditate upon it & pray about itas much as I could wish but yet the spirit of God knows all things Iam sensible you have many difficulty things to encounter. I do notknow what better you could have done than the course you have persued considering all circumstances, but one thing is certain sumbody is muchout of the way. In the first place I ask in the name of reason & Revelationthat if Sister D is sick what business Sister C or any other person has to accuseher of feigning herself sick, the principle is of the Devil & the spirit of God bearsrecord against it. If Sister C had charity & the Love of God in her soul & wasin the way of her Duty she would go & sympathise with Sister D insteadof speaking against her & that to behind her back such things are agaistthe law of God & iniquity cannot be retained in the church of christ orat least it should not. The church did right in withdrawing the hand of fel-lowship from Sister C, & she ought not to be restored unless she will makean humble acknowledgement of her sins & repent of them before God. if othershad sined ever so much it is no place for Sister C to make a bulwark of 
 to shelter her sins behind. Again the principle of finding fault with aBrother & or Sister & speaking evil of them behind their backs as a sin thatGod hates & if it is not repented of it will bring the curse of God uponthe heads of those that are thus guilty. & I believe their is eviel of thiskind in Preston, & their are those in preston that have wrongly accused &had evil surmisings both towards you & Sister Richards & if they donot scease from those things & spedaly repent their wickedness shall bemanifest & their eniquity brought to light & they will feel the chastninghand of God, & I say it in the name of Jesus christ. I knowit is difficult to deal with such cases whare they are all pointed towards ones own self, but I am more & more convinced & that toby the spirit of God, that the church Will never prosper in preston untillthey treat you in a different manner from what they are doing at leastmany of them, they ought to sympathize with you in your afflicti[on]& assist you to the necessaries of life, & uphold you by love, confidencepray[er] & faith, it is what God requires at their hand. Brother & SisterRichards dont be discouraged, the Lord will give you the victory, youshall overcome & your Enemies shall not prevail against you, I will plead with God for you, you shall have my prayers if I cando nothing more. I would say in all cases of Church dealing itwould be well to persue the gospel course & it appears that you have done& leave the event in the hands of God. & let us ask God for wisdom &he will give it unto us. My Love to Sister Richards & all whoinquire a letter from you will meet a welcome reception atany time Dont trouble yourself about the postage it is but a trifle II will pay it. excuse the hasty scribling of this sheet. That health, strength,faith, grace, & evry needful thing may rest upon you from God ourFather & our Lord Jesus christ is the prayer of your Brother in the Love of GodW. Richards W Woodruff

 Leigh, Gloucestershire, England. Sept 12th, 1840.Elder H. C. Kimball & G. A. Smith.Beloved Brethern,I am in the midst of the saints at the Leigh enjoying good health & spirits. & while meditating upon the scenes which have transpired with me during the last 23 days which has been spent with you on a mission in the City of London, I feel disposed to pen a few of my thoughts on paper for your perusal. Brethren this is the first mission we have ever enjoyed together in the vineyard. Can we for a moment say that our time hath been spent in vain during this period? Nay we cannot the spirit within me forbids it. Have we not profited by this school of experianc? yea much evry way. While the Lord hath manifested by revelation that it is his will that we should obtain a knowledge of Kindgdoms & countries, this mission hath placed us in a situation to avail our- selves of the desired information upon many things that which we could not otherwisehave obtained. Time will clearly show that the late mission which we have enjoyed togetherin the City of London (which is still continued by your labours) will ever be firmly engraved in our minds & occupy an important place, In the history of our travels among the Nations of the Earth. When London feels the chastning hand of the ALMIGHTY & in her turn amid the revolutions of the gentile world finds her doom is sealed with herlofty spires, synagogues, mansion, & pallaces, laid in one common ruin, then with what feelingsshall we address our children or the thousands that may surround us, while our headsare blossoming with age, as we point to the 21st day of September ^october Aug^ 1840, when we stood together upon the top of the most splended & highest modern pillar in the Univers &with the naked eye surveyed the most populous & wealthy city upon the face of the earth, which we can then exclaim hath been the theater of much misry & wo, but now sleepsin death. We ^having in my possessin a history of places visited I feel disposed to give the same {that [and may he] give} a correct {account of} the {same} to refer to^ shall not readily forget ^on the 24th oct we visited^ Oct [Aug] 24th while we walked to & fro through StPauls Cathedral which was 500 feet in length 285 in bredth 404 in highth which was 40 yearsin building from 1675 to 1715 which cost £136000 or $3,680,000 ^£l,567,076,15. $ 5880,380^ which contains 47 monuments of fine marble erected over the Tombs of certain Lords Bishops Generals Earls & other titles who had distinguished themselves in the military service of Great Brit-ian & otherwise, Lord Nelsons being the most noted, & while historians have taken much interest in the origen of this cathedral dedicated St Paul which was first built by StAugustine in the year 610, & now considered the largest cathedral in the world excepting the Vatian at Rome dedicated to St Peter. We ^ourselves^ can clearly see the gentiles are zealous in a form of Godliness while they deny the power thereof, for while this church stands in honor to St Paul, those who whorship therein utterly reject & deny the principles which he tought. Again I think we shall not doubt the words of Soloman when he said man had sought ought many inventions esspecially when we reflect back to the 1st day of Sept, when We desended together about 40 feet into the Bowels of the earth & walked throught the ThamesTunnel with the River Thames & British shiping over our heads which was opening a thorough fare from one shore to the other which was finished 1110 ^feet^ & was lighted with gas, arched overhead & considered one of the greatest wonders of the last days. The time we spent together on the 5th of Sept Visiting Westminster Abbey was not unprofitable, had we travled the world oer we could not have found another spot that would have pre-sented a wider field of knowledge & of contemplation as touching the history of the rise, progress, & fall of Kings, Princes Lords & mighty men of Gentile greatness pride & boast. This Abbey was composed of eleven Chapels (ownly seperated by walls or petitions) 
 Viz 1. St. Benedict. 2. St. Edmund. 3. St. Nicholas. 4. Henry the Seventh. 5. St. Paul.6. St. Edward the Confessor. 7. St. Erasmus. 8. Abbot Islip. 9. St. John. 10. St Andrew& 11. St. Michael. & these Chapels contain the Bodies, tombs, & monuments, of of elveven Twelve ^13^Kings viz Edward I. — III. — V — VI. Charles. II. Henry III. — V. — VII. James I. George II.Richard II. & William III. & Sebert King of the east Saxons who first built this church & died July 616 Also Twelve ^13^ Queens viz Athelgoda, Queen of Sebert who Died Sept 13 615& Phillippa, Matilda. Mary I. — II. & Queen Mary of Scotland, Elizabeth, Catherine, & Queen Anne & Editha, Eleanor & Caroline & of ^six^ Prince's George, & Eleven ^11^ Dukes, seven ^7^—Duchess, one ^1^ Marquis, Seven ^7^ Lords, three ^3^ Vicount, Eight ^8^ Countess, three ^3^ Barrons sixteen ^16^— Earls, eleven ^11^ Admirals, twelve ^ten 10^ Generals, 5 Col, ^3 Majors^ 10 Capt. 4 Lieut. 16 Bishops. 6 Divines15 Doctors, 52 Sirs. 153 Gentleman, & 48 Ladys, making 421 persons who have been deposited in vaults in this Abbey & Monuments erected to their memory. Here we had the privilegeof viewing the full stature & perfect likeness of Queen Elizabeth, Mary, & Anne Lord Nelson, & Pitt & others. We saw the full Coronation Dress of Queen Anne. We also saw the chair & sat in it, in which Queen Victoria was crowned & all the Kings & Queens in England for the last 800 years this chair is covered with gold tissue. It contains a stone under the seat upon which all the Scottish Chiefs, & Kings were crowned since they were a people it is reported to be Jacobs Pillar which chair has been in use 800years. In walking through this Abbey we see frequent marks of violence from Oliver Cromwellin defacing some of the tombs, monuments, & brass work with which some of the Abbey was adorned. Here we behold the art of man with all its combined force & power spun to the finest thread, & expanded to the fullest extent in the building & finishing of this Abbey as a general whole, But more esspecially that part called Henry Sephenth Seventh's Chapel& a visit to this Abbey is not ownly worthy of the Attention of all travellers but to occupy a place in the Journal of any Historian.While speaking upon this subject I would not pass over our visit to the house of Parliment, on the 8th of Sept. As we entered the house of Lords (now occupied as the house of Commons) ^we did not behold^ so much to interest the sight of the eye as the meditation of the mind, however we had the privilege of resting ourselves by siting in the chair in which the speaker of the house of Lords had sat for many years. In this room all the speeches were made by Mr William Pitt while advocating the American cause, before the Revolution. In this roomall the laws were made that now governs ^from^ 175 to 200 000 000 of human beings. As the house of commons was burned down about six years since this room at the present time is occupied by ^for^ the house of commons & there is another house now built which the house of Lords at the present time occupies. One would naturly suppose that a house of Parliament fitted up to contained Kings, Lords, & Commons would be sumthing extra, grand, & expensive but we found it quite the reverse. It is excedingly plain & undecorated. On entering the room one would sooner think he was in an American school house rather than in a house of Lords or of Commons.While retiring from this scenery we had a view of the order of British soldiery or foot guardswhile on parade in St James' Park, accompanied by a full band of music. Also of the Queens Horse guard 100 in number well mounted upon fat gay black mares, & the steel with which their bodies were covered glistening in the Sun. We might make mention of the monumenterected in honour to his grace the Duke of York which was 135 feet in highth & of the mansion of Queen Dowager widow of the Late King Williams IV which we had a view of as we past along. In fine St James Park is surrounded as it were with Dwellingsmansions, castles, monuments, & Palaces, of the first class as to size, splendour, & Note of any in Europe, of which Buckingham Palace is the Chief. this is for the Royal Family & is now 
 occupied by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, & his Highness Prince Albert, except while theyare at Winser Castle. Buckingham Palace Covers a number of acres of ground & is surrounded by a high wall of hewn stone except the front which is a high fence of cast Ironrailing, & evry door, enterence, & gate was strongly guarded by armed soldiers. I walked nearly around this castle Palace, & while there I for the first time had a view of his Royal Highness Prince Albert while he was riding from his palace across St James Parkmounted upon a gray horse accompanied ownly by his groom who was riding a sorrel horse.I also spent a few moments in the National gallery which was ^is^ not unprofitable to a travellerdesiring to form a knowledge of countries & the art of man. This gallery contains a vary great & extensive variety of the most Perfect Paintings that could be gathered together by the Nation, these with other things we have had the privilege of forming a knowledge of for ourselves. ^But^ Brethren while you discover that I hav written rather largely concerning these temporal & perishable objects which are in the same state, & doomed to share the same fate in the revolutions of the last days & the fall of Babylon, as Jerrusalemdid when they rejected their king & put to death the Messiah, think not that I for a momentharbour the idea that the ownly benefit we have derived in the enjoyment of our late mission together in the City of London has been a knowledge of these things, far from this.for while I have spoken of these things while they were in memory more for the purposeof preserving a historical sketch of the same than other wise, still the remaining part of the subject rest upon my mind with greater weaight. Yes Brethren our late mission together has not ownly put us in possession of a knowledge of those things spoken of but it hath given us a more intimate acquaintance with each other & that to in some degree in the midstof trials, which acquaintance has had a tendancy if possible to unite our heartsmore closer together in the love of God & the New & Everlasting Covenant. this is not all. we have stood together in this first mission to the city of London in which we have had the privilege of uniting our labours in lifting up the standard of truth, of light, & the fulness of the everlasting gospel, & When on dilligent search we found the whole city given to Idolitry, Priescraft, tradition, superstition, & all manner of abominations wick-edness, & uncleanness & all doors closed against us we did not hesitate to stand in the midst of the streets & Jonah like cry repentance unto the Inhabitants of that mighty city, The Metropolis of England, the Pride & glory of Britain, the Boast of the Gentiles & thelargest city in the world, containing one million five hundred thousand souls who were ripened in iniquity, &prepared for the wrath of God, & like the ox going to the slaughter know not the day of their visitation. Yes Brethren I shall long remember standing in the midst of that people & assisting you in bearing a message unto them, a message— 
 which will prove a savior of life unto life or of Death unto Death not ownly unto them, but unto all they unto whom the sound thereof shall come, even of the whole gentile world & the judgment of the great day shall manifest the truth of it unto all nations. And it will ever sweeten the memory of that eventful period of my life to know that our labours on that occasion were not in vain. But that we were enabled through the great mercy & goodness of God & toil, labour, dilligent search, & perseverance, to find some of the Blood of Ephraim, a few honest souls that were willing to recieve & obey the gospel & that we were enabled to lay the foundation of a work in that City which will not be removed untill the City is warned so that they will be left without excuse, & the saints gathered out to stand in Holy places while judgment works. Untill that time the seed which we have sown in that city & that which you are now sowing shall bring forth fruit & the fruit shall remain to the honour & glory of God & I say it in the name of Jesus Christ & the Spirit Beareth record & the record is true. Therefore Brethren let your souls rejoice, & your hearts be made glad, that we are permitted to bear some humble part in the sacrafices, sufferings, & reproach of Christ & of warning this generation & of gathering together the honest in heart & the meekof the Earth that they with us may stand together in Holy places while judgement works ^works^, & be prepared to enter into that rest which remaineth for the People of God. And Dear Brethren my prayer to God is that we may ever be meek & humble that the Power of the Priesthood & the spirit of our ministry & mission may rest upon us that we may be carried through evry strait Place wherein we are called to walk thatwe may keep the faith & overcome the world. I pray my heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ that this may be our happy lot & that we, with all the Elders of Israel, & Saintsof God may be prepared to joyfully meet our Lord & Master when he appeareth again the second time without sin unto salvation.Thus Testifieth your Brother in the Everlasting CovenantWillford WoodruffCopy of a letter from W Woodruff to HC Kimball & G.

Zion shall be redeemed in mine own due time time, and if any man shall seek to build up himself and seeketh not my council he shall have no power, and his folley shall be made manifes[t]seek ye and keep all your pledges one with another and covet not that which is thy brothers. Keep yourselves from evi[l] to take ^not^ the name of thy God in vane; for I am the Lord your God, even the God of your Fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. I am he who led the children of Israel out of the Land of Egypt and my arm is streched out in the last days to save my people Israel cease to contend one with another. Cease to speak evil one of another. Cease drunkenness, and let your words tend to edeyfing one another. If thou borrowest of thy neighbor, thou shalt restore that which thou hast borrowed, and if thou canst not repay, then go straitway, and tell thy neighbor lest he condemn thee. If thou shalt find that which thy neighbor has lost, thou shalt make diligent search, till thou shalt deliver it to him again. Thou shall be diligent in preserving what thou hast, that thou mayest be a wise steward; for it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art his stewardIf thou art merry, praise the Lord, with singing, with music, with dancing and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving. If thou art sorrowful call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful. Fear not thine enemies for they are in mine hands and I will do my pleasure with them. My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to recieve the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion.And he that will not bear chastizment, is not worthy of my Kingdom; Let him that is ignorant, learn wisdom by humbling himself, and calling upon the Lord his God, that his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his ears opened that he may hear, for my spirit is sent forth into the wor[ld] to enlighten the humble and contrite, and to the condemnationof the ungodly.Thy brethren have rejected you andyour testimony, even the Nation that has driven you out; and now cometh the day of their calamity, even the days of sorrow like a woman that is taken in travel; and their sorrow shall be great, unless they spedily repent! ^yea vary spedily^ for they killed the prophets, and they that were sent unto them, and they have shed innocent blood, which crieth from 
 the ground against them; Therefore marvel not at these things, for ye are not yet pure: thou canst not yet bear my glory, But thou shalt behold it, if ye are faithful in keeping all my words that I have given you from the days of Abraham Adam to Abraham; from Abraham to Moses, from Moses to Jesus and the Apostles and from Jesus and his Apostles to Joseph Smith, whom I did call upon by mine Angels, my ministering servants and by mine own voice out of the Heavens, to bring forthmy work; which foundation he did lay, and was faithful and I took him to myself. Many have marvelled becaus of his death, but it was needful that He should seal his tes-timony with his blood, that he might be honored and the wicked might be condemned.Have I not deliverd you from your enemies, ownly in that I have left a witness of my name? Now, therefore, harken, O ye people of my church; and ye Elders, listen togetheryou have received my kingdom, be diligent in keeping all my commandments, lest judgment come upon you, and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over you.So no more at present Amen and Amen.January 22, 1847 ~ Friday22ndd Friday I met in council with the TwelveJanuary 23, 1847 ~ Saturday223rd I spent the day at home But attended the council of the seventies in the evening with the Twelve & the quorum of the Twelve with President Young at the Headset for going forth in the dance the persons that took the floor to set the pattern were as follows Brigham Young Heber C.

In the evening I met with the quorum of the Twelve & others to learn to take theproper steps in dancingFebruary 16, 1847 ~ Tuesday16th I have a vary severe cold & horseness this was one of the most interesting days of my life I attended the familymeeting of President Brigham Young and he addressed the meeting at great length during the day and evening upon many interesting principles. There were present of the quorum of the Twelve B Young H. C. Kimball O. Pratt W. Richards W. Woodruff G. A. Smith A Lyman & E. T. Benson. After singing and prayer by President Young he arose to address the meeting & remarked that he had invited the Twelve to be present though they were not of his family. yet I wish them to act free and speak such things as the Lord shall give them.Let me state a principle by which you may contemplatemuch. For the want of understanding many have sufferedjealeousies to arise which afflicted theire minds with [borrowed] troubles and uneasiness fearing the Lord loved some others more than themselves, this I have sinceeen in the churchever since its rise. it was manifest in Kirtland when the first Bishop was ordained this jealeous feeling was manifestsome wondered if the Lord would think enough of them to ordain them a Bishop Father Morley and others that werepresent can bare record of this fact. And when the Twelvewere chosen the same feelings exhisted & in fact I will not except all of them for some of them manifested the samefeelings when the Bishops were ordained. this spirit has been the overthrow of many in this church and in fact upon this principle thousands have fallen in all ages. The Lord gives to everry man all the power influence and authority that he can wield in righteousness and all that his goodnes[s]& faithfulness merits then why should jealousies arise orwhat benefit can arise by suffering such feelings to exhistnone at all, but those that cherish such feelings commencetrying to pull down every one that is prospering or gaining influence as Cain did instead of building up & nourishing every promising tree & thereby prove himself worthy & show to his brethren & to God that he loves the cause & by hispassive spirit that he is not ownly willing that others should should prosper & gain influence & that he actually loves to see them prosper for then he does all that he can through hims[e]-lf, he helps advance it through others although they recievethe honor of it and he still be aware of it such a man willnever be forgotten and to his honor glory and exhaltation there shall be no end.There is another principle that has caused considerable uneasiness and trouble. ie the Idea of some mens having more wives than one, such tremendious fears take hold of some that they hardly know how to live still they cant die, begin to 
 whisper and talk around am actually afraid to go on a mission for fear some man will be sealed to my wife, & when they return home some will be babbing about, you dont know but what you have got another mans wife, are afraid to speak to a young woman for fear that she belongs to somebody els or for fear somebody els wants her. (others deny the faith as they think but theynever had much) and say that it is all of the devil &c such foolish-nish ought not to be cherished among a wise & prudent people. Admitting the Lord created the same number of women as men at the beginingand were commanded to multiply & replenish the earth & to fill up the measure of there creation in righteousness; the question isdid they do it answer No, they soon disobeyed every commandme-nt & plunged themselves into wickedness and rendered themselvesunworthy to raise up seed unto the Lord & in fact used every meansin there power to cut of[f] life & hinder woman answering the end forwhich they were created; nine tenth of them would rebel against the vary thing he was created to do. Hence you see the propriety of theLord's calling upon men who bears the priesthood to take to themselves wives from among the daughters of men & raise up a righteous seed untohim that he might fill up the measure of there creation and hasten the consumation of his purposes in righteousness in this dispensationaccording to his words previously spoken through his servents the prophets. But those who suffer fears & jealouses to aris in there bosoms either back right out or get to be mighty righteous & for fear that they are sleeping with other mens wife—they kick up a dust orbroil at home & perhaps abuse there own companion through jealousy then go off to some woman that does not understand what is rightor wrong & tell her that he has she cannot be saved without a man and he has almighty power & can exhalt & save her & likely tell that there is no harm for them to sleep together before they are sealed then go to some doe head of an Elder & get him to say the ceremony, alldone without the knowledge of the authority of this Church. this is not right, & will not be suffered. The God I serve will reward every ^man^ openly without his being under the necessity of going secretly& privately palming himself on the credulity of innocent ignorant females. Such jealeousies do exhist & were I to say to the Elders you now have the liberty to build up your kingdoms one half of them would lie, swear, steal, & fight like the vary devil, to get men & women sealed to them they would even try to pass right by me & go to Joseph thinking to get between him & the Twelvesome have already tryed to used an influence against me. but suchjealeousies & selfishness shall be stoped & if the brethren do not stop it I will blow it to the four winds by making them all come & be sealed to me & I to my Father & he and all this church to Joseph. when I go asstray & give wrong council & lead this peopleastray, then is time enough to pull me down & then God will remove me as he has done all others who has turned fromthe faith. But to return, I have gatherd a number of families around me by the law of adoption & seal of the covenant according to the order of adoption the priesthood and others have done likewise it being the means of salvation left to bring us back to God. but had the keys of the priesthood been retained & handed down from father to son throughout all generationsup to the present time then there would have been no nece[ssity] of the law of adoption for we would have all been includedin the covenant without it & would have been legal heirs

 January 9, 1849 ~ Tuesday9th [FIGURE] I recieved 3 Letters from O. Spencer Dan Jones & W. I.Appleby And one from Robert Windley All contained good newscapt Dan Jones expresses his feelings in warm terms concerning myletters to him And says he feels incouraged to go ahead in the name of the Lord says he has raised up a Branch at Myrtha the Mother Branch of Britain, over 800 members. And the sum total He had raised up in that country was represented at the general conference of Manchester England Aug 14th 1848 amounting to 2747 member. The whole representation at this general conference of England Scotland & Wales was 17902 members 350branches, 929 Elders 1185 Priest, 608 Teachers 341 Deacons Added since May 31, 1846, 8467. Elder Orson Pratt is now President of the Churches in the British Isles and herd the Above reppesentation. Elder Jones Adds I have published in the welch language 48 different kinds And size of pamphlets comprising moreoriginal matter than the Book of Mormon Doctrins & Covenants & voice of warning, And have circulated one million eighthundred thousand of Pages all of which preach night And Day to rich & poor the eternal truths of Mormonism And cheer the Honest Harted, many learned And some very noted men have Embraced the work. I have been Enabled to subdue myfoes many of the gifts of the spirit are manifest. one young man who had been Deef & Dumb 8 years was healed when coming up out of the waters of Baptism so he both herd And spake was ordained to the Priesthood And is now pre-aching the gospel with success. Capt Jones is Adding 150 per monthElder Spencer writes many good things his is much better says the work is rolling forth in much Power I have been of late stiring up the saints to pay their tithing I have visited manyof the conferences for this purpose I feel incouraged to BelieveI shall gather a good sum for the Temple. their Are 4 persons Expecting to come in possession of large sums of money before I go to America from them I expect to get several thousand pounds As tithing to gladden the hearts of the saints in the valley. the Addition to the Churches continue to be great the Emigration falls much short of the increase. their may be 1500 saints Emigrate this season butwhat is that among so many. O. Pratt thinks it would take 300 ships to carry the British saints at the present time, the hopesof the wicked Are perishing while looking for better times And ind-ividuals And Nations both feel like grasping all they can get hold of Either by fair or foul means. The Papel Crown has At length fallen. It looks As though the Beastly power of Mobocracy spoken of in Revelations was likely to destroy the dominion of the Motherof Abominations spedily. The Emperor of Austria has Adbdicated and the King of Prussia has called A constitutional government but the Saints wax vary bold And utter their testimony with As much assurance in the Holy Ghost. it is truly delightful tosee them pushing sectarian churches And Demolishing human creeds as so much hay & stubble, the weak are becoming strongand the Gentiles marvel.

I was vary sick at night with teeth ake cold and ague in the face did not sleep at all, during the nightso I had a plenty of time for meditation and among the subjects before me I reflected upon a Mission that one of the Presidents of the Seventies presented to the Eastern Branches whileon his mission East to collect funds for building a SeventiesHall in the valley, why was the mission not signed by Pres-ident Brigham Young if it was right for such a mission to be taken, or was it got up to assist the individual inperson more than to build the Seventies Hall, I think itright and safe to present all missions and business of importance before the President of the Church, when they can be got at 20 milesJanuary 21, 1849 ~ Sunday21st Sunday I was still sick through the day my face dbadly swollen yet I spoke 1 1/2 hours to a small company of the Saints and spent the night with some English Brethren, but itwas another severe night of paine and affliction I did not sleep at all.

He Also read me the printed correspondancebetween him And Elder O Hyde comprising their difficulties And After Hearing all of his subjects through Embracinghis whole course Expectation of office in the general surveyor-ship of that country, & in the Territorial & State Government &c &c I come to the following conclusion in my meditationsthat He was at work upon his own hook that he was not counciled by the Presidency of the Church to Engage in thisGovernment matter, And considering the course the Govern-ment had taken towards us As A People I felt no dispositionas An individual to Petition them for Any thing, But let them take whatever course they felt disposed And trust ourselvesAnd Affairs in the Hands of the God of Israel. yet whatevercourse the combined council & wisdom of the Church thought properto persue in that channel I would throw my labour And influenceBut As their is danger of mens trying to perform more then they are sendt to do, And whareas I was sent to Preside over the Eastern churches Preach the gospel to them & gather out as many of them As I could to Zion, Therefore Resolved that my Presentstate of Health, Duty, calling, inclination And the spirit within mewill not permit me to leave the business I was sent to do And go toWashington to form An acpuaintance & gain influence with wicked& corrupt men to lay A plan to assist in governing the Saints in theValley for with the grace of God I believe they are Able to govern themselvesYet when called upon to go to Washington By the Presidency Im on hand

I closed by making An address concern[ing] Zion in the following words[rest of page blank] 
 I cannot close my record upon the signs of the times witof 1848without turning my eye towards Zion, yes Zion, which is not now merely a phantom of the brain or a name, but actually a living thing. Truly she is yet but a babe just born. Yet she hasA Tabernacle, the Mountains of Israel. Her bed is in the cham-bers of the rocks. Her garden one of the rich valleys of Ephraim She speaks and Her voice is as the voice of God. She has A spirit which burns like flames of fire. She has power, And has started A little stone rolling from the mountain her habitation, which increases as it goes: it is causing the Earth to quake & tremble, take care ye Nations it will grind you to dust. She has messengerswho go & come at her bidding, one of them can chase A thousand and two put ten thousand to flight, they command the Element& they obey them. She has An Ensign for the Nations to fleeto. She has A law which will soon govern the Earth. She is born in the generation that David had A view of. O Praise the LORD I am a witness that mine eyes have beheld her. She has Keys to open & no man can shut, And shut And no man can open. Her power is from Heaven whare she hath Noble senators who plead her cause both day & night. This is theZion I seek After, this is the Zion I speak off. Her Churchis the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Her city was sought in 1847 And the Lord has favored her from that that time. And During the year 1848 the Church has beenorganized with A first Presidency of three persons viz Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball & Willard Richards, who have gatherd to the mountains of Israel, in the valley of the Great Salt lake, Great Basin North America, And taken with them some three thousand souls with their flocks & Herds, which makes A population of about seven thousand souls in the city of the Great Salt Lake. The Lord has also blest their land which has brought forth in abundance. And while the Lord has been multiplying blessing upon Zion in her quiete HabitationHer messengers have been crying aloud to the Nations of the Earth & the Isles of the sea preaching the gospel unto themAnd uttering their testimony in the power of God And the gift of the Holy Ghost untill they have gatherd their thousands together untill one of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb (Orson Pratt) Estimates that it will take three hundred ships to removethe saints from the British Isles Alone to Zion. The Saints who were gather into the valley of the Sacramento have discoverd such vast mines of gold silver copper & other precious ores thatthe report of it is creating great excitement throughout the world Esspecially in the United States untill tens of thousands are rushing tothe gold regions to try to obtain the precious mettal. And as the handof God has been so visible in all the signs of 1848 May He continue his work through 1849 and all following years untill His arm shall be made bare in the eyes of all Nations. Untill Zion shall arive to her full strength of Manhood for Brass may she have gold for Iron silver for wood Brass for stones Iron. May her execters & peace officers be righteous men. May her Nobles be of EphraimAnd her Govournor procede out of the midst of Him. May all of her Messengers be armedwith righteousness in the power of God in great glory. May all of the Nations of the Earthfear & tremble because of her law. May the wicked find her sons terrible when they go tobattle against her & not have power to stand before them. May her dwelling places be distinguished by a pillar of fire by night & cloud by day, & in fine may she arise & shine forth And spread herself abroad with all that perfection of beauty power & glory which has ever been spoken concerning her Even to the full Expectation of God Angels & man Wilford Woodruff

I spoke of my birth day, gave him all the News I had from the valley, my interview with Br Whipple, with BrBabbitt made An extract concerning him And the Government from my Journals. Also made An extract from my address to the Histori[an]concerning Zion &c &c. The following is an Extract of my letterto him [FIGURES]Cambridgeport March 1st 1849 Elder Pratt, Beloved Brother, As this is my birth day Also the first day of Spring, my mind is led this morning more than usualto reflect upon the signs of the times of the Globe upon which we dwellAnd while meditating upon Zion And Her messengers my mind flitsacross the Ocean & runs over the wall And takes A view of A large co-mpany of swift messengers who are the Horns of Joseph used to pushthe people together from the ends of the Earth, these meditationscreate A desire to convers A few moments with Br Pratt. So while all Natureis locked fast in sleep before the dawn of day is broke to start man fromhis slumber I seat myself to say A few words to you. I said this was mybirth day, yes I am 42 years old this day. How such figures look toa man while counting up his years in this probation. The vary sightof them croud into the mind A flood of thought even more thantongue can utter or pen can write. The last sixteen years ofmy life has been spent in endeavouring to preach the Gospel & build up the Kingdom of God in connexion with my brethren. The pastis gone, I have no desire to recal it, I would would not wish to livemy life over if I could. I feel like looking forward & not backwardI have a great desire that I may spend my future days doing the worksof righteousness, Honoring the Priesthood & my calling, saving thesouls of men, & building up the Kingdom of God that I may have a place with the faithful at the end of the race. Turn my eyes whichway I will Either towards Babylon or Zion And I find the mov-ements & signs of Either of them at the present day Are fully keep-ing pace with the wheels of time. It is deeply interesting to seehear, feel, & live in this age and gaze upon the scenery of the whole Earth rushing like A Mighty cataract to finish its workwhile the high minded Jew in the highth of his pride was exha-usting his talents & oratory to prove to the Roman and the world their right to independance greatness & power. The Son of Godwas in Lamb like meekness bowing to the ordinance of BaptismAnd all the rites of the gospel & commandments of his Fatherlooking forward to the day when He should make his second visitto his brethren with his reward upon his head. So at the presentday while the Emperors, Kings, Princes, Lords, Nobles, PresidentsGovernours, Statesman with all the great men of Babylonhave been making A desperate Effort to maintain theirdignity And appear to a good Advantage before the whole Earth 
 many of the most Noble spirits that ever dwelt in flesh like Jesus and the Apostles have been meekly submitting to the ordimances of the gospel, and like little children have been subject to the Authority of the Holy Priesthood And have made evry sacrafize required and laboured day & night tobuild up Zion that the honest in Heart & the meek of the Earthmay have A place to flee to in order to Escape the just judgmentof ^that^ God whose rod is now suspendend in the Heavens and is about to Fall upon the Earth and lay great Babylon with all of Her greatness, pomp, power, and glory in the dust. My Prayer to God is that evry Elder of Israel & saint of God throughout the whole Earth may be incouraged to labour dilligently & faithfully while the day of Harvests lasts for soon night will come when No man can work, theyn ^they^ will be Just as sure of their rewardAs was their chief captain & Head.March 3, 1849 ~ Saturday3rd [FIGURES] I wrote A letter to Mr Wm B. Goodyear Anapolis Md. I Also recieved A letter from Wesley Siddle. Br Whipple called upon me And spent the Afternoon I had A good time with him we conversedupon A variety of subjects Among other things He informed me that the Utah Lake abounded with the largest kind of the Mountaintrout some As much as two & three feet in length And that allthe small & large streams puting out of the Mountains Also Abounded with trout. I went with Br Whipple into Bostonon my return I Assisted in the Baptizing of two individualsin the sea in the midst of the Ice. Br Bird Administered the ordi-nance in 3 feet of water they were the first He Baptized yet it[FIGURE] was well done.March 4, 1849 ~ Sunday[FIGURE] 4th Sunday The United States is without A President to day President Polk went out last night PresidentTaylor is installed to morrow. Hence there is no president to dayI met A congregation of saints And many strangers at Brother Birds for A meeting At 2 oclok Elder Whipple from the Valley of the Salt Lake was present. Elder J P Haven from the BluffsAlso And A vary full House. I Addressed over one hour & hadmuch of the Spirit of God resting upon me And bore A strong testimony unto the People preached the first principles of thegosple And spoke of the general Bareings of the work of God in the present Dispensation. In speaking of the body of ChristAnd members in particular I told them I had seen men in my travels without Arms, legs, some without eyes, &c but I had never seen A man going about without A head. And As A natu-ral body without A head would dye so the Church without ^a^ Head would die.Br Whipple followed me & made some vary good remarks And edeyfying He said notwithstanding the Jews had Apostitizedthe right of the kingdom belonged to them & Jesus came & set up the kingdom among them they rejected it He took the kingdom from the Jews gave it to the Gentile all that were in the kingdom went to the gentiles with the Kingdom of God. The Gentiles in like manner have Apostitized And havenot continued in the goodness of God still they have A rightt to have the kingdom of God set up among them in the last days And Joseph Smith being warned & commanded of God has recieved the gospel from the hand of an Angel, preached it to the gentiles set up the kingdom for the last timeamong them they have rejected it, it will now again be taken from them & given to the Jews & all in the kingdom will go to the Jews with it & many will come from E. W. N. S. & sidt down with A[b]ram &c while the ^gentiles^ children of the Kingdom will be cast out 
 Brother Haven followed with interesting remarks in explaining the principles of repentance, by A figure. If A Mother set two little children at work, they should leave it & go to play & dirty theirclothes And when the Mother came [she] find they had not done thework but been disobediant but promised forgiveness if they wo[uld] go wash their face change their closes [clothes] & do the work one goes & do as she is required the other follows her Mother & crys all day & pleads with her to forgive her. When night comes one has cryedall day for fiorgiveness, but has not done the thing required the other has done the things required, which is most justifyed the one that obeyed the Mother. So with Man it is not evry one [who]says Lord, Lord, that shall enter into my Kingdom but He that doeth the will of my father who is in Heaven.I Administered the sacrament And confirmed two persons And Blessed three children, And dismissed the meeting we had A good timeMarch 5, 1849 ~ Monday5th President Taylor takes his seat to day I sent 13 school Boo[ks] [FIGURE] By Br Haven to President Young & council for their exhami[n]ation.

There has been more written in the New York Herrald, Tribune, Sun, Boston papers & many papers in the United States in favor of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints than has been written before for many years. The Editors of papers begin to see that the saints will prosper, rise up & buildZion, nowithstanding all there Efforts to crush us & destroy usfrom off the Earth & when they now find us organizedinto a State Government holding in our hands the Key ofthe North American continant And that we will not diebut live & rise up in the midst of all our oppressions they begin to speak in our favor & the world marvel at our prosperity And One remarkable fact is that thousands of men who hadA hand in expelling us from the United States & drove us intothe wilderness have this season while on there way to the gold digings have had to come bending unto the saints & have had to look to them to save them from starvation & death

 The following speech was deliverd by Mr Copway or Kah-ge-ga-gah-Bow the Chief of the Ojewa Nation before a large audience in New York City On the eve of Dec 15 1849Ladies, Gentlemen, American Citizens. Of necessity my address this evening must be short. Yet I will touch upon a few prominent items which I consider important to the subject in which I feel deeply interested There are certain events which stand forth in bold relief of deep interest in the history of evry nation under heaven. Therefore theHistory of the Indians or there present condition has also a deep interest an interest of greater importance than at first presents itself to the mindof the American People Although it may appear to them as coverd with A cloud or buried deep from their view yet it none the less exhists.Then listen to me. I have deeply studied the situation & interest of my brethren the Red men for years and I have resolved to call aloud upon the white men of this Nation to give ear to my Petitons. If you do not seethe Indian Orator in your midst making a displey of oratory like the white man it is not because he has not talent but because he has nota chance to exercise it1th My object in visiting the United States is to present A petition to this Government that they may assist me in concentrating the Indians together that they may live & not die I want Congress to grant them a portion of Territory that they can call their own and be concentratedupon it that they not be driven from it any more. They once were the owners & occupiers of the whole soil of all North America. The whiteman came & removed the Indians and continually driven them untill they can see no hope but the grave before them. I now ask in theirbehalf a Territory to settle them upon that they may have a permanent home forever And come under the United States Government let them have some form of Government & become part and parcel of the United States. In this matter I have studied theinterest of all both the white & red men1st Give them a Territory that they can call their own where the children can point to the graves of their fathers & say we can now live in Peace and be driven no more. We can visit the graves of our fathers with none to drive us from them and they will be inspired to engage in evry laudable undertaking that now marks the course ofthe white man2nd You can then esstablish schools among them that will be of benefit to them, they would obtain knowledge and would make a good use of it. The gospel could then be introduced among them and they would be far more ready to recieve itwhen they find the white man is consistant & willing to do them good, but when the white man offers the gospel to the Indianone year & the next comes d& drives him from his home & the graveof his Fathers He has no faith or confidence in either the whiteman or his gospel3rd You can then introduce agriculture among them and they will recieve it for they would then see ofnecessity they must cultivate the land or die they could not depend upo[n] game for support and they would turn their attention to cultivating the soil make improvements and take delight in the same dway as the whiteman4th They would then be in a position whare they would be deliverd from the Ill consequences of constant removing which has continu[ally] 
 followed them for many years. And The Ill consequences of removing have been multiplied & vary great. This has been one main reason why schools have been unproductive of good among them. This is also whone reason why Missionaries have done no more good among themThe Indians are fast decreasing and Passing away what is thecause of all this. There are various causes Their constant remov-ing is one cause. Disease which has been introduced among them By white men in the capacity of traders, missionaries, and Emigrants Also the introduction of Alchoohol have had a tendency to waste themaway. Also wars among themselves & wars with white men all of which have continually wasted away the Indan tribesI will here remark that in the origin of the wars with the whites the conducting of those wars and in the treaties of peace made And broaken the Indians have been badly treated and abused by thewhites. For instance some ruffian or trader visites the Indiansintroduces wild fire or Alcohol among them & will get the Indiansdrunk & pehaps drunk himself and will cheat them in any way he can And perhaps kill some of them and in his career he gets killed himself, then the cry goes forth that the savage Indiansare killings & murdering the inhabitants of the country. it is proclaim-ed in all the public Journals of the Union. Yes one side of the story is proclaimed as with peals of thunder throughout the Earth But no voice is raised in behalf of the poor Indian. their story is not told the world hear it not they do not enquire or ask forit. But as soon as the story of the white man is told & proclaimedto the world, the armies of war must be prepared & soldierssent forth to drive and Kill the Indians and burn their home and in this way the most desolating and expensive wars have been carried on for many years untill we feel it is time for the whiteman to take a different course with the Indians.As an example of the bad Effects of continually removing theIndians I would refer you to the Cherokee Nation. That peoplewere fast imprioving following rapidly in the footsteps of the white man had extensive farms & good dwellings and continuallyed rapidly advancing in improvements untill they were suddenly brought to a stand in theire course by being cruelly called upon by the state of Georgia to give up their lands and go away from thegraves of their fathers into the wilderness and thus it was that the mighty nation instead of recieving that support encouragement& comfort from the Nation that He ought to recieve was forced By the cruel hand of oppression to bow their heads in sorrow anddispair as they wend their way to their so called home in the wilderness whare they can find no other hope ownly to pass a few more years in sorrow untill they shall be called to pass through the same ordeal again to remove and remove untill they are anhilated from off the face of the Earth. O Ye white man what incour-agement do you give the Indian to plant, to build, to learn, to cultivate the Earth, or to recieve a Religion that professes love mercy kindness and truth while those who profess to Enjoy it deals out such deeds of oppression & cruelty upon the heads of thered men that it drives them to madness and Despair. Let the American Nation stay their hand from this time forth in their oppression& drivings of the Indians lest they drive them beyound a point which the Indian will endure and return a Blow upon the head of the white man which will fill many a habitation with death. Once givethe Indians A Territory A home whare they can have a full assurance 
 that therier ears or those of their children will no more be saluted with a call to remove from their lands then if theydo not show forth a spirit of improvement then cast them off as not worthy of your support or attention but untill thenyou are not justifyed yur garments are not clearThe spirit of the age & times demands that Congress should takeimmediate action upon theis matter.1st The Indians cannot retain their lands. Emigration of the white men are already surround-ing them & in their midst and the richness & fertility of the Indians lands are a temptation to the white man and invite him to settle thereon.2nd The Indians have two much land more than what they need to till and cultivate for their support Let there be a Territory set off on the North west of Ioway North of Council Bluffs on the Missouri on which there is now nowhite settlement And let the Indians East of the Rocky moun-tains And in the United States be gatherd upon it. Then let otherTerritories in the west be appropriated And let all the Indians onthe North American Continant be collected together & learnedto cultivate the Earth. They will soon associate themselves together, and cease their wors among themselves also withthe white man. If there is not sumthing of this kind donethe vast Emigration through all the Indians lands will soon destroy the game & then want & starvation will ensue & this will bring on war between the white & Red men.If my Proposition is excepted by the American government And they will carry it out it will be of vast benefit both to the Indians And the people of the United States1st The Benefit to the Indians will be it will give them a perman[ent] home, whare schools can be esstablished among them and their children taught the English language. Farms can also be opened among them and when they see they have a permanent home for themselves and their children and they have no game to depend upon for food they will immediately go to work & cultivate the Earth like white men. The gospel can then be introducedamong them to a good Effect and they will recieve it with Thankfulness when they can be made to believe that thenthe hand that deals out the gospel to them is not laying a plan to take the advantage of them and preparing a way to drive themfrom their home & country. It will also unite not ownly their interest & attachment towards each other but their regard & interest with that of the United StatesThe benefit to the Government is less expenses1st Buying theire lands and Paying them yearly annuities whis is costing the Government immens sums of money 2nd The contiunual transporting of Indians from place to place there has already been 96000 indians removed by the govern-ment3rd The keeping of many Indian Agents at greatexpens to Government could then be dispensed with 4th Fortifications have now to be erected ion the borders of all India[n] tribes with the Intention of keeping the Indians in subjection these would not be needed of [if] the Indians were in a Territoryof their own for by having their trail clear & no encroachments ofthe white man upon their borders there would be no cause of waror fortifications. 
 I am going to Washington so on to lay my Petitionbefore the Congress of the United States and urged them to grant my Prayer for the benefit of both the whiteand Red men. I want your aid, I want you to sign mypetition that the voice of thousands may be bheard inbehalf of this petiontion. I want the names of LegeslatorsGovernors and American citizens in General that my prayer may be heard & answerd. Give the North American IndiansA home, a place whare the soles of their feet can rest in peacethen you will do your duty towards them, & place them in asituations whare you can teach them Literature, Agriculture,& Commerce, give them the chance the white man has, And IProphesy in the name of the Lord that there will ere long befound among them their Philosophers, Franklins, & Washing-tons, who would do honor to any civillized or ChristianNation on the globe. But let this Nation turn a deaf ear tomy Petitions and the Petitions of the Indians, continue to oppress them and drive them to desperation, and the hour is near when the campfire will be seen upon many a hill. The war hoop will reache from one end of the RockyMountains to the other. The Indian will then sell his life as dear as possible and deal out death whareever an opportunit[y]offers. When this blow is struk It will be Terrible to allMay God forbid that shch such a blow should fall at all, that thescenes of Bloody Brook should any more be enacted.American Citizens it is to ward of this blow that I now standbefore you, That I now call upon this Nation bearing a petitionunto them, will you hear my Prayer, will you give the Indian his rights, will you help bury the hate hat foreverOr will you make a grave to bury your dead I leave you to DECIDE The following is A true copy of the PetitionTo the Honorable the Senate and House of RepresentativesThe memorial of the undersigned citizens and Residence of the United States Most Respectfully showethThat the present state of the Indian Tribes within the jurisdictionof the United States and the continant of North America isa subject worthy of the consideration of evry Christian andphilanthropist in this union. That if by any practical methodthese Aboriginal and Primitive owners of the soil can be civillized and incorporated into the body politic as enlightened and usefulcitizens no time should be lost in making the attempt.The rapid advancing spirit of the age presents this subject before Congress as indispensible to be acted upon now. With this subject inview and with earnest prayer to Almighty God to Enlighten your councilson this momentous subject we the under signed present the cause of the Indians to the Earnest consideration of your Honorable Bodypraying that such means may be spedily adopted that will give to theRed Man a permanent home and all the Arts conveniences and com-forts of civillized life. To this End we pray that A sufficent portion of thegreat North Western Territory may be appropriated to this use for thereception & consentration of such of the Indian Tribes as may Be willing to become agricult-urist and recieve from the hands of the white man a sound ysystem of moral & intellectual training. The land so appropriated to be erected into an Indian District subject to such form of goverment & such laws as Congress may deem consistant with the constitution & laws of the United States 
 Mr Copway remarked to W. Woodruff in personal conversationThat He had long contemplated the situation of the poor Indians andhe well know their position and feelings and if the United Statesdid not soon take a different course and scease their persecutionsand oppressions and driving the Indians to such extremities as theywere doing that the Indians would soon rise up in their wrath Unite together and seek revenge and strike a Blow unto death Andit was in consequence of a knowledge of this fact that had inspiredhim to go through the United States call meetings and lecture before the people and strive to call the attention of the white men to use his influence to assist in staying this spirit of oppression against the Indian. But I meet with but little success the Christians ofthis day manifest but little sympathy with me. I was a while withthe Methodist and If I would confine myself with there doctrines theywould help me but the moment that I wanted my liberty to bee freeand act independantly they would forsake me but I am tired of suchbigotry I am resolved to do all in my power to call upon the people and Government that my garments may be clear in trying to ward off theblow which I know will come if the people of the United Statesdo not scease their oppressions And when it does come I had rathernot be alive than to see what will follow. But if they will not harkento my petition nor to the cry of the Indians I am as ready to die at the cannons mouth as any whare els I will go before Congress and talk plain before them And tell them that I want them to do sumthingwith me for the Indians that we have bourn affliction & oppressionfrom the hand of the people of the United States all the day long and it is time it was stoped. The world have accused us of beingconnected with the Mormons to overthrow the Government I shalltell them it is false there has been no such combination at allbut I shall tell them the Indians have treated the India whitemen well. And so have the Mormons thereated the Indians well And the People of the United States And even have fed their enemies And helped them while in distress in the willderness. The Mormons have never given the wIandians any councilto go to war with the whites or with themselves but always have councilled them to make peace. This principle I shall declare upon thefloor of the Halls of Congress. But says this Lamanite Chief If this Nation does not hear us, does not help us does not cease theriroppression still we have hope, for the Great SPIRIT will at last both Hear Help and Deliver us For as A people we shall notdie, for If the Lord has to raise us up help out of the Rocky Mountains that Help will arise which will both save us and do us GOOD[rest of page blank] 
 Views of Col. Thomas L. Kane on a Government for DeseretNov 26th 1849 In company with Dr J. M. Bernhisel I called uponCol Kane to have an interview with him In Relation to Petitioning Congressfor the reception of the State of Deseret into the UnionThe following is a synopsis of the conversation of Col KaneYou must not commit yourselves to any party but keep a close mouth with all parties and the utmost discreet and wise course must be pursued in order to do any thing at all. I will do what I can with the free soil party. My Father and Mr Dallest with the Democ-rats. It will be the most critical Congress ever held. "I Applyedaccording to the wish of President Young for a Territorial Gove-rnment I had my last sad and Painful interview with Presi-dent Polk I found He did not feel disposed to favor your People and had his men of his own stamp picked out to serveas Govornor & other officers who would have oppressed You or injured you in any way to fill their own Pockets He would notappoint men from among yourselves. And I saw it absolutelynecessary that you should have officers of your own people to governyou or you were better without any Government. I had to use myown discretion and I withdrew the Petition I am fully decidedupon that point that you must have officers of yourselves, & not military Politiscians who are struting around in your midstusurping Authority over you. It will not do for you to take the slavery question or Antislavery or any other side but the nutral.Atchinson of Missouri with the Mormon opposing party will still beyour enemies Thomas Benton has been an inveterate enemy andstill may be. And all the Parties with the whole of Congress is a massof corruption & abomination they are all governed by party manage-ment without any regard to principle & if we do any thing upon this subject we shall have to Enter into wise Management wemay have to favor the south some though they are your Enemiesand I hate to do it. Parties are all breaking up And New Onesforming and no man can tel what a day will bring forth.Thomas Benton was at the Head of your being driven from Winter Quarters the Indian Country and Polk favored it andI could not turn them from their purpose I told Mr Polk weshould not present any Petition while He dictated matters.Benton is still your Enemy at heart.Douglass is going down with a certain class connected with him. The time was when He could have done your People much good by merely bearinghis Testimony of your good character while he was as Judge inIllinoise and He would not do it (Let this be remembered)Col Kane remarked that from the acquaintance I have had with Mr Bxxxxx I Apprehend entertain serious Apprehentions that He will by hiscourse at Washington injure your cause, He was formerly A small politition but a rough one of the Missouri Stamp and this in my view to some extent would disqualify him for the business Besides He expresseda want of confidence in his wisdom prudence and discretion tomanage this affair and that He would associate with an inferiorclass of men in the lower House which would also exhert a prejudi-cal effect upon our cause 
 The following remarks were made By Col Kane to W Woodruff Dec 4th 1849Col Kane remarked You are better without any Government from the hands of Congress than a Territorial Goverment. The Politicalintreagues of Government Officers will be against you. You can governyourselves better than they can govern you. I would prefer tosee you withdraw the Bill than to have a Territorial Government for if you are defeated in the State Government you can fallupon it again at another session if you are not a TerritorialGovernment but if you are you cannot apply for a state Governmentfor a number of years. I insist upon it you do not wantcorurupt Political men from Washington strutting aroundyou with military epilets & dress, who will spec[u]late out of youall they can. They will also control the Indian Agency land Agency and will conflict with your calculation in a greatmeasure. You do not want two Governments with you you have a Government now which is firm & Powerful and You areunder no obligations to the United States You owe themnothing but kicks cuffs and the treatment of wicked dogsfor that is the ownly treatment you have recieved from theirhands since you have been a People. ("And the golden rule is whatmeasure men meet out shall be measured to them again")Brigham Young should be your Govornor. His head is notfilled with Law Books and Lawyieers tactics but he has power tosee through men & things And all councillors Elders & agents [abroad]should be made to know their place, sustain the head man & workfor the general good in all things and not act from selfish motivesor to get some petty office or a little salary. He said if we you did make up our minds to ask for a Territory we should use evry exhertionin our power to get the assureance of the President that our choice should be granted us in a Govornor & other officers sayBrigham Young for Govornor &c But if we could not getthis assurance not to ask for it at all but wait the resultHe said If we were a state, there might be ever so many men come along and say I am Judge, I am Col, I am GenYou can whistle and ask no odds of them. But while a TerritoryYou cannot do it. And then their is always so many intriguesto make Political parties among you, the first thing you knowA strong Political party is rising up in your midst who are selfishAnd against your interest.Col Kane requested me to rememberwhat He had said to me as He might not have hea[l]th to do for uswhat he was now doing And He wished his views to be knownto the Presidency in the valley. I remarked to him that I woulddo so and Pray for his success in our behalf also for his hea[l]th strength & prosperity. He thanked me & said He should Prize our prayersHighly.I felt impressed that Col Kane was Endowed with much wisdom in his course in our be half and I think that He had right viewsof things in General[rest of page blank] 
 Signs of the times and remarks upon the year AD. 1849The narrative of the year 1849 forms A remarkable chapter in the Historyof the world, perhaps no single year has embraced a greater number of important events or involved so great & lasting consequences in such a variety of relations. The overthrow of the Sikhs the esstablishment of the British Power on the ruins of the sikh dynasty the deposition of the pope the declaration of the Roman Republic and its early extin[c]tion by the Frenchintervention & the struggles in sardinia, the movements of the people in Jerm-any; the contest between the Danes And Jermans; the intervention of Russiain Hungaryian affairs; the fall of Hungary; the overthrow of Venice andthe movements in the national mind of France on social questions are allpregnant with vast Results Also the passing of the Bill in the British Parliament on the 23rd of Feb granting to Jews the right to seats in the Parliament of GreatBritiain is one strong omien of the redemption of that Peculiar people. These in connexion with storms, whirlwinds, Earthquakes, fires and the most desolating pestilence & Plagues which has swept over Europe & Eastern world shows clearly to the reflecting mind who has any portion of the Testimony of Jesus Christthat the Great God has commenced his controversy with all Nations and that Great Babylon is coming in Rememberance befor God. And when we turn ourattention to the western Hemisphere the United States of America, any true seer might Justly say that notwithstanding thy Nation O Landlike the Antedeluvian world & Sodom & Gomorrow boast of their union strengthgoodness greatness & glory. Yet is here that I behold the signs of the times big with Events, it is here that I behold the clouds thicken theHeavens gather Blackness, And the wrath of God ready to fall upon they head For thou aret worthy. Notwithstanding O America thou art blowing aloudthy trumpet of fame & honor to all the world in sympathizing with Cossuthand other Brave Hungarians and offering a Home to the oppressed of All nations, still thou art the man who dare commit the blackest deeds of the Earth. It is here the God of Heaven has commenced to set up his kingdom and offered thee the gospel of Jesus Christ to savethe from the wrath of God. It is here whare that kingdom & gospel hasbeen rejected first. It is here whare Presidents Govornors Judgesand rulers of the Land with thousands of the people have broaken the laws & Constitution of the United States and the several states by turning mob And persecuting many of their own citizens who were the saints of God, have deprived them of the rights of citizenship, burned their goods & dwellings, taken some of them prisiooners held mock trials overthem by a mob Jury who were their Jury by Day & guard by night whowould pour whiskey down each others throats And then God Dam God, And Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost, And evry religious sect they could think of & close their songs twith the words God Dam the God dDam Mormons then would imprision the saints in chains and feed them on Human flesh, And finally murdered many of the Saints with the Phrophets whom God hath sent unto them to call them to Repentance And when those persecuted American cities [citizens] pled at the feet of the Presidents Govornors and Judges of the Nation, they have been rejected & ridiculed while at the same time they have in some instances been informed that there cause was Just. And even down to the present day evry Petition presented by the Saints of God who have been driven into the wilderness by the cruel hand hand of oppression is rejected in evry possible way Because of thesethings the Lord hath said that He will arise out of his Hiding placeand in his fury He will vex the Nation And in his Hot displeasure 
 will cut off those wicked and unjust stewards and Appoint them Portion with Hypocrites & unbelievers. One glance at the signs of 1849 in the United States will show that the Lord has commencedto fulfill his promise And He will not scease untill it is finished There has never been A year since the esstablishment of the UnitedStates Government, when there has been so great a loss of property & life by fire & Pestilence, or such an increase of mobs or confusionand Perplexity in the Government as in 1849. Among the most desolat-ing fires may be named the burning of Watertown on Sunday the 13th of April $121,000 worth of property destroyed. five days after on the 18 of April the tremendious conflagration at St Louis more than half the businesspartof the city was burned $6000000 worth of property destroyed. The Plague also in the form of the cholera visited the same city soon after the fire and in few weeks laid in the grave 8000 of its inhabitants the cholera ahas also swept many thousand into the grave in various parts of the United States. it has raged through most parts of the land during the past season. Mobs have also increased to an alarming degree in the United States, in New York, Philadelphia, ^&^ Portland, they have been very consp-icuous. The desolution of the American Union also seems to be fast ripening during the past year. the slavery question seems to be the great hinge upon which the Nation will split At the meeting of Congressthe House spent 18 days in organizing the House & Electing the speakerwhich cost the Goverment near $100000, And it continues to be one of the most exciting Congresses ever met in the United States And if the war spirit now visible in the midst of Congress continuesto increase It is quite probable that the Union may be dissolved beforethe close of this session. Although many Editors of the public Journalshave ridiculed for several years the Idea of the Dividing of the American Union but this year thisey feel vary serious upon the subject And all thesigns of the times in this government indicate that the hand writing upon the wall is begining to be visibly seen concerning the fate of this Nation.When we turn our eyes towards Zion during the year 1849 we canbehold the hand of the Lord also visible in her behalf. The Lord hath promised great Blessings concerning Zion And the faithful Saints are watching all signs appertaining to her with feelings of the deepest interest. for years past Zion has been oppressed and as a captive removeing to and fromo but she has finally found a resting place in the rich valleys of Ephraim in the great Bason between the High Mountains & Everlasting Hills of North America And during the year 1849 she has organized herself unto an Indipendant sovreign StateAnd appointed her Governor & Nobles of themselves, so that Her Nobles areof themselves & her Govornor has proceded out of the midst of Ephraimin Zion she has prospered more than during any year since her organization she is rapidly building up a city in peace, has good crops, universalHealth, has made Arangements to lay of three New cities. Has re-organized her marshal Legion of mighty men. 100 families have gone 200 miles South to form A settlement under the Presidency of Bishop Morley in the sand Pitch valley. The Church during this years haves laid the foundation for a fund called the perpetual fund the object of which is to gather unto Zion all the poor saints who cannot gather themselves fromCouncil Bluffs, the United States And from all the world, expect-ing it to increase yearly untill all Israel is gatherd this fund is esstablishedby voluntary contributions of the Saints $5,500 was collected in the valley in this way in one month And Bishop Edward Hunter was sent to 
 Council Bluffs with the money to buy oxen to take up the poor from there to the valley the coming spring. The Elders of Israel are also determined to send the gospel to all the world as soon as possible All of the Apostles who were in the valley have had missions assigned them. Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball, & Willard Richards compose the first Presidency. Orson Hyde the President of the Twelve the following are the full quorum of the present Twelve, Orson Hyde Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A.Smith, Amasa Lyman, Charles Ezra T. Benson, Charles C RichLorenzo Snow, Erastus Snow, & Franklin D Richards. Orson Hyde is publishing the Guardian & presiding at Council Bluffs Parley P. Pratt is Appointed to preside over the Pacific Islands Orson Pratt is doing a great work in England some ten ortwelve thousand have been baptized under his Presidency During 1849. Wilford Woodruff has been presiding over the Eastern States & Canidas & has travelled over 5000 miles amongthe churches And is now called upon to gather the remnantsto Zion George A. Smith And Ezra T. Benson has led a camp of the saints from the Bluffs to the valley through many dangers Amasa Lyman & Charles C Rich Are at San Franciscopresiding over western Calafornia. John Taylor Lorenzo Snow, Erastus Snow, & Franklin D. Richards, with about 20 Elders have arived in the States from the valley On mission to England, France Italy Denmark & Sweden so evry thing is prospering in the Church & kingdom of God And All thesigns of the Times bespeak the comping of the Lord Jesus ChristWhat 1850 will bring to pass time must determin but it is certain it will be full of the Events of the times. The History of Each year is important now Plagues, war, fire & Pestilence & famine will lay many low in death: who will live. I am expectingto start in April to lead A company to the Bluffs & on to the valley the dangers are many I shall have to go through, But I Pray my Heavenly Father to protect & sustain me & those who shal go with me that we may reach in safety. I Also pray to the Lord to preserve & bless the Twelve And all the Elders of Israel who go on foreign missions, And Bless the Presidency with the power of God, & cause Zion to arise And put on her beautiful garments I pray that the oppressions of Zion may scease that her inhabita-nts may have power to build Houses & inhabit them plantvineyards and eat the fruit thereof. I Pray that her landing maybe like the Garden of the Lord that she may have the early &latter rain that the Land may bring forth ofin her stregngth.O, Lord order our cause aright which is before the Congress of this Nation may all things work together for the good of thisy saints, preserve us all from Evil of evry kind and help us to dothy will in all things on the Earth. O Lord Hasten the gathering of Israel, who are cast out And the dispersed of Judagh may theLamanites soon blossom like the rose, May the Zion of God who has risenand gone up into the mountains be clothed upon with wrighteousnessand the power of God. May the Church become prepared like a bride prepared for the coming of the Bridegroom And myay theyPeople not ownly have cause to rejoice in the Holy One of Israel during the AD 1850 But through all time And All Eternity

They spoke of their great celebration on the 24th July as being a daylong to be remembered. 15 brethren had arived from the gold countrysome had plenty of gold some were as destitute as when they went on boardof the ship Brooklin. "The true use of gold was for paving streets covering houses & makeing culinary dishes & when the saints shall havepreached the gospel raised grain & built up cities enough the Lord willopen up the way for a supply of gold to the perfect satisfaction of hispeople. They hadve laid the foundation for a perpetual fund for thepurpose of gathering all the poor saints to Zion who cannot gather themselves untill all the poor ar gatherd from Council Bluffs, the UnitedStates and all the World And $5,500 isas the first fruits of it is sentto Kanesvill by the hand of Bishop Hunter to buy oxen to take the poor with him to Zion this season & then Each year to return to the

The Epistle also makes the following remarks Elder Orson Pratt is Doing a great work in England & the cause of truth is ad-vanceing rapidly in all her home dominions & the rejoiceing of the Saintscauses satan to howl for he is compelled to be subject to the power of the highest. "Elder Woodruff is located at Cambridgeport Massand has been comforting and instructing the saints in Canialaand the Eastern States the Past year. If Elder Woodruff will gather up all the saints in his vicinity and come with them to this place He will be doing a great work and will be opening a way for a visit to thoseNations who have both eyes and ears and are crying to the Elders of Israelcome tell ofus of the things of God for we have heard that God is withyou."
