ENDENTRY Springville Nov. 21st 1884  Prest Wilford Woodruff Historian of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,  Dear Brother;  Feeling the importance of having incidents that have transpired in our history and phenomena which we accept as evidence of the com- ing forth of the work of the last days—therefore I consider it my duty to present a few items for your consideration to be placed upon the pages of our History, if you deem it worthy of a place there.  One circumstance was a phenomenon which occured in my boyhood, which was seen by my Father's family—I being among them. I think it must have occurred 1825 and 1830. I should think about the month of September between the hours of 6 and 9 o'clk. in the evening.  We saw a very large army of Soldiers (to all appearance) marching in the firmament, coming from a North Westerly direction and meeting a similar army from a South Easterly direction, nearly over our heads. We were standing at the West door of my father's house and saw the army from the North West most distinctly and saw the front of the opposite army also.  We saw them march up and apparently discharge firearms and I am almost sure that I saw the flash of the same, and probably heard the report, but being but a child, and it being about 55 years ago, I would not like to be too positive as to hearing ENDENTRY On the 20th of October 1881 Bro David Cook and of East Bountiful, Davis Co and myself whilst engaged in conducting services in the open air notwithstanding we were strictly guarded in our utterances. We were violently assauted by a reckless mob led on by the following persons. James Cousins carpenter, Samuel Yarwood cab proprietor, and Matthew Sweetman coal proprietor, they followed us with threats and imprecations to our abode and then requested that we should be brought forth to them. The first named of those leaders, has annoyed our brethren for many years past, and in my hearing has declared that he will never cease as long as he has a breath to draw.

Respected, and Dear Sir-  If agreeable to yourself, I would be pleased to have an interview with you relative to the great beneficiary work in which it is my privilege to be engaged.  The "Woodmen of the world," is one of the most liberal, yet one of the most careful, societies in the world, as to the habits, morals, and character of the men who compose its membership. The practical benefits it brings to its membership, are of the most desirable char- acter. It is non-religious, and non-political in its realation to the various churches, or poloitical parties.  Your people, are just as much entitled to the benefits of this society, as any in the broad earth; and it is to tell you all about "The Woodmen," and looking toward the enlisting of your people in this purely mutual benefit society, that I desire to see you.  Will you kindly name the time and place that I may call.  Praying the blessing of HIM who can, and will direct in all good, to bless you with great wisdom, and grace,  I am my dear sir-  Yours Very Truly- W S Falkenburg. Deputy Head Consul, W. O.

There is a slight mistake or two in the Type written copiys; After writing this article; my wife read it over to me the first time, after reading it she said, Pa you aught to send that to President Woodruff! At the same instant, the same feeling came upon me. Soon after this my Brother in Law Bishop White ^Brothers^ Jos Parry and David M Stewart called in to see me. I let them read the article ENDENTRY I wish also to state that I have at different times heard my Father Kirtland O. to visit the Prophet at the time that the first Council was called in relation to building the Temple in that place.  Aaron C. Lyon had accompanied my Father from our residen ce in Genesee Co. N. Y. to Kirtland O.  Joseph invi- ted them to attend the Council, and after opening the same he presented the business of building the Temple to the people convened, and then called upon those present for an expression of their feelings.  When most of the brethren pres- ent seemed to feel that the Church was too poor to build a building of the magnitude required, and thought they had better build something smaller and less expensive. During the discussion Father Lyon and my Father, step'd to one side and conferred together as to whether they had any money to spare for this purpose, and have sufficient left to take them home. They concluded they could spare a trifle each. They returned and pre- sented (if my memory serves me right) A. C. Lyon $10.00 Asahel Perry $5.00 Whereupon Joseph arose (and as my Father said) spoke in a very energetic manner saying the work had commenced and the House would be built according to the pattern presented.  In the month of May 1836 we moved to Kirtland and bought a farm. Some time after many of the Saints being in very distressed circumstances, my Father gave to Joseph $10000 in money for the benefit of the poor. ENDENTRY Ansd. Dec. 10. 80 W. G. SMITH, PRES'T.  R.

For this remaining amount of $3200.00 he drew orders on the Church in Missouri.

He has addressed a pamphlet of sixteen pages to the Latter Day Saints, scattered abroad, and to every body else, containing his appeals to them, and the cogitations of his own mind.  If the Lord had inspired him to write his appeal, it would have been received with respect and cordiality. But it would seem that his inspiration came from no higher source than George Miller. He speaks much about being put out of his place and some one also called to fill it. If this had been contemplated, and even carried into effect, the Council of the Church would not have gone beyond their power and right, if they had thought it necessary to be done: But to reproach the person supposed to occupy his place with the appellation of "A LONG EARED JACK ASS," is but to reproach the Council by whom he was appointed, if appointed at all. The spirit of alienation and jealousy is too apparent in his writings: No person has been suggested to fill his place, to my knowledge; and if he had been dictated by the Spirit of the Lord, he would have written a confidential letter to the Council of his brethren, and enquired into all these matters, before venturing to throw out such a volley of most extravagant and uncalled for language as his pamphlet contains. But it seems that he has taken Bishop Miller for his prompter, who lost the Spirit of the Lord by his over anxiety to run forward to Grand Island, to Punkand, and to "Bullyhuck," that he might show himself a little smarter man than any other in the camp: and when the Spirit of the Lord had left him, he learned that the Twelve were not right, and resolved to follow them no longer, when the truth was, he never would follow, but always run ahead. He left the body of the Church without counsel and without the fellowship of the Saints.  If Bro. Wight had been as anxious to keep up a friendly intercourse and correspondence with the Church and Council, and maintain a perma- nent union and alliance with them, as he now is to sow the seeds of dissension, by scattering his pamphlets among the OUTER BRANCHES of the Church, could he not long ago have sent a messenger to hunt us up, as well as to send one now to distribute his pamphlets, the products of his own misguided zeal, breathing manifestly the spirit of separation from the Church and Council? If we were broken up and gone from Nauvoo, we were not gone out of the world. The very spirit of his apology for not writing to us, clearly shows that he lacked more the inclination to write than the opportunity of sending a letter. This is in accordance with some expressions of his concerning his desire to be accounted as one of the Twelve on his leaving Nauvoo. It may be proper, at some time, to note them.  He appeals to those of like ordination with himself to know if they have any power or authority given them to remove him from his station. For one, I can say that I have been ordained to all the power and authority that Bro. Wight ever was, and I can inform him that he is not yet so high that the voice of the Council cannot reach him and bring him down, and even put another in his place if they deem it necessary. Sidney Rigdon was ordained to all that Bro. Wight ever was, and rather more, but the arm and voice of God's Council brought him down and dried up the fountain of his spirits. Lucifer was even higher than Bro. Wight, yet he was thrust down by those with whom he stood connected: and be it known, and known to all, that the Council has power to expel any member of its body from the same, when that member ceases to act pursu- ant to its dictates. If this be not a true doctrine, Lucifer could have stood his ground in heaven and bid as loudly defiance to the powers there, as Bro. Wight has in his pamplet to all the powers of the world, the Church, Angels and men. But the former was cast down, and the Council at the Salt Lake City, with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, must determine the portion of the latter after having canvassed his pamphlet and considered it in connection with this circular.  Why does Bro. Wight teach and enforce a doctrine that Joseph Smith never did nor never would sanction? Namely: a community of goods, or property thrown in together as common stock. Though this doctrine has sometimes been practiced by good men, but the original purpose and design of God was to make men accountable for their stewartship, and therefore, "to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;  and to every man according to his several ability." The whole course and order of nature—the constitutional organization of man—the voice of the martyred prophet of the last days, and the eternal purpose of God, all stand opposed to Bro. Wight's "common stock" principles; and no people can prosper that enforce this as a law among themselves. I call not upon Heaven and Earth, Angels and men for my "indemnity," but let my communications be yea, yea, and nay, nay; and leave the remainder to Bro. Lyman.  With regard to keys and priesthood, Bro. Wight is just as lame as he is about the power not existing to displace him, and one day it will meet him in the face; and though I am a fool, there ARE men in this Church that can measure his bushel in their peck without shaking down or pressing it together. Men have done something here besides wearing fine clothes, and have learned something better and more generous than to throw out any such low insinuations.  When men get a mission according to their own hearts' desires in answer to long and repeated importunities, they ought not to murmur or complain at their hardships if they even have "to sell their last coat for food." It was a work craved because of an apparent unwillingness to remain with the Council and fare as they did, receive the chastisements and corrections which they did, and thus become perfected in the midst of counsel. Israel once received a king because of their great murmurings and importunities, but was he a blessing or a curse to them? It is said not to be the nature of "the wild ram of the mountains" to herd in the domestic fold, and if it does not yet appear that Joseph Smith gave to Lyman Wight his great mission with a similar motive to that with which the Lord gave a soul to Israel, I will confess my mistake.  The Churches are exhorted to continue their emigration and in the discharge of their various duties, as counselled and directed in the late General Epistle of the Twelve, and pay no attention to Bro. Wight's call until it is sanctioned by the First Presidency of the Church, at the Salt Lake City, and also by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Bro. Wight may collect around him the whole phalanx of wild, disaffected and in- dependent spirits, even from the "Pagan Prophet" down to the "Brewster Seer." But these combustible materials, gathered together, render explosion more certain and its consequences more destructive. None of us are at war with Bro. Wight's mission, but with his boasting and de- fying spirit.  The next circular that I issue, I hope may come from our own press at Council Bluffs, under the head of the "FRONTIER GUARDIAN."  Now, Brethren, farewell! May the blessing of Him who died and rose again from the dead, be with you always and keep you steadfast and immovable in the truth, and guide your steps to the celestial city where the Saints meet in peace.  With great respect, I have the honor to be,  Your brother in the Bonds of the Covenant,  ORSON HYDE. ENDENTRY Cambridgeport Mass Feb 24th 1849  President Young and Council,  Dear Brethren,  Since I have  been travelling in this eastern country which is so Highly famed  for the education of their children, I have endeavoured to bear in mind  that portion of the epistle which councils the Saints, "To secure at least A copy of  Evry valuable treatise on Education" andc, andc. I have reflected much upon this subject, and  the situation of the Saints in the valley, the thousands of children that will be  congregated there. And not ownly the importance of their having school Books to  read and learn from, but the importance of their having such Books as will attract  their attention, and be adapted to the capacity of children, and youth. Also of intro- ducing a class of Books that will be accepted and recommended by the Presidency or a Board of Education which they may appoint, as their would be a great Benefit  derived in Having a uniformity of school Books introduced throughout the  schools of the Latter day Saints. I have not supposed that the Saints would  vary materially from the world in introducing the first rudiments of education  into their schools, ownly to make the best selection they could. The Saints  would of course differ from the world and Christendom in their religious teaching  which in some measure would be a seperate branch from teaching the common  branches of education.  It has been under this view of the  subject that I have taken pains to investigate the present system of education  in New England, And obtain copies of some maps, charts, Books andc and the report of their board of education. The State of Maine and others are making  great improvements in their system of education, introducing new modes of  teaching, using the Black board, making New school Houses upon a New plan, ventilating at the top of the windows, making pleasure grouds andc andc. A copy of the drafts I  forward to you with this letter which you will find is a Book entitled  Report of the Board of Education of the State of 1847. A New series of Books  are now being introduced through the U. S. which are prefered before all others  they were got up by a company of Men in the city of Portland Maine  by A board of Education which was composed (it was said) of the best talent,  of the country, who collected a copy of all the works in use in the United States, and out of them and their own branes formed the Books.

We are thankful that a deeply earnest, devout, spirit characterizes the administrations of the brethren and sisters who assist in the Temple and the same spirit evidently rests upon those who are administered to.  Part of the month, as you have already learned, my health has been poor, such indeed as to keep me away from the Temple on some of the working days.

I trust you in a measure are having a rest for a season from the many cares and labors which have rested upon you while in this City.

I seat myself once more in this life to make an address to you with pen and ink. I have now lying before me three letters from you of dates—Feb'y 11th (by A. Fielding) June 27th and lastly August 21st for all of which favors I feel thankful; for you may rest assured they operate upon my spirit like a live coal from off the altar and kindles a flame in my soul. I feel to magnify the name of God for the manner he has sustained, inspired and upheld you since the death of Hyrum and the way he is giving a signal victory to the citizens of Zion the city of Joseph. I look upon it myself, as a great omen and evidence that the time has come to favour Zion, and that her Sun and Light must and shall speedily go forth propelled by the spirit and strength of the God of Israel, until Zion arises with all her strength, power, Beauty and Glory until she fully accomplishes all that the ancient prophets anticipated; yea: I rejoice in the prosperity of all, of which your letters speak. My prayers have ascended day and night before God that he would not only do by His servant Brigham Young as he did by Moses but that he would do as much better by him as the greatness labour and work of this dispensation required. ##Joshua 1:1-9## I have also remembered all the Twelve and Elders in all the world. I thank you for all the information and instruction you have given me and of so often speaking of our only son in Zion. We  are all well at present. Our youngest son is two months old, the largest and healthiest child we ever had of his age. All is going on as well as can be expected in this country considering all thinges. the few wise labourers andc. Elder Jones I think is doing well in Wales; he has laboured faithfully and sown much seed that is now taking root and beginning to bring forth much fruit; within a few days past they have baptized two Campbellite Evangelists or ministers and they are ordained priests (I ordained one of them) and a prospect of their doing much good. Brother Jones has preached very extensively in the largest cities and towns through the Welsh domains, and said, there were nearly a hundred added to the branches in that land a few weeks before he left to pay me a visit.  I have held on to what few American Elders there are in this land according to your request except Elders Holmes and George Town, Masss—they had settled their affairs and were about ready to sail when your letter arrived, and Elder Hardy's family is in such a situation, he is obliged to go home so I did not stop them. But I think we can hold our own until some help comes from Nauvoo. The company of some Elders from there as soon as they get their endowment will meet with a welcome reception in this land. And now while I think of it, I have two requests to make of President Young The first is that he will particularly instruct all Elders who come to this land to see me first before they go into the field and hearken to my counsel and cooperate with me in all things in the vineyard (you will see the reason of this request when you have read the whole of this communcation) and also that you will notify me who have received their endowment and who have not. And the next very important request is, that ENDENTRY Their original form.

They called upon me and made inquiries concerning the probable population of the valley. They conversed with me much upon the subject and wished to make you a present of a copy of their works for your Examination, esspecially the readers, which they forwarded to me and I forward them to you according to their requst. I forward 13 Books As A present from them. four Towns Readers, Towns speller and definer, Three sizes of Greenleaf' Arithmetic and one Key, Towns Analysis, Welds parsing Book and Grammar, And Weld' Latin Lesson and Reader. I also foward with them, The report of the board of Education in the State of Maine, Laws statury statutory to public schools in the State of Maine, And the report of the superintending school committee of Jay. My motive in forwarding the things is that peradventure there may be sumthing gleaned out of them that may be of some benefit to the Saints in their School Arangements.  Mr Carter said that should you feel disposed to adopt the Towns Readers  into your schools, That they would furnish theym already made, at a low rate. or send you A new set of sterrotype plates, to print them in the valley at a small percentage A thousand, or if we felt disposed to take them in the printed sheet, they would let us have them cheaper than we could do the press work in the valley, unless we had steam presses the printed sheeets would come to but little more by the ream or token than than the blank paper I conversed with them upon all these points. They would deliver the Books or printed sheets well packed in Boxes at New Orleans, free of charge ^for freight^ at any place we should direct.

I left the Saints in Pottawatamie Co Ioway on the 21st of June with my family to procede by land to the O. Hyde with the Saints, at Mount Pisgah, Appointed A new Presiding Elder, and Council, Had a good meeting, and left all parties Apparently satisfyed. I Also held A meeting with Elder Kington and  the Saints At garden Grove And had A pleasant time with them. On the 5th July while on my Journey I drove my carriage into the dooryard of Br James Williams to spend the night I tied my multes to A large sound oak tree in A lot on the opposite side of the road. As I was about to retire to bed in my carriage with my family as usual, A still small voice whispered to me in in An intelligent manner And told me to remove my Mules and carriage from whare they were, I looked Around And could see no danger: yet I done As the spirit told me, tied my Mules in A little groves, And moved mey waggon some rods And set it beside the House, And retired to bed: but had not been there but few moments before A whirlwind struck us, And tore the oak tree from its foundation And it came thundering to the Earth, And the main body of it fell length ways whare ymy carriage stood, which had it not have been moved would probably have been crushed to the Earth, And myself And family killed, Also the Mules. But through the mercy of God we were all saved, for which blessing I felt to offer up the gratitude of my heart. It was A striking proof of the benefits to be derived from harkning to the teachings of that still small voice. On Sunday the 9th July in company with Brs Dana, I went on to the roof of the Temple in Nauvoo, And had A view of that once flourishing but now desolate city. The people were in quite A state of Excitement from A report in circulation that Elder Hyde was to preach in the Temple on that day's many came in waggons from the country to hear A Preach or have a fight, it Appeared to be all the same with them. But Br Hyde had given out no appointment. And their was no fighting, And no Preaching, Except what I done to A single individual who had come As A deligate, from some People living in Council Bluffs to investigate Mormonishm, who professed to be ready to embrace truth wharever they could find it I preached to him one hour, then Baptized him, confirmed him, (in George A Smith' House) and ordained him An Elder, gave him A licence And what council I could.

And if the presidency should feel disposed  to adopt any particular class of Books say Towns  Readers or any others and their could be means  raised from any sourse to purchase a few thousand of them And a way to get  them to the valley that it would be an immediate benifit to the children and youth; Yet I do not consider it to be my place Neither do I feel dispose to attempt to council you upon this or any other subject that I speak of, ownly  to lay them before you for your consideration, then let them be  governed by your counsel and Direction. I am picking up some maps, charts,  Histories andc which I have not an opportunity of forwarding at this time  Wilford Woodruff  PS.

This Government are altering many of their laws and drawing the reins very tight on many things and this is one of them: it matters not whether letters are sealed or unsealed or whether there be any directions or address upon them or whether they are open in sheets in a portfolio or done up it is all the same. if there be a sheet of writing of any kind except what directly concerns the individual himself, it is £5 or 25 dollars fine for every such piece of paper and there is no getting away from it. Brother Fielding and others escaped only with the skin of their teeth. If an Elder should be caught with 200 letters about his person or in his trunk, nothing could save him. Neither we nor himself could pay the fine. Imprisonment or transportation would be the result, besides ruining us. for if they knew this was done by one of our society their vengeance would be heaped on our heads. I have made this or similar statements in several letters to Nauvoo but it seems to have no effect, however. I pray that this may suffice. All Elders that receive letters should put them all into the Letter bag when they come to the ship. I do not ask any man to send any letter to me only what comes through the post. I had much rather pay the postage than endanger the cause of God. I got damned the other day, enough to sinke a 120- gun-ship, in getting Brother Taylor's Times and Seasins through the custom House merely because they were Mormon papers.  I received, for the first time, yesterday—The Proclamation of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Christ to the Kings and Rulers of the Nations of the Earth. It is truly a solemn proclam- ation and I consider it will be to the Kingdoms of the Gentiles, the same as "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin" to Belshazzar. I see that I am to give it as wide a circulation as possible through- out these dominions (I suppose this request was made, of course, by your counsel) so I shall endeavour to attend to it. what the effect will be in this government, time must determine. some think this Government will notice it and turn their persecutions upon us. But, be it so. The Lord God has spoken and I will obey. The Presidency have counselled and I will give heed, if it cost me my life. The Kings, Lords, Rulers and Rich among the Gentiles shall never have it to say in the Day of Judgment that they were hindered from having an invitation to the Great Feast and marriage supper of the lamb because Wilford Woodruff was ^afraid^ of his life. No. God forbid I would rather go to the Scafford or the guillotine. My voice is—Let the Kings and princes hear the word of the Lord and the solemn proclamation of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb whether they will hear ofr forbear, then, if they reject it, they will be left  without excuse in the day of the judgments of God Almighty, and if I were to fall in such a cause, I could fall in no better, and it would sweeten death to know that I had assisted in giving this great proclamation and invitation to the Gentile world, thereby fulfilling the commands of God and assisting to prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man and the Redemption of Man and Israel. truly there are solemn and important events approaching theis generation in which we live and "For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the light thereof go forth as brightness and their salvation as a lamp that burneth"  I think I can get the work published in Hebrew among the Jewes. I shall do what I can to spread it abroad.  You spoke of visiting this country. I shall be truly glad to see you at any time. I feel my labours and responsibilities very great at the present time. I rejoice that we share in your prayers and the prayers of all the Lord's anointed. Remember us to the Twelve and all who inquire after us. Mrs Woodruff wishes to be remembered to all.

I feel thankful that I have the privilege of gathering a few grapes after the vintage has done, while in New York on Sunday and Monday last I had an interview with a gentleman by the Name of Joseph Smith was intro- duced to him by Br Holister. He is a smart intelligent business man, is believing our doctrine and wishes to go to the valley and spend his days with the Saints, for He sees a storm coming, and knows of no other place of reffuge that He can get to but Zion, And this feeling is stealing owr some, and suddenly siezeing others of that part of mankind who reflect and begin to deeply feel this Eternal truth which is now revealing it self before their Eyes that their is sumthing awful about to burst upon the world which the Nations cannot Esscape and they feel they need some place in the Chambers of the rokcks to hide up in order to escape some terrible blow, and they can find No place suitable for the occasions ownly with the Mormons in the valley of the Mountains. My whole soul is on fire often when I reflect upon the state of Great Babylonn, and behold the saints which are appraching the Earth, and view the contrast of the scenes to be  Enacted in Zion and Gog, Egypt.

I consider that a sense of duty required me to lay before you certain things which have been a source of much grief and sorrow to me since my arrival in England. Some of the reasons why I have not before opened my mind to you upon the subject have been: that I have not wished to trouble your mind with any thing that I could get along without; and it has been much against my will to find fault with my bretheren; and lastly I have lived in hopes of arranging all matters in an amicable manner without calling your attention to the subject at all. But I have at last, come to the conclusion that you ought to know all; you will then understand my position and know how to to remember me before the Lord and perhaps you may be somewhat surprized at what I am about to reveal to you. At the Death of Joseph, you are well aware, there was a struggle for power among certain men in America. And you ^You have^ felt the weight of this Truth in Zion and so have I in Liverpool, far among men from whom I looked for better things viz: R. Hedlock and T. Ward.  There has been one evil in this church from the beginning. Give men a little extra power and influence for a season. when it is called for they are not willing to give it up or fill their own place and susttain men in their's. At last, I have found it so here. I will now give you a statement of facts as near as I can in truth since my arrival in Liverpool.  When I first landed I dis- covered a coldness and distance on the part of Elder Hedlock to- wards me, but much more so towards Brother Clark. After spending a few days in getting settled I began to make inquiry into the affairs of the office. Brother Hedlock said the account books were there I could examine them. The books not being kept in a systimatical order I could not readily comprehend things. I soon saw every exertion was made to prejudice my mind against Brother Clark. The Spirit against him was of such a nature that I saw he could never work with Brother Hedlock. In fact the accusations against him were of such a nature and urged so warmly I was obliged to make it almost my first business to trace up the accusations against him to the fountain head through all it's windings. It appeared to me to be like great groanings among the mountains to bringforth a mouse. it ended in this fact: he had kissed somebody. In my opinion it was more to keep him out of the Emigration business than to clear the church of crime. After I settled this up I advised him to take charge of some conference for a season until there was a better feeling at Liverpool.  I made my address to the churches through the Star and had my recommendation published with it that the Saints might know that I came with authority from the proper source.  I saw that Brothers Hedlock and Ward seemed to be much troubled about their standing so I made choice of them for councillors out of respect to the men and their former standing, thinking they would operate with me. There was nothing in the Star but that all was right. but the more I advanced towards my place as President to take charge of affairs and direct them, the more I found a spirit against it and secretiveness in all things especially with Bro. Hedlock; and Brother Ward had so much of John Bull in him, it seemed at times that it was of more consequence to him than the Priesthood. And as out of the heart the mouth speaketh I soon saw things in their hearts not right if I could judge from the course they were pursuing. their feelings were "We have power and influence and we will hold it." Brother Hedlock continues to carry on business his own way without consulting me in scarcely anything unless I dragged it out of him, and knowing it was my place and duty to understand what was going on I inquired into matters until in several instances he insulted me in the office and manifested much anger in the midst of considerable company, and as I would not quarrel with him, at least, in company, I quit the room. when he got mad he would say how much the Twelve were laying up from his labours and he ought to have his share of it as well as they. In several instances he threatened of leaving the office and going home at once. As he had threatened it so much I finally told him, I did not care how quick he went. "Yes" then says he "I know that is what you want, to get rid of me and get Brother Clark and you will do well enough." There has been so much of this spirit that there has been no union. I have been a speckled bird and stranger among them until it has caused me tears and sorrow by day and night. I have grown old under it. We have never bowed our knees together in prayer, but once, since we met, unless it has been in a conference. If men are not agreed how can they walk together. Had they have been an Enemy I could have met them but they were my counsellors, in one sense tried friends; men from whom I expected better things.

It Has caused our souls to rejoice not ownly in the  interest the presidency of the Church manifest for our welfare  but also of the Glad tidings and good report they bring of the universal prosperity and Blessings of God upon the Saints in the valleys of  the Mountains. I wish to say a few words concerning my present  condition and circumstances and the company with me I received  your letter of instructions while in the east concerning the gathering  of the Saints from the Eastern Lands. I laboured with all  disligence to carry out the instructions given me. It was a Barren field and like the gleaning of grapes after the vintage was done yet in my gleanings we Baptized about 800 and gathered  about 500 for the vally and the remainder who are in the faith  will leave the east for the valley next Spring. I started from  Philadelphia company  started a week before in consequence of freight Baggage andc we  Had to take slow trains or Emigrant trains which made it somewhe somewhat late in ariving at Kanesville. I sent two men early  in the season to St Louis with what means we could raise  to procure teams for our journey but Nothing ^was^ bought untill  my arival the great flood of gold emigration Had drained  the country of cattle and most of the emigrating Saints had  also bought before we purchased and it seemed almost imposs- ible to obtain teams at all, and we had to purchase mostly wild unbroke steers or old oxen, However through the Blessing  of God we were enabled to organize a company of over sixty  waggons and crossed the Mo River the 16th June the majority of which  were our Eastern Brethrn, but many Had to stop that expected to  come in consequence of the High price of oxen and the count of  Measures.

I had rather have favor with God Angels and the martered Saints, and my Brethern in the valley than to have all the Thrones and glories of the world combined in my possession, for they look to me at the present time like poor worthless rotten things ready to fall down There is nothing appears valuable to me but Mormonism for that Embraces all the substance and truth of Heaven and Earth, and I hate to leave off thinking, talking or writing about it, Still the things which move around us will attract our Notice for a moment, some have mattracted my attention for a few days past a little as I have been travelling, one or two of which I will mention. Wm Smith is figuring in these Eastern States of late to try to do sumthing but He cannnot acomplish it. G. J. Adams has again turned to what He calls righteousness joined the Temperanc Society and trying to raise up a Kingdom in Baltimore, and while on his way to Vorel to attend a conference called into my meeting on Sunday at New York the first time I have seen him since I came East. I paid no attention to him No more than if He had not been there He sat untill meeting was about closed and went quietly away without saying a word to anyone.

It is not because I have forgotten you or the family. I would like to come  and visit you and the family if I could in safety but our enemies are so diligent after me  and my Quorum that I have to withdraw from all of my family and entirely hide up in  the County. And I expect I shall soon have to leave this county or go into the hands of my enemies. My health is pretty good and my blank are good as far as the times will allow. This whole nation is persecuting us under the form of law. They will both mob and rob  us as far as the Lord will let them. The Nation would not persecute us if we were not  the true Church of Christ. It stands us all in hand to be true and faithful to our God, to our religion, and to our covenants. Give my Love to your Marion, Julia. I hope Ensign will attend school steady what time he has to go and improve his time and learn all he can for he will stand in need of it.

Any letters for me left with Brother Juques at  the office. He will send to me. I remain your Affectionate Father  W Woodruff  Private to yourself and Mother  Emeline  I have felt a good deal of anxiety about your Marriage with David Burrows. I have  been afraid you would throw yourself away. You are a good girl, a good Latter Day Saint and you are worthy of a good industrious, worthy man and a good Latter Day Saint. It looks as though he got baptized and attends meetings to get a wife. I don't want you to  take a step that you will regret afterwards. I want you to study well this matter and not  take a step that will cause you sorrow. Now Sylvia Woodruff has flung herself away by marrying Heber Thompson. He cannot provide her a home, food or raiment and she is  in poverty and affliction. I do not know what condition Br. Burrows is in to give you a home and make you comfortable, you should look into this before you marry. It is a  very important step to take in life. Your husband should be temperate, industrious and  moral and not addicted to any bad practices. Many has inherited sorrow by marriage, still marriage is honorable and it is right for girls to marry but they want to know who they are getting. I am anxious to have you do well.  Your affectionate Father  W. Woodruff  Emeline I want to give you a little advice about signing your name. It is not proper for any young lady to put Miss before her name. But whoever addresses you should write  Miss before your name. But the person writing should not put it to their own name.  You should write Emeline Woodruff and not Miss Emeline Woodruff. But it is proper  for anyone addressing you to write Miss Emeline. Try to remember this.

In speaking of the Emigration, Elder Hedlock has said it was a very bad plan to change names and whenever he did leave he could make me an agent to transact business in his name, as his name was now so universally known, he has taken no pains to acquaint me with the business or introduce me to any of the captains but generally if any come to do business, he would sooner walk away from me than acquaint me with what he was doing. We have rented a new respectable office for three years. he has rented it in his own name, he is also selling a part of it in his own name. In fact he does all business in his own name without any regard to me whatever as touching Emigration and Renting rooms, and one would think from his actions that he was laying a foundation to spend generations to come upon his own look in Liverpool. He has been to much expense this season in publishing large handbills and cards in his own name and scattered them all over the kingdom as a general shipping agent without consulting me at all upon these things. He is so secret in his movements and singular in his habits that neither myself nor any man about the office knows where he lives or boards, neither can I find out, though I have asked him several times. He counts it an insult to be asked the question He has kept the Temple Books until lately and signed all the re- ceipts in his own name. he has manifested a spirit to gain all the influence possisble. I had a plain talk with Elder Ward a short time since upon the subject, (as I had heard much testimony from others what they had said behind my back) I told Brother Ward I knew my place and my counsellors ought to know it also. I informed him they could not grease, soap or swallow me. that if they undertook to ride me they would find a hard seat before they got through. I told him that Brigham Young and not Reuben Hedlock was President of the church, and if Hedlock had power and influence the Presidency of the Church had given it to him, and if he were in the way of his duty he would throw that influence into the channel where it ought to be, for the stream had run out of the channel long enough. I told him it was time for me to have License for Emigration and for my name to appear upon the door post and sign boards, hand-bills and cards as well as R.  Hedlock's. Elder Hedlock had found fault because I had interfered with the Temple Books, but I have gone forward and taken them into my own possession and the Temple money also.  I gave Brother Ward to understand that I wanted my name to go as publisher of the Star, so it has found a place there; since I took a decided stand upon the subject they have yielded in a  degree, but I do not at the present time know the income and outgo of the emigration. Hedlock attends to that, keeps his own books he does not consult me upon the subject. if he converses on the subject it is to some one besides me. When I have conversed with him upon the subject, he has said when the debts he had contracted were paid he would give it up. He has also the Music Hall rented in his own name. I do not think myself that Bros Hedlock is a suitable person to conduct the Emigration here. I think he has charge of it as long as is for our good. I think he does not manifest the economy at all times that our circumstances require. There has been much said at times about how much he has paid out of his own pocket in carrying on business here, but he had nothing when he came, and all his generosity, freedom and expense have been at the expense of the office. They made a collection among all the churches a short time before I came, to pay the the debt for emigrating the poor, which they divided between them. I do not know what it amounted to, perhaps £50 or so. but I gave much offence because I inquired into it. In the midst of all this there are times when Brother Hedlock manifests a desire by words to do what good he can and help to roll on the work but he has a very strange way of showing it since I have been here. My arrival here was far from being welcome by those who were in the office at Liverpool. I was informed, Elder Hedlock said when he heard I was coming that I was a very tight pernicious, close man. Thomas Wilson, a man with them in the office said, if that were the case, I was not needed in England. There has been a spirit manifested here that they were afraid they would not get pay enough for what they did. Taking all these things into con- sideration I do not think things will go right until Brother Hedlock is called home, and transfers the business ^over^ into my hands. I shall then know what shape it is in, but if the way he is doing business so much out of sight was to be continued in the same way for five years, I would be as much in the dark about it at the end as I am now. I think if you should counsel him to come home and transfer all matters into my hands, that he would begin to think something about it. I do not wish you to let them know that I have made a communication of this kind to you for I think the easiest way to get along is for him to be counselled to come home. I have been in a trying place. he held the License for Emigration—the office and every thing in his own hands and name, and to undertake to fill my place by force, it appeared like making an explosion in the ENDENTRY without holding any meetings, or manifesting any interest in the work, for an example   I went to New Bedford whare they have upon their church Books about 100 members  I gave out an appointment but did not get a dozen together, And in the organiz- ation 25 names out of the 100 was given that might still be considerd as members of the Church. Salem, and other places, I might name. I can say however that I found the Majority of the branches organized, Holding meetings, And in some instances in better condition than I expected to find them considering the many isms that have been afloat And the little attention which the church has been Enabled to bestow upon them during their pilgraimage in the wilderness. (Philadelphia is in good condition. I had good meetings while there it is much the largest branch in the East the Number given me was 200 yet I do not think much more than one half that number Attend at any one time ie of Members of the church. I found New York without A presiding Elder I called  them to gather And Appointed Liverpool their presiding Elder. And since that they have been in better order than they have been before for several years according to their Numbers, which they gave as 65. I have kept A regular list of the number of each branch of the Church in the Eastern states as far as I could obtain it, Either by visit, letters, or the report of others; And the following is the result, which I think is correct in the Main and Embraces nearly all through- out the field of my labours, the greatest part of which I have visited.

They were once with us, professing to build up the Kingdom, of God. What are they now a set of poor mean miserable Devils As mean and miserable as the Devil can make then them, And If Brother Brigham and the rest of my Brethren will bear with me a moment and let me esxpress my feelings to you upon that subject a moment I will lay it before you in writing for I may as well write it as think it. it is this, I say in the Name of the Lord God of Israel that they shall be cursed from this time forth and shall not prosper, and to the full force of the ENDENTRY church, here; and to save the church (as it is not known abroad, only in Liverpool) I have borne many things that have been hard. They will neither of them attend meetings in Liverpool at all unless it is on some peculiar occasions. The American Elders see and understand these things and are with me in heart and spirit. These men that ought to have been my support have caused me much sorrow. In fact I have had no place or person with whom I could mingle my prayers before God only with my wife, or by chance meet an American Elder or some congenial spirit wandering to and fro. So if all things have not been conducted as you would wish in every respect, since I came here I trust you will make some allowance for my situation. I want the anointed of the Lord to remember me in their prayers that I may have power to fulfill my place and and station and overcome every ob- satcle, and I am resolved to wage a warfare with both men and devils in the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the Keys of the Kingdom of God until I can stand in the lot and station that the God and the President of the Church have appointed me. You know my nature make and spirit, that I cannot sit down and rest in peace if a work that I am appointed to do is not going right. No, I never was made to fold my arms at ease and sleep while Zion is travailing in pain to be delivered and while the God of Heaven is whispering to me by his Holy Spirit day and night, that His Judgments are speedily to be poured out upon this nation as well as America and that all the Gentile nations will follow in their train, and urging me to magnify my calling while the Day lasts lest blood be found in my skirts; and then when I meet my counsellors instead of bowing our knees together to call upon God, for my time to be spent in contending for my standing, rights and place at times, it makes me sick, at least, I partake of a portion of the same feeling that Joseph and Brigham is acquainted with at times when they have had to rise up and tell the people they are president, for the people don't seem to know it among so many presidents unless they occasionally tell them of it.  I think I have said enough on this subject. I have let out what was in my heart and I feel a good deal better. Any counsel you have to give me I will abide by it according to the best of my ability. When men undertake to pull me down ^here^ they try to pull you down, and when they pull you down they pull the Kingdom of God down; but thank God they cant come it. I know that God is with you and I know he is with me in this land, and I shall do what I can for the page torn cause. Though I have been telling a kind of sorrowful page torn tale page torn I am not discouraged. I am in good spirits. The Lord page torn on our page torn and some men will learn a lesson in days to come. I have no page torn disposition to injure Elder Ward. I wish them page torn well though they have not taken a wise course since I came. If Elder page torn Hedlock ever go home I think Elder Ward will work with me and hearken to my counsel. He is a very capable, useful, business man if he takes a right course. I have not brought up any of these things wishing to make an accusation or case of trial of them, but that you might know the truth of my circumstances and know how to pray for me. With regard to the Joint Stock Company, Elders Hedlock Ward and Wilson are the main officers in it at present. I think there was a Spirit manifested in some degree at it's organization against my being a director in it, but at that time I did not wish it and refused to have as I had so much on hand, but as most of the members and directors are members of the church I think they will hearken to our counsel upon the subject. I have tried in all my counsel and Teachings to impress upon the minds of all, the importance and necessity of walking by the counsel of the Presidency of the Church, and I think they will do it. They find it much more  expensive than they expected to get registered according to Act of Parliament and to get the Seal of State. It will cost over £100 (pounds).  Perhaps it is due Elders Hedlock and Ward to say that in the midst of all our affairs, there has been no spirit manifested by them that they wanted to apostatize and leave the church work. but to keep what power and influence they had and to get more, if even it was at my expense. They had been appointed Agents and presidents over the church and they could not get it into their heads that their presidency ceased when I came.  I have written a letter to you about the Bell. I hope I shall have an answer soon, for if the Bell be bought in America to save hso heavy duty as 30 per cent, I will im- mediately forward the money to you, so purchase it, the first safe opportunity. All things are going on quite as well through all the Conferences as I could expect, and I shall look for a harvest as soon as we get assistance from Nauvoo for it will be of the right stamp.

Firstly, while perusing the sacred volumn of inspiration I find many wonderful works were performed by our Saveiour, and likewise by the apostles though not by their own power, but by faith in and through Jesus Christ and if I mistake not when Christ first sent his disciples to preach the gospel which was to the lost sheep of the house of isreal he commanded them to heal the sick cleans the lepers rase the dead cast out devils andc. ##Matthew 10|S. Mathew chap. X.## again in the last chapter of ##Mark 16|S. Mark## Christ appeared to  the brethren as they sat at meat and gave them a vary forcible command to go into all the world and preach the gospel to ev^e^ry creature he that  believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover, andc this apparently was the last command given by our Saviour before he assended to heaven. now the question that arises in my mind is when and whare were those gifts done away as some maintain that they are. I find no scriptures satisfactory to prove that they ever were done away theirfore I am led to believe that God is the same to day as in ancient days and likewise should people at this day like as did the apostles and exercise the faith that did Isaac that those gifts might again be on the earth and in case of sickness we might  loock to the Lord for deliverance in prefference of trusting to an arm of  flesh. we read of a fwoman that was ill that had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse which was finally healed by her faith in Christ. should light be held up to the world uppon this subject at the preasent  day undouptedly their would be as little heed given to it as the Lord told Ezekial their would be to his prophecy when he sent him to the house of israel, yet I ask your opinion uppon the subject for information  (the Lord sent Ezekiel to prophecy nowithstanding they would not hear  and ought not light uppon this subject be held up even if it is not received) ENDENTRY Beginning halfway down the page  A copy of a Letter sent to Mrs Horner Oct 30, 1853  Great Salt Lake City Oct 30, 1853  Mrs Hornor  I take the Liberty of addressing a few lines to you and of asking a few qustions which you will do me a great favor by Answering the Next Mail so that I may get some information upon a subject in which I am much interested I sent by Brother Horner one year ago this fall $1552.40 in United States Gold to be forwarded on his arrival in the States to Portland Maine they have Never received any of that Money nor heard any thing from it on from Brother Horner up to the 5th Sept which Letter I got this Mail.

Brother Haven is expecting to lead up a company from Boston At the opening of navigation. Since I have been on my Eastern Mission, while meeting with the saints, And teaching them the first Principles of the gospel, the Epistle of the Twelve, their gathering and building up Zion, the signs of the, times. the gathering of the Jews, And the certain judgments of  God which Await the Nations of the Earth (And further than this your servant has neither  taught nor practiced) I have been filled from time to time with the spirit of God And a deep sense of the awful judgments of A Justly Angry God which stands like a storm already gatherd And ready to burst upon the Nations of the Earth Esspecially this Nation. And I feel to offer up the gratitude of my heart to my Heavenly Father for his blessing to me thus far on my mission. Elders Carter, Appleby have been labouring more or less during the past summer and winter in these Eastern States. And they almost universally make one report ie they cannot get access to the hearts of the people, can not get them out to hear, And if they do get a congregation together the word is like throwing A Ball against A rock, it bounds back, or like pouring water onto a gooses back it runs off, And does not pene- trate. they cannot get their bread among them, or means to travel, but have to call upon the churches in order to live. I have generally found the same indifference manifest  by the world whare I have travelled, but few come out to hear and but few have been Baptized. I baptized 3 in New Haven, Br Rockwood 3, And Brother Appleby several in Philadelphia, and Cream Ridge, and several Baptized in other parts. I gave Elder Appleby council to visit the Saints in Pennsylvania and New Jersey from time to time as he had An opportunity And preach as doors were open. The question might be asked by some why are the people of this Nation so indifferent about hearing or Embracing the gospel while the work is rolling like fire in dry stubble in other Nations. I view this Nation in as bad a state at least as the Jews were After puting the saints And Jesus to death, their day of visitation in a great measure had past. This Nation in like manner have stoned And killed the Prophets, shed the Blood of the Lords anointed, rejected the gospel, And driven the entire Church And Kingdom of God with those bearing the oricles there of into the Mountains of Israel, who before taking their departure with uplifted hand's to Heaven in the Temple of the Lord, Justly cut off the Nation from the Church And Kindgdom of God, for their Abominations, wickedness And Bloody, deeds. In Addition to this since that period, the sins of this Nation have Apparently increased fourfold commencing with the sin of sodomy adding Every other named in the black catalogue of crime, untill it is like A flood that overflows its banks, And it seams as though not ownly the Holy Ghost but that portion of the spirit of God that was given to Enlighten every man that came into the world was taken its departure from the people, And they are going like the ox to the slaughter and know not the Approach of their destruction ENDENTRY one two or three days in advance of us Heywood and HEdward Hunter are from 1 to 4 days in the Rear However Elder Stratton will give an account of them.

ENDENTRY secondly, with respect to the sabbath we allmost universally Regard the first day of the week as the sabbath, but when God appeared to mount he commanded him to keep the seventh day as the sabbath and not to labour on that day, so it appears that if their has not been a change of the sabbath we as a bobdy are not keeping the day that we were commanded to keep, still ist is held up to view at this day that the sabbath has been changed, but is it not allowed that there has not been no change in any of these commands that were given to Moses at the time that the command of the Sabbath was given and why has the sabbath been changed while the other commands remain good and sacred and while we are under them and ought to obey them ##Exodus 20:8-11## it is maintained ^by some^ that Christ rose on the first day of the week and that the work of Redemption was greater than the work of creation and this they appear to consider as the change of the sabbath, but when we carefully peruse the writings of the four Evangelist respecting the resurection of Christ does it not appear as reasonable to suppose that Christ rose on the seventh day as first, and even did Christ really rise on the first day of the week, does that prove that it was a change of the sabbath and if the sabbath was changed by the resurrection of Christ would their not have been sumthing said respecting that change so that the  evidence would have been clear that the change of the sabbath was then perfected. Sir this is a subject that has some length of time ocipied a seat in my mind and I lay it before you considering you have far deeper understanding of the word of God than myself and would wish to know your views uppon this subject as I have not understood the scriptures to be varry plain respecting the change of the Sabbath.  the third and last is the subject of babtism and ist is a subject to that has long lain with wait weight on my mind I think it not ownly our duty but our highest privledge to take the word of God and make it the man of our council and form our principles theirby still we may benifit by the instruction of those that are more experienced than ourselves I for one fconsider myself transacting business for Eternity and I believe that Jesus Christ set the example for the pilgraim to follow and I believe that the christian ought to strive to imitate his example as near as possible (allthough I for one come far short of it) I at times have been allmost overwhelmed in as^s^tonishment while meditating uppon the differences of opinion and principle that exist in our land uppon religious subjects when we have all the same bible to read the same spirit to direct but more especially uppon the subject of babtism, my mind has long been illegible with regard to this subject still I have remained silent uppon the subject as I am of the opinion that every person ought to be fully established uppon ^in^ principles uppon which much depends I had the ordanence of infant babtism administered to me but it does not answer my mind for I have not found any scripture to support it from revelation ENDENTRY Mr Geo A Smith  sideways text December 12th 1850  From  W.

He said he had no means with him ownly enough to help him home; but He would consider the subject. He laid his circumstances before me, And Asked some council. I Advised him to follow the council of the Epistle; He said He would do it. He had the keels of three vessels laid, said He would finish them; And lay no more, but sell to the best Advantage, He codd could and go to the valley. I found him strong in the faith. I recieved A letter from him A short time since.

But after obtaining all the facts I could in relation to the subject; I did not feel to condemn him, but to sustain him: for if their was A fault at all in his doing to much it was one that men are so seldom guilty  of, that it was As good A subject for the cloke of charity as I could find. It is true he had given to the full Extent of his means: And sometimes upon the exercise of his faith, in all cases, where calls had been made upon him bearing the signiture of the Presidency and seal of the church: yet he had contracted no debt ownly in full faith of meeting the demand. He began with nothing, had no capital yet his labour and business was lucrative. I do not know the exact amount of his dona- tions; But I suppose som $3000 in all since He came Here. He assisted Br Benson in means to help buy a mill, He bought the standard. Paid (I think) for the Press and $100 worth of type for W. W.

He a appears to me to be a gentleman. I think it will be well to keep upon good terms with him as far as possible.  I would life like to have Emigration continue as fast as doors are open either by sea or lands, but I think it right for us to see our way vlear clear in chartering ships. by getting subscriptions among the Saints for that purpose before running any risks, that would be detrimential to the course and a disadvantage to the Church. I like the spirit manifested by Mr. Benson with my interview with him yesterday. And as far as you can, do business with him as cheap as elsewhere. I would prefer to continue business with him, as he appaarently manifests much interest in our welfare. I hope the Lord will open your way to get a goodly number out by fall if not before. Bro. Appleby has left the business entirely in regards to chartering a vessel in your hands and is going out with a company by lands.  My respects to Sister Little and all the Saints.

ENDENTRY and if I may be allowed to use the expression it has been a mystery to me how so many great divines that have been so long holding  up the light of the gospel and still sometime in so gross an error with respect to babtism, for if I am not greatly mistaken I find no account of John or any of the apostles administering the ordinance of babtism untill they become believers in Christ or at least untill they considered them true believers and that appeared to be all that was required of them in order to be babtized was to believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God and if they spiritually believed this they must be penitent believing and respecting the mode of babtism it appears plain to me that their is no room for one a moment to doubt but that our Saviour was buried in babtism in the river Jordan and that all that the Apostles babtized were buried with Christ in babtism and setting aside evry other example but the one that Christ left us that alone aught to be sufficient to convince mankind that emmersion was the rite and ownly mode  of babtism (to use the language of Dr. Daddridge Jesus had no sin to  wash away and yet he was babtized and God owned this ordinance so far as to make it a season of pouring forth the spirit uppon him and this ought to silence evry objection to the practice.  many advance the argument that those things are not escential but may we not with the same propriety say that when Isaac that it was not esesntial whether he offered his son or a lamb out of his flock and who of decided virtue will admit that the Lord would have received Abraham offering with a blessing and given a blessing in  return had he offered a lamb in stead of his son, and why should any believe  that infant sprinkling will be as acceptable in the sight of God for babtism as to follow the example that our Saviour hath given has not Christ plainly told us that he is the way ^the truth life^ and if mankind ever  enter in to the kingdom of heaven must it not be by him isf so then ought we not to obey his commands and follow his precepts  and not climb up some other way.  Mr. Phippen as I am convinced of the mode of baptism, and believe it to be essential to my prosperity and happiness the information that I wish you to communicate to me respecting this subject is whether it is against your principle and discipline to administer the ordinance of babtism to those that you consider to be proper subjects without joining the Church for I at present am not prepared to unite ^join^ with any Church still I feel it a duty to be babtized and would wish to take up the cross when I have a fair opportunity I have premeditated a conversation with you uppon this subject but have delayed it as my brother is expecting to be babtized and I have rather been waiting for him.

What I mean by the main channel lying before me is I know I was not sent to this country to gather the Saints to the gold digings of the valley of the Sacramanto. And Brother Badlam is the ownly individual who has had my council to go thare. And the reasons I ^have^ given. My council has been invariably to all the Saints to go to the valley of the Salt Lake via Samuel Brannan, And all other men that have reflected at all upon the subject, can now see ("without looking through A glass darkly") the wisdom of God in leading his servants the to the valley of the Salt lake to prepare A place for the gathering of the saints instead of the valley of the Sacramanto: for it appears to me from the signs of the time that this church a year hence would have as much peace, quietness, or elbow room, in Hell, or the City of New York, as they would in the valley of the Sacramanto. When I have reflected upon this subject in connexion with the present universal commotion of the whole Earth. And read the Account of your safe arival in the valley, And the camp of Israel with you; And the crops, productions, and blessings of the valley: I have felt like shouting Hosannah—xx to God And the Lamb, and to Praise the God of Israel that he has led his people safely through the wilderness in the last days, And given them A quiet resting place in the rich valleys of Ephraim, in the mountains of Israel. I have also rejoiced much in the accounts recieved by the stars, And letters of the progress of the work throughout the British Isles under the labours of Elders, Jones And scores of Elders in that land, it indeed seams to be their day of visitation And the Elders are in A rich harvest of wheat, And reaping day and night. But you will get all accounts from that quarter by the Star; Elder Spencer, and those who came from that Land. Elder Boston is now preparing to join the spring Emegration to the valley.

They had been to the Verdie, baptizing some and administering to the sick. Brother Lake has been looked upon as dangerous, but was some better yesterday.  In my short communication of the 2nd inst., I promised to give a more full account of my visit to the Islatus, which I will now en- deavor to do. I view my visit amontg the Nephites one of the most interesting missions of my life, although short. I say Nephites, be- cause if there are any Nephites on this continent we have found them among the Zunies, Lagoonies and Islatus, for they are a different race of people altogether from the Lamanites. I class the Navajoe, Moquie and Apaches with the Lamantiites, although they are in advance of many Indian tribes of America. I class the Zunies, Lagoonies and Islatus among the Nephites. (See Sec. 3, 17 verse, D. and C.). The Zunies are in advance of the Navajoes, Apaches, or any other Laman- ites. The Lagoonies are much above the Zunies, and the Islatus are far above them all in wealth, in beauty, cleanliness and order of their homes and persons, the adornment of their dwellings, their in- dustry and indefatigable labors, the virtue and purity of their na- tiojnal blood, their bearing and dignity in their intercourse with strangers and, above all else, the expansion of their minds and cap- ability of receiving any principle of the Gospel, lof endowments or sealing powers, fully equal to the mind of any of the Anglo Saxon ENDENTRY those Settlements to the Bishop, as their is  no other Grist Mill in 100 Miles of our  settlements it leaves the tithing wheat 50  75 or more miles from the Mill and as they are in a New County No conveniences  for storeing tithing grain.

In my former letters I stated the opinion of the brethren that the company from Farmington could come to Arizona better in Febuary and March, but the times admonish us that nobody can come in the winter at all. They will be under the necessity of waiting untill spring untill the grass grows, before which time niether teams nor stock can travel.

An Excellent work in the Temple is still kept up, the Brethren and sisters are well united who labor there, there were over 100 Endowtments given daily a portion of the time I was there.

On that Evening there arived in St Geoge Marshall Stokes, the Marshall from the Reef, and several other strangers, all of them on urgent and important Business of course, and among other things was vary anxious to have an interview with me, but as I could not learn that they had any Recommds to the Temple I did not feel disposed to interview them, And after I had spent two nights in the Temple and the Marshalls Enquiring of the boys in the street if they knew where a certain man  was and to top off with, after an aged Brother of great Experience from the North country prayed Earnestly in a public Meeting of Saints and Sinners friends and foes, that the Lord would preserve Brothr So and So calling him by name from the U.

ENDENTRY them untill sumthing better can be advised I have spent more time at Sunset than either  of the other settlemts. I can speak more advisedly  than of the others. I think Sunset has proved  itself a success in a tempory as well as spiritual  point of view. Brother Lot Smith who is the  presidet of the stake, takes the lead in the work  does as much hard work as any man in the Branch  faires No better than the poorest, and I think  has produced a good deal more for the support  of the people than any settlemt in the Mountains according to the Number Employed. They as did Brigham  City lost hundreds of bushels of wheat by the  flood last year, yet almost Evry Mormon  Settlemet in Arizona have Depended upon  Lot Smith for their bread for the last  six months before harvest. He has distributed  to the Saints during the year I think from 15 to  20 Tons of flour and meal. and done it freely. and  when I left Sunset on the 29 July Br Lot Smith  had but 150 Acres of good ripe plump wheat  which I think I am safe in saying that it would  20 bushels to the Acre, and had 55 Acres more to  cut the latest they had and the best, that will  yield 40 bushels to the Acre, total of the wheat  crop 5200 Bushels And he  has but 11 Men and  boys at work on the farm, and he has over 100 Acres  of corn looks well, 30 of cane, 20 of Lucern and  some 15 Beets carrots and other vegitables, all his  other Men are at work at the waggon, Blacksmiths sheep Heard, Steam Saw Mill, and Dairy quite a  settlement at the Mill and Dairy. The crops at Brigham  City are not near as good but what they have are in the ben. They have cut their Early ^Sonora^ Sonora  wheat at St Joseph, rather light 15 bushels to the  Acre, later wheat Better, their corn and Garden  very good. Wheat at Snow Flake half cut  a fair crop. corn and vegitables at Sholo Creek  Read Head and Easts very good, corn and potatoes at  Father Cluffs looks well. corn and vegitables  at Forest Dale half a crop.

Some of the  Bishops offered me thithing Money I told them  to Deliver it to the presidents of the Stakes  who should forward it to the Trustee  the earliest opportunity, if I was going to  Salt Lake direct, I would take any tithing  Money and Deliver it to the proper proper  Authority on My arival as I at times  have done.

There is another thing I wish  to say Lot Smith has loaned a good  Deal of flour or grains to people through  Arizona during the past year to feed them  they were to return this back to the Mill  The Trustee probably not understanding the  situation I understand has given the people  the privilege of turning in their wheat in   ENDENTRY mexican brother has baptized 5 of them and a prospect of more. I think there is a fair  prospect of an effectual door opening in Arizona to bring many of the Mexicans pop- ulation into the Church. They are of coarse a  good deal mixed with the Indian blood.  We recieved a letter to-day from brother Haskel He had arrived safe at San Juan after en- countering huricanes and snow storms. He found only 2 men and 3 women and 8 child- ren in the settlement, and they had a fright from a report that the Utes was coming to destroy all on the river, but they did not do  it. Soon 3 men arrived from Silas Smiths Company. they were still hemmed up and could not travel, no road, had to blast thier way with powder of which they were out. They said it would take 300 lbs. more powder to blow them into the river and out again and Silas Smith had gone back to obtain the powder to accomplish it. It seems quite a mistake for companies to undertake to travel a road with women and children in the winter, that has not been explored. I think we should avoid a repetition of it. I have heard the new boat  was in the river at Lee's Ferry. I am glad to hear it. I wish president Taylor and Council would change the name of that ferry. I do not like the name. If it was changed perhaps there might not be as many Ghosts visit it and scare the women as there has  been in days that are past. There has been strange stories told by the sisters who have been to work there. We are beginning to have cold weather in Arizona of late. Thermom- eter has been showing for several mornings past from zero to 6 degrees below which is  an uncommon thing for this country. I expect Sunset people will finish threshing tomorrow. Head to go to Snowflake and borrow thier machine as the Clawson ma- chine refuses to do any more threshing this season. They will have about 3200 bushels, which is less than what I expected, yet 2/3 of all the Mormons of Arizona are looking to these figures for thier years bread. It should read 13000 in order to feed them untill harvest. But Sunset are doing all they can for the needy.

While I have been standing in the midst of that noble minded people, teaching them the Gospel, I could not make myself believe I was standing in the presence of American Indians or Lamanites, neither was I. The Islatus of which I speak is a village twelve miles be- low Rio Del Norte, containing 3000 souls that stand at the head of this class of men that I calol the Nephites. They occupy forty villages, containing a population of 32,000, speak- ing sixteen distinct languages, but nearly all good Spanish scholars. I look upon this as a great field of missionary labor for some forty good, faithful "Mormon" Elders, who should be able to speak the Spanish, and I hope next Conference will call some of them, at least, into the field. I visited this people, located in their homes, in company with Brother Ammon M. Tenney, who had visited most of them before and I think has done much good in opening doors among them. He had baptized 115 of the Zunies on a former mission. My journey and visit with him was a visit of observation and I was amply paid. In what way, I do not know, but in almost ebvery village I visited, they were looking for me. I can only make a brief outline from my  journal of our journey. On the 19th of Auguast, we entered the Zunie village, containing about 3000 souls. The village stood on a piece of ground; many buildings three stories high, the upper stories en- tered by ladders at the top. There had been a heavy struggle in this village between the Catholics and Mormon Zunies. The priests had done all they could to lie about the Mormons and had drawn away a few who had been baptized, but others remained firm. I went through the old Catholic cathedral in the village; it looked as though it were 500 years old. It had two bells hanging in the tower and over the pulpit was some of the finest carved work in wood I ENDENTRY here and a flood the Little Colorado  ^was^ two miles wide but done No damage  here wheat all in the slioh silo at Sunset and 2000 shucks of corn above high water mark and 20 acres of cane made up, ownly they got wet was 5 acres of squashes, but they are now being Gathered Brothe Jaques says that Earnest Young was picked up Drunk in the  street and found Dead in the morning. if  it was lawful for a man to give utterance to his thoughts I would say it was a good thing, and would be if a few more would follow suit Salt Lake City would be  better off.
