 was again taken with another writ and was to be tried in Illinois. On this night Brigham Young also dreamt that we were called home.At Cincinnati I shipped 30 reams of paper for the Times and Seasons and we spent the interval to the 22nd in visiting the Saints and Branches near; and thenleft for Pittsburg on board the Adelade for Pittsburg where we arrived on the 27th at 6 o'clock p.m.There was a meeting that night in the city at the Temperance Hall to which we repaired and about the first persons we saw were Elders H. C Kimballand Orson Pratt. We heard the voice of John E. Page preaching as we entered. He hammered the sectsduring his discourse and at the close he informed the people of our arrival which made six of the ^Twelve^ in the city.Next day our quorum held a council and Brigham its president enquired concerning the proceedings of the Twelve at Cincinnati, and found that elders Kimball O. Pratt and John E. Page held a conference and organized the Church there and their Elders Pratt and Kimball left for Pittsburgh but Elder Page stayed behind & in a few days disunited what he been done and reorganized the ChurchPresident Young reproved John E. Page for undoing what three of the quorum of the Twelve had done together and spoke also of Joseph's counselto be gentle and mild in our teachings and not to battle with the sects but win the affections of the people.Pittsburgh resembled the English cities in consequence of the burning of so much stone coal which covered the ^city with the^ the dustiness of the smokeIts population was about 35,000 it had 120 preachers95 churches and 21 denominations and the Branchthe Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints numbered seventy-five souls. 
 Sunday the 30th six of the quorum of the Twelve met at Temperance Hall in Pittsburgh with the SaintsIn the morning I addressed the meeting followed by G. A Smith; in the afternoon John E. Page and OrsonPratt, and in the evening H. C. Kimball followed by Brigham Young.ItemsfromBrigham Young's RemarksAmong many other things he said"Why do the people oppose the gifts and graces?If a man can get faith by the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost so as to lay hands upon his wife and children or friends when they lie sick and languishing nigh unto death and command the fever or disease or even death itself to depart and the person is releived I ask what harm is there in all this?Or if a man by faith and humility before God can get the testimony of Jesus and prophesy of things to come or speak in tongues or cast out devils I ask what harm in all this?Does it do any harm? No it does not.I know the New Testament is true; for I have proved it according to the pattern given by beleiving in Christ obeying the Gospel and knowing the signs do follow. Then I ask do these thingsharm any one? No they do not."In speaking of the Kingdom of God he said"The Kingdom must be together; the people must be gathered into 
 one place. For how would the King of France or Englandsucceed in undertaking to reign over a Kingdom when the people were scattered all over the world except in Franceor England. They could not reign over a people unless the people were with those kings to reign overSo with the Saints. They must be gathered together and this work has already commenced And who is the author of this work and gathering?Joseph Smith the Prophet as an instrument in the hands of God is the Author of it. He is the greatestman on earth. No other man of this age has power to assemble such a great people from all the nations of the earth with all their varied dispositionsand assimulate them and cement them togetherso that they might be subject to rule and order This the Prophet is doing; and that which makes a great king president or man is to have a great people to rule over."Next day our quorum assembled and took a tour through the city. We visited Curling'sGlass Works and saw them work through each branch of the manufacture; we then went to the bluff above the city and had a view of the new Basin to be filled with water forced from the Alleghaney River to supply the city below of which we had a fair view.Descending the hill we had a view of the city water works. The building was after the Roman order cost two hundred thousand dollars and was designed and executed by Elder Charles Becka member of the Church of Latter-day SaintsAfterwards we visited Miltonburgers Ironworks through each of its branches and saw the keel laid for an iron steam ship of war. The keel was140 ft. in length 
 Elder Charles Beck paid 48 dollars for stage fare of six of the Twelve to Baltimore and a collection was taken up of about 20 dollars to assist us to Philadelphia at which place we arrived on the 5th of August. having left Pittsburghon the 3rd.On the ^Sunday^ afternoon of the 6th which was Sunday we met in the Canaanite Church about 300 Saints. Elder Grant opened the meeting and ^which^ President Brigham Young addressed themeeting at considerable length. Among other things he said"A man or a woman may ask of God and get a witness and testimony from [word erased] concerning any work or messenger sent unto them; but if a person asks for a thing that does not concern him such as governing the Church &c he will not get an answer and if he does it will not be from God"He also remarked in conversationupon the enquiry of, Who had the ^fulness of the^ MelchisidecPriesthood that if any in the Church had it he did not know it. For a person to have ^the fulness of^ that Priesthood he must be a King and a Priest. A person ^He^ might have a portion of ^it^ that Priesthood the same as the governors or Judges of England have power from the King to transact business but he is ^they are^ not the King of England. A person may be anointed King and Priest before he receives his Kingdom &c.In the evening Orson Prattpreached, followed by remarks from George A Smith. One the morning of this Sabath I went with Elder Young and others to a Millerite Meeting. Here we heard a Mr Litz preach a sermon destroying the literal return of the Jews and rebuilding of Jerusalem 
 Two days afterwards the Twelve and about 150 Saints took an excursion on board a steamer As we glided over the water we passed the new frigate Rariton of sixty four guns and reached Gloster Pointwere we spent the day in feasting fishing swingingwalking singing and discussing various subjectsOne of the subjects which arose for discussion was, "Is the prosperity of any religious denomination a positive evidence that they are right?"Elder John E. Page contended for the affirmative and Elder J. M. Grant for the negative Brigham Young the chairman decided that theprosperity of any people was no positive evidence of their being right.We returned to the city and during the evening my mind was deeply exercised with the impression that my wife was in distress or afflicted. I prayed for her before the Lord and my mind was releivedDuring the week we held meetings several times and visited public places.On one of the days Elders Young O Pratt G. A Smith myself and P. Hesse visited the State House, and on the top of the steeple we had a fine view of the city of PhiladelphiaDescending to the Indipendance Hall we saw the place where the Patriots signed the Declaration and sat in the chair in which John Hancocksat in at the time he signed that instrumentNext day we visited various parts of the city especially Peel's Museum where among many other things of note we saw and examined the body of the Mermaid and the skeleton of a MamouthOn the 14th I parted from the Philadelphia Saints and in company with Elders Orson Pratt and Wm Moor took steamboat to Skoolkill and then walked 6 miles to Mr. Mosley's and preached in the evening followed by O. Pratt 
 We journeyed 27 miles the next day and during our days ride we passed over the ground of the Brandywine Battle saw where the action commenced w[h]ere the Americans retreated and a part of them surrendered and saw also where Washington led away the remainder of the armyThe day after Elder Moor and myself travelled 25 miles to brother John Neffs in Strasburgh and found him disposed to sell his property and go to Nauvoo and take stock in the Nauvoo House or Temple On the way we passed by Bishop Edward Hunter's former residence and foundthe country throughout this region exceedingly rich and fertileWe continued our journey on the succeeding day to West Nantmeal and on the next in the evening met with Elder Pratt and others and held meeting at West NantmealSeminary and the day after commenced a two days meeting 12 miles distant in a grove in Uwchland TownshipThe second day of our camp meeting was Sunday August 20th. A good congregation came together and I addressed them in the forepart of the day from the text "If our Gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost" &c. [##2 Corinthians 4:3##]In the afternoon Elder O Pratt delivered a powerful discourse from ##Revelation 22:3|Revelations 22 ch 3rd verse## "And there shall be no more curse.["] He began with the fall and traced his subject through to the Millennium the Second Advent the binding of Satan and the New heaven and the New earth when Christ shall deliver the Kingdom up unto his Father and the last enemy Death be destroyed.Next day we returned by rail to Philadelphia where we met Elder Grant 
 but found that the rest of the Twelve had left the city for New York where we followed them two days later.Conference at New YorkheldAugust 26, 1843.The quorum of the Twelve met the Saints in Conference at New York on this dayAfter prayer President Young opened the buisness of the Conference by an interesting addressupon the subject of the gathering, the Priesthood and the building of the Temple and Nauvoo House.In the afternoon Elder Kimballspoke very graphically in parables; and Elder GeorgeA. Smith followed with anecdotes. One related to his collegiate education received from the Prophet which was to preach short sermons and make short prayersRemarks of President Brigham YoungElder Young next spoke; and among other remarks he said"The Scriptures have been mistified to that degree that the greatest divine of the day is as ignorant as the dumb ass concerning the things of God. They know not their right hand from their left and we are trying to reverse it by making the things of God so simple that the people can understandPlace a man in this room who is ignorant of science and take everything out that we can see and then ask him if there is anything in the room. He will say no nothing but us two. I tell him there are millions of liveanimals in the room and that even we breathe them 
 and I will show him by the aid of the mthat there are live animals in one drop of water eight feet long but he will not beleive me until he sees it through the magnifying glass.So with the unbeleiver. He does not beleived in God in angels in spiritsbecause he does not see them but let him have spiritual glasses or let him obey the commandments of God and get the Spirit of God and then he can see."The following was also givenInteresting Questions & Answers1st. Ques. Can any oficer in a Branch of the Church say his word is law and should be obeyed?Ans.: No.Ques. Is it right for a Priest to be joined to a Teacher in visiting the houses of the members when their duty is set forth in the Book of Doctrines & Covenants?Ans.: Yes any officer from an High Priest to a Deacon may visit the Church and be set apart for this purpose.Ques.: If Elders or High Priests are on an Island and cannot get word from the Prophet or the Twelve may they get revelations concerning themselves?Ans.: The Twelve may get a revelation concerning themselves. They may get a revelation in any part of the world concerning the building up of the Kingdom as they have to establish the Kingdom in all parts of the world. So any person can ask the Lord for a witness concerning himself. He can obtain an answer for 
 himself but not to lead the Church. That belongs to the head of the Church."Ques.: Can a Church make by laws as an expediency for themselves which are not specified in any revelationAns.: Yes if they wish they may makelaws to stick their fingers in their eyes.Ques.: When any person is ordained legally by vote of the Church to any office can he be released from that office and Priesthood and hold his standing in the ChurchAns.: No.On the following day Conference was continued. Meeting was opened by singing and prayer by Elder Grant after which Elder Woodruffdelivered a discourse from the ##2 Peter 1:20-21|2nd Epistle of Peter1st ch., & 20, 21 verses##.Elder Kimball followed with some appropriate remarks and in the afternoon John E. Page gave a lengthy discourse proving the divine mission of Joseph Smith and the truth of the Book of Mormon.In the evening Elder O. Prattdelibered a masterly discourse upon the Book of Mormon. He said it was the history of nearly one half of the Globe and of the people who had inhabited it that it gave the history of all the cities which had since it came forth been discovered by Cartherwood and Stephens that it spoke of the establishing of our government and what is more highly interesting it reveals its final fate and destiny so that by reading the Book of Mormon it may be clearly seen what will befall this nation and what will be its final end. In that Book is also the Gospel as taught by Jesus Christ himself to the ancient inhabitants of America and an account 
 of his ministry amongst them after his resurrectionand Assension. This was the pith of his discourse occupying nearly two hours.I left New York on the 29th in company with Elders Davis and Wandell and having visited Branches on my road I arrived at Farmingtonmy native place on the 2nd of September and left my fathers house again on the 5th and on the 8th arrived at the city of Boston where I found Elder George A Smith and another brother waiting for me at the station.Conference held by The Quorum of the Twelveatat Boston in Boylston HallSep. 9th, 1843.There were present of the quorum of the TwelveBrigham Young Heber C. Kimball Parley P. PrattOrson Pratt John E. Page Willford Woodruffand George A. SmithElder G. A. Smith opened the Conference by prayer and then President Youngcalled for the business of the meeting after which the churches were representedDuring this conference there were discourses delivered by all the members of the quorum of the Twelve present their subjectsbeing chiefly upon the gathering building the Templeand kindred matters. It would be too lengthy to give the synopsis of the whole of them as recorded in my daily Journal of the time. The substance of several must suffice. 
 Parley P. P. Pratt led the van upon the Gathering and then President Brigham Young further laid before the Conference the subject and design of this mission of the Twelve to the eastern churches.Synopsisof the Discourse of President Brigham YoungI wish to make a few remarks concerning the subject of our faith. We hear the Elders represent the feelings of the brethren concerning the gatheringThe Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ is a gathering Spirit. Its tendency is to gather the virtuous and good the honest and meek of the earth in fine the Saints of God.The time has come when the virtuous and ^Lord has^ determined to fulfill his purposes "Had we lived in the days of Christ," the people say, we would have received his work. But judgeye if the people are better now than they were then. They are not.When the full set time was come the Lord came in the flesh to do his work whether the people were prepared or not. And nowthe full set time is come for the Lord God Almighty to set his hand to redeem IsraelWe are not bound to make the people beleive but to preach the Gospel and then our garments are clear.The Lord does not require every soul to leave his home as soon as he beleives but he requires him to hearken to counsel and follow that course which the Lord points outThe Spirit of the Almighty andof this work is on the elect ^alert^ and those who keep 
 up with the work must be on the alert alsoWhen the Lord says gather yourselves together why do you ask Him, what for? Is it not the principle of the Saints to mingle together to promote the great cause in which we are engaged?Do you say, cannot the Lord save us as well where we are as to^when^ gathered together?Yes if the Lord says so but if he commands us to come out and gather together He will not save us by ^our^ staying at home. Have you not received the Gospel? Yes. Then do you beleive what we say. Have you not received the Holy Ghost by receiving the Gospel which we have brought unto you? Yes; andthousands have and it stands as a testimony that God has a Prophet upon the earthYou might have been baptized seventy times seven in any way except the one God ordained and pointed out and you would not have received the Holy Ghost. This also is a testimony to you.Are you engaged in the great work with us? You will say Yes. Can you do any good? you ^You can^ The sectarian world send the Bible to the nations of the earth. The people put in sixpence fifty cents or a dollar into the box and send Bibles through the world. Then cannot you do something? Yes.The Lord requires us to build a house unto His name that the ordinances and blessings of his Kingdom might be revealed and that the Elders may be endowed to go forth and gather together the b[l]ood of Ephraim the people of God from the ends of the earthCan you get an endowment in Boston? No. And only in that place which God has appointed. 
 Now query: Could Moses have got the law had he remained in the midst of the children of Israel and not gone into the mountain? The Lord said Go and do so and so. Stand before Pharoah. Pull off your shoes for the ground is holy &c. [##Exodus 3:5##] Moses obeyed and obtained the blessing; but if he had not obeyed he would not have obtained the blessing.But why query about it at all? Has the Lord spoken? Yes. Then that is enough. I do not care whether the people gather or not. If they don't want to I do not wish to save the people against their will. I wish you to have your choice either to gather with the righteous or stay with the wicked. I would like to have all people bow down to the Lord Jesus Christ but it is one of the decrees of the Lord that all persons shall act upon their agency which was the case even with the angels that fell from heavenNow will you help us build the Nauvoo House and Temple? If so you will be blessed; if not we will build it alone. And if you do not hearken you will not have the Spirit of the Lord for the Spirit of the Lord is in the gathering.The Apostles tried to gather together the people in their day. Christ said he would have gathered the Jews oft as a hen gathereth her chicken under her wings; but they would not [##Matthew 23:37##]It mattereth not to God and angelswhether men hear or forbear. They will carry on their work for the full set time is come We care about it. We must build a house and get an endowment and preach the gospel warn the people gather the Saints build up Zion finish our work and be prepared for the coming of ChristNow we want to send missionaries 
 to the Islands. Can you do something for them? And that is not all. We want you to contribute to the building of the Temple. We want what you have to spare. But are you affraid that you will not have enough for yourselves when you get there? How easy it is for the Lord to take it away from you by fire and otherwise. E. P. Magin had an ivory cane. I asked him for it but he did not give it to me; but he soon lost it and it did neither of us any goodThe Lord can give and take away Jacob with his faith obtained all the best cattle that his father-in-law had. [##Genesis 30:35##] Who blesses you and all the people. God. But do the people acknowledge His hand in all things. No they turn awayfrom Him and do not acknowledge Him nor realizefrom whom their blessings flowLet me tell you a secret. When the Lord shakes the earth and the hills fall down and the valleys are exalted then for brassHe will bring gold for iron silver and for stones iron. That you will have no use for gold ^for money^ and^and gods^ the like as you now have but the Lord will think as much of it then as now.Let us have some of your gold to take to Nauvoo to build the Temple and Nauvoo House so that when the kings princes and nobles of the earth call to enquire after the wisdom of Zionwe myay have a place to entertain them, and that the weary traveller may also be refreshedIs there wisdom in Zion? We think so; and the world begin to think so. Let the world come forth and translate the plates that have of late come forth if they have wisdom to do it.The Lord intends to take away the gods of the gentiles. He pulleth down and buildeth up at his own pleasure. Dont be affraidof a dollar or a hundred or a thousand dollars 
 I would not. I have made sacrifices a great many times. The Lord has promised a hundred fold and I have taken this course to get rich to give all I had, and God has given me many blessings in consequence. If I have been too bold in asking thenbe you too bold in giving. Give your all and God will repay as much again."In the afternoon Parley Pratt took up the subject of the morning. He said they not only wanted the gold and the silver but we want youand your wives and children and all you have He then spoke of the policy of Joseph in Egyptand closed by saying"Does the Saints here in Bostonknow they are identified with the laying of the foundation of a great and mighty work that is to encludeall the great and glorious purposes of God which are to be fulfilled in the last dispensation and fulness of times. And I prophesy in the name of the Lord that whether the Boston Saints or who may stand for it or rise against it that almost numberless millions will celebrate that day when the foundation of this workwas laid."Elder George A Smith followed upon the subject of what ^seems^ to the people but small things in the revelations of God in variosus ages but showed their great importance in the issue and instanced the building the ark &c. He also took up the gathering and treated the meeting to a spice of common ^sense^ versus the mysteries and concluded with an illustrative anecdote of how Elder Kimball was sent for by a certain people and brought forty miles to preach the mysteries and the amusing sequel of how he read them a lesson of practical religion 
 Elder Brigham Young arose and said"I will ^offer^ an apology for my remarks in the forepart of the day. Some may think I spoke very plain but the apology I have to make is that I will turn Thomsonion docter and give the composition without sweetening. This work is all it is my all. If this work does not live God knows I do not want to live; and I want you to understand that he that gathereth not with us scattereth and they that have tasted the bitter cup feel itWake up ye Elders who have sought to build yourselves up and not the kingdom of God! Wake up ye who have daubed with untempered morter. Hearken and hear me for I say unto ^you^ that if you do not help us build the Temple and NauvooHouse you shall not inherit the land of Zion. If you do not help build up Zion and the cause of God you shall not partake of their blessings.Many Elders seek to build themselves up and not the work of God; but when any one does this no matter who he may be ^he will not prosper^ even if one of the Twelve. As to those of the Twelve and others of the Elders who have apostatised I have known their hearts &their breathings and known their movements They thought I did not know much but I know all about them; and when I seemen preaching hte [to] build themselves up and not Zion I know what it will end in. But say you I am young. I do not care if you are young. Do you know what you are about. If so preach and labour for the building up of the city of Zion. Concentrate your means and influence there and not scatterabroad. Be faithful or you will not be 
 chosen; for the day of choosing is at the door.Why be afraid of a sacrifice?I have given my all many times and am willing to do it again. I would be glad to hear the Lordsay through His servant Joseph, let my servantBrigham give again all he has. I would obey in a moment if it took the last coat from off my back"Remarks of Elder KimballAmong other things he said"I speak in parables. I compare the Saints to a good cow. When you milk herclean she will always have abundance of milk to give; but if you milk her a little and she will soon dry up. So with the Saints. If they do but little in building up Zion they soon have but little to do with. This was the case in Cincinnati. I had a dream concerning the Saints there. I thought I was in a field of wheat that was stacked up; and we had to draw it into the barn; but when we came to open the stack the bundles would all fall to pieces and it was filled with clusters of rats and mice who had been eating up the grainI thought that these rats and mice were the Elders and official members who had been inand laying on the Church living on the wheat, eating them up instead of building up newchurches so that when the Twelve came along they could not get anything for the Temple or Nauvoo House or hardly a place to stay the rats had eaten up the wheat so. We had to go to the world for a home to stay while we were there.We are not polished stones like Elders 
 Babbit Adams Blakely Magin and the like. We are rough stones out of the mountain and when we roll through the forest and knock the bark off the trees it does not hurt us even if we should get a corner knocked off occassionally. The more we roll and get the corners knocked off the better we are; but if we were polished and smooth when we got the corners knocked off it would deface usThis is the case with Joseph Smith.He never professed to be a dressed smooth polished stone but was rough out of the mountains and has been rolling among the rocks and trees and it has not hurt him at all. But he will be as smooth and polished in the end as any other stone while many that were so very polished and smooth in the beginning get badly defaced and spoiled while rolling about."Elders Parley P and Orson Pratt followed and then the Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock the next morning^We continued^ Conference the next day which was Sunday and in the morning I preached a lengthy discourse from the ##Amos 3:7|3rd ch of Amos verse 7th##.I left Boston on the 12th of September at 5 o'clock p.m. in the Express train for Portlandand at about 10 o'clock while passing through Chesterwoots 6 miles south of Kennebunk the engine was thrown from the track in consequence of a railbeing raised eight inches by some designing miscreantThe force was such that it drove the engine about five rods ahead and smashed it to pieces with the baggage cars piled upon the top of itOne lady was brused but not dangerously and another was slightly injured. The lives of many were in danger and it seemed a mystry that so little 
 injary was done. Four cars were filled with passengers and had not the force of the coll^issin^ been broken by the baggage cars many lives would have been lost.The baggage car^s^ was^ere^ soon on fire which was with difficulty extinguished. The fireman was thrown about three yrods and escaped with a slight injury but the engineer Mr Adams from Portland was burried beneath the pile and instantly killed and the ruins had to be removed before the corps of the illfated engineer could be optained. No blame could be attached to him for the raised rail gave no warning until the engine and baggage cars were in one pile of ruins. The unfortunate man left a wife and one childA Mr Thomas Hall opened his house for the passengers and much praise was due to him and his houshold for their hospitalityI spent most of the night in the woods and got chilled throughThey sent to Portland for another engine which arrived in time to take us to Portland in the morning.Arriving at Portland I furnished the Editor of the American withThe Account of our Railway AccidentI visited my brother-in-law Ezra Carter and wrote two more letters giving an account of the foregoing catastrophe one was to the Editor of the "Boston Bee"the other to Elder John Taylor Editor of the "Times and Seasons"On the same day I walke to Scarbourough and arrived in the evening at the house of my wife's parents. Father Carter was at NewYork. I came upon Mother so sudden as she was walking across the room with a candle that she was as much surprised as though I had come 
 down from the skies and her first salutation was wheredid you come from?This was the first time I had been to my f wife's parents house without Phebe being with me and I felt like the dove without its mate. But after conversing till 9 o'clock with mother and Fabyanmy wife's brother-in-law I prayed with them and then retired to my chamber and there prayed for my absent companion and our children.Next day I rode round the country with my brother-in-law Fabyan visiting our friends and relations. I called at Mr Millikens and found Arthur Milliken and his wife Lucy the youngest sister of the Prophet Joseph. They were both home sick for NauvooThe next two days passed in family associations and after spending the evening of the second day in conversing with Faban, Rhodaand mother about Mormonism & I took my light and went to bed fearing I should no[t] see Fatherbut just as I was about to blow the light out a wagon drove up and I jumped out of bed dressed and was soon down grasping the hand of my wife's father.I sat up and talked with him till about 11 o'clock and I thought both Father and Mother looked no older than when I saw them before and they were enjoying excellent health. It seemed quite natural the next morning to sit at the table with my wife's parents again but I very much missed Phebe during this visit. The day afterI took my final call upon my friends and relatives and bade them adieu and then took the cars and arrived in Boston that night.The next day after my return to Boston I called upon George A Smith and ^brother^ W W. Phelps. In the afternoon I went on the parade ground and saw the militia in a sham fight and they made quite a splendid appearance 
 On the following evening I visited the celebrated phenologist O. S. Fowler of Boston who had examinedthe heads of the Twelve. He gave meMy Phenological Chart.Wilford Woodruff:Is a man of great action both physical and mental; does up things in a hurry;lets nothing sleep in his hands; great resolution;steamboat speepd; loves his liberty; is not disposed to be subject to the will or dictations of others; has great indipendance; difficulties only stimulate himto increased action; goes in for the largest liberty of the mass and is a democrat of the old school; prefers utility to beauty and substance to show; highly social and fond of family and friends; has but few secrets of his own and tells the plain un-varnished facts; fears but little danger; is not irressolute but descides and proceeds at once to action;His first thoughts are always best.

 I took a walk with George A Smith to Charlstonon the 22nd. We first visited the Navy Yard of the United States then the dry dock and next the U.S. Rope-Walk which we inspected in all its branchesWe took dinner and then visited Bunker Hill Monument. I entered the tube and was drawn up by steam 2210 feet where I had a view of all Boston Charleston, Cambridge Chelsea &cand then descended by the same way. Next came the State prisons with 262 prisoners at their various branches of businessAfter seeing each appartment we returned to Boston where we held meeting which was addressed by John E. Page H. C KimballP. P. Pratt Wilford Woodruff and George A SmithNext day ^23rd^ I called upon brotherHeber C. Kimball who let me have one hundred dollars ^on P. P. Pratts act^ to purchase paper with; and on the same day started per rail to Westfield and when ^I^ wegot to my destination for the day I found that P. P. Pratt and Erastus Snow were in the car before me without our knowing it. I parted with them and they continued homewardI continued my journey the next day ^24th^ and on the following I reached Farmingtonmy native place and four days later again left my father's house and arrived in New Yorkon the next day where I found Elder BrighamYoung.On the 3rd of October I took steamboat to Philadelphia and in the evening there met five of the quorum of the Twelve and other EldersNext day the others of the quorum of the Twelve started for Pittsburg I also left for home on the following day and a large number of the Saints started per rail from ^Philadelphia^ in the morning bound for Nauvoo. 
 ^Error see.^ On my journey homeward I made large purchases of paper &c at [blank]An Exciting Part of My Journey.The 19th was one of the most exciting and dangerous day's journey possible in any persons life and the scenes through which we passed was full of the grand and awfulOur boat was drawn out of the canal on cars prepared to run ^on^ the railroad to convey us over the Allegany mountainIt was a novel scene indeed to see a canal boat taken apart into four sections loaded with freights and passengers and hoisted ^on^ a railroad by incline plains into the air 1500 feet over the highest mountains and then descend into the valley below in the same way^On starting^ Horses were hitched to our cars and they drew us four miles and a half and then we were at the first incline plain which we had to asscend. Two cars were fastened at the top of the plain to the same rope that connected with ours at the bottom and the engine was stationed in a building at the sumimit of the plain which drew up and let down the carsWhen all was ready the signal was given by raising a red flag the engine was put in motion and the cars started. The first plain was half a mile long and raised one hundred and eighty feet. We went up in two minutes and I was thankful to reach the top for had the rope broke or the fastning become untied we should have rolled back to the bottom with a tremendious crashPlain No 2 raised 125 feet in half a mile and our boat rocked badly while going up but no accident hapened. We then continued on 
 a level until we came to the next incline plain.Plain No 3. was one mile and a quarter long and it rose 320 feet which we ascended in four minutes. Before we reached the top the safety carwhich was attached to our boat was thrown from the track which ^and^ dragged many rods throwing the rope off the wheels. I made a sign to the engineer who stoped and it was replaced. Here again we were in danger of breaking the rope which would have sent us back down the mountain more than a mile or turned us over into the yawinggulf below. In either case we should have been dashed to atoms. My hair rose on my head but having got all things ready we proceeded on to Plain No 4.This plain was three quarters of a mile long and ascended 265 feet. We reached the summit of this in three minutes but it looked awful to be thus suspended almost in the air with such a weight of lives and freight depending upon a knot, a rope, a pin, an engine and the care of a man which should either give way would have dashed us to atoms unlessaved by a miracleWe next continued on to PlainNo 5 which was 3/4 of a mile long and rose 280 ^feet^ This we ascended also in three minutes which brought us on to the Summit of the Allegany mountains four miles from the base and eleven hundred and seventy feet in height.I felt thankful to God that we were on the top of the mountain alive but we had to descend in the same way that we ascended. There was snow on the Summit and it was exceedingly cold. We ran on the top of the mountain about three miles and then began to descendThere were six incline plains to descend to the bottom of the mountain the 
 whole of which was attended with equal danger and carelessnessAs we came upon the brink of one of them it was found the men had left the breakers and the cars were about to run down the horses. The conducter seeing this hollowed for the man to break but finding no one at the breakersand the cars approaching the incline plain the teamster liberated his horses as soon as possible and they only just escaped being run down and the conductor sprang to the breaker himself and with great exertion barely saved us from madly running down the plain and being dashed to atomsI was standing in the cars at the time and instantly throwing off my cloak prepared myself for leaping out in case the cars should start down the plain. In either case it might have killed me but I knew it was certain death to be dashed downward and chose the alternative of a desperate chance in leaping out but through the mercy of God we were stoped at the very brinkThe whole passage across the mountainswas a constant scene of danger and I called upon God in my heart to preserve my lifeEven while on a level we were running on the edge of a precipice hundreds of feet deep over which if a wheel had broken or run off the track the cars would have plunged awfully down and made an end of all flesh on board.We passed through one tunnel in the mountain and when we reached the bottom of the incline plains I felt thankful to God that we were mostly out of danger but the^y^ put the boat together and started on the rail with all on board without horse or steamand the railroad being a little on the descent it increased in speed until it ran at a rapid rate and we were still in danger of being upset. The train ran of itself for about four miles until it came to the canal and here again to finish the day with danger a train of cars was left in our track and with all the power that could be exerted on the breaks 
 we just escaped a smash up at last. We finally got launched into the water again with no bones broken or lives lost. In conversing to ^with^ the mate in the eveningupon the subject of our passage across the mountains he remarked we were not sensible of one half the danger we had passed during the day but for one I was sensible of a great deal at leastTwo days after this we arrived at Pittsburg and I immediately engaged passage for myself and freight of paper to St Louis started the same day and met Elder Erastus Snow at Bever with a company of 50 Saints bound for NauvooNext day they took passage on the North Bendand on the AlpsPassing over farther intermediatesof my journey I arrived in St Louis re-shippedmy freight and reached Nauvoo on the 4th of November and never felt anyone more thankful to tread its soil again than myself.The week after my arrival home I spent in looking after my affairs and found them in a bad condition. My house which I commenced before I left and expected to find reared and with its roof on I found built only a few feet from the groundOn the 7th I attended Council with the Twelve and was appointed with John TaylorParley P. Pratt and Brigham Young as a committee to raise five hundred dollars to purchase paper to print the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.Sealing of myself and Wife.November the 19^11^, 1843 Hyrum Smith sealed the marriage covenant of myself and wife Phebe W. Carter for time and eternity 
 An Adulterer cannot be saved in the Celestial Kingdom.According to the Doctrine of Joseph the ProphetIn the High Council on the case of Harrison Sagersfor improper conduct offered to a female Joseph in an addresssaid "The Church has not received any license from him to commit adultery fornication or any such thing but to the contrary. If any man commits adultery he cannotreceive the celestial Kingdom of God. Even if he is saved in any Kingdom it could not be in the celestial Kingdom."He said he thought the many who had been made examples such as John C. Bennet and otherswas sufficient to show the heineous fallacy of such conductHe condemned it in unqualified terms and warned those present against such evil or they would surely bring a curse upon the heads of the guilty.Joseph afterwards met with the Twelveand he informed us that General Fryeson was in town and wished an interview with us. He had come for the purpose of getting a memorial in our behalf written to CongressNext day Sunday the 26 PresidentsJoseph and Hyrum Smith with the quorum of the Twelve sat in Council with the General and there were read to him the affidavits of Hyrum Smith Brigham YoungP. P Pratt Lyman Wight George W. Pitkin and Sidey RigdonOn the Sabbath morning Dec 2ndP. P. Pratt Orson Hyde Wilford Woodruff and O Spencerreceived their anointings preparatory to farther endowmentOn the 7th a messenger arrived from St Louis informing us that the Governor of Missourihad issued another writ for Joseph and that he was about to make a demand for him of the governor of IllionisJoseph had just made a touching appeal to the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont for assistancein obtaining redress of his wrongs in the persecutionsof Missouri. We published it in pamplet form and 
 sent ^it^ to the authorities of the United StatesThe City Council was ^and^ called to ^and^ pass^ed^ an ordinance the purport of which was that anyone henceforth who should come to take Joseph Smith on the old Missourian difficulties should be imprisoned in thecity jaol for life unless pardoned by the Governor with the consent of the mayor. This was published in an extra sheet of the NeighbourA few days after this a man by the name of Elliot one of the Missourian Kidnappers who had ran bretheren out of Illinois to Missouriand put them in prison was brought to Nauvooon a warrant and bound under 3000 dollars bonds He was also under another warrant for threatening the life of Joseph and the charge was proved against him but the Prophet forgave him and he was discharged. On the case Joseph made an eloquent speech manifesting mercy towards his enemies when they were in his power but with uplifted hands he declared that if Missouri came against us any more he would fight them and defend his rightsA warrant was also issued against Col Williams who was the leader of the kidnapping affray but he had gathered around him a mob and swore defiance so the officers returned to Nauvoo for counsel and assistanceOn the 23rd At President Joseph Smith's I with my wife met with the quorum through the day in the endowments.

 the Tennessee Saints. I did so and there were with us brother Smoot and his family.The farther duties of a few days more in my official calling and in attending to my family affairs and forwarding the building of my house brought us to the close of the yearSynopsis of 1843.TravelsI travelled in thirteen of the United States and the distance of five thousand one hundred and seventy one miles.MeetingsHeld twenty six meetings and attended 20 Councils and ConferencesBaptisms &cI baptized six persons ordained five Elders blessedfifteen childreen and administered to 25 sick ^and confirmed ten^MarriedagesI married two personsWritings & ReportsI wrote 25 letters received 12 and reported and recordedin my journal seven discourses of Joseph the Prophetand reported and recorded eight sermons of the TwelveLabours of the YearMy time not occupied on my mission east was spent mostly in the Printing Office for which I also while on my mission purchased paper and obtained subscribers.

 COLORADO MISSION.879 South Corona Street,Denver, ColoradoMay 17, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City,Utah.Dear Brother:Elder Franklin D. Richards wrote me underdate of May 14, 1897, and wanted to know if the five Eld-ers from the Brigham Young Academy of Provo, spent theirsummer vacation in the Colorado Mission, if they couldor would pay their own expenses. In answer to the sameI would say, they are all able and willing to pay their own expenses.Should you decide to send the brethern here it woul[d]oblige me if you would send me word to that effect asit would give me time to arrange to receive them, and Ican notify each of them before they leave Provo justwhere to get off train so as to save them exrtra expensein going from Denver to their several fields of labor,which would be probably from $2.590 to $5.00 each.We had a very pleasant meeting at Overland yesterdayafternoon in a grove of trees near the Platte river,after meeting^,^ Mr. Richmond and family requsted baptism.Two ladies and a Mr. Hoover and Wife of Denver, and a Mr.Swigart of Fort Logan have requested Baptism, and we will 
 attend to the matter in the near future.There are three families that desire to emigrate fromOverland to some place in Utah, where they can take upland. They have come to me for advice; would it be properfor me to recommend them to go into the Ashley countryin Pres. Bennion stake? If not kindly inform me what is your desire concerning them, and I will advise themaccordingly.Ashley can be reached by team much easier thanany other part of Utah from this place.The Elders are all well and working faithfully in themissionary field and are being kindly received by thepeople.Prtaying God to bless you with health and strengthand asking a kind remembrance to all the brethren,I remain, Your brother in the Gospel,John W. Taylor[Joseph Fielding Smith] Under these circumstances it will be proper to issue calls to the brethrennamed, (bro. F. D. Richards has the list)to serve as missionaries in Colo.during their vacation, leaving itto their judgment or discretion todecide to accept or not on the con-ditions named that they will beartheir own expenses. The church notbeing in a condition financially 
 to do it. I think it wouldbe as well for bro. Taylor torecommend the parties he nameswho desire his counsil on thematter to go to Ashley. Bro.Taylor should notify theauthorities at Ashley of theirintention to go there, if theyso decide, and about thetime to look for them, sothat they may be properlyreceived and lookedafter.J. F.

Ensign, Charles Mann, DavidMann, J. H. Grant, Herbert A. White, Wm C.Clive and I came to Manassa. We spent 3 days in the Kanyon up the Conejas riverwith 100 of the saints and their friendsrusticating and we had a very enjoyabletime upon returning to the valley weheld meeting in Manassa, Sanford,Richfield, Morgan, Sunflower, Antoneto andEastdale, at the latter place I ordained BishopJensen as per your instructions to Prest. 
 2Albert R. Smith.Haveing one week left to spare before con-ference, which convened in Manassa onAug 14th and 15th I felt a very strong desireto preach the gospel to the gentiles whowas liveing among the cities of the saintsin this valley. I made my desire known toPresident Albert R. Smith and councillors andwhen I told them, I was strongly impressedto go from house to house and visit thestrangers and their families in our midstthey heartily approved of the suggestion. Icalled to my assistance several of the sisterswe met together with the Presidency of the stake ^and^Bishop Jackson and pps sisters and we fastedand prayed unto the Lord to give us access to the hearts of the people and asked our heavenlyfather to soften the hearts of those whomwe went to see, and open their eyes that thay may see their sins and 
 3also see the necessity of serving God andrepenting of their ^sins^ and unite with thesaints in building up the Kingdom ofGod in this land, and we made covenantthat we would fast till the followingday. And I stood up among the Eldersand the spirit of Prop^h^ecy came upon me and bore testimony that if we werefaithful ^the Lord would send his angels before our face and^ many would beleive on ourwords and would repent of  o theirsins and go into the waters ofbaptism, and every one spoke and boretestimony they beleived in my words.We took a list of all the gentileswithin a circuit of about 20 milesand s[e]perated ourselves and went outtwo by two and divided up the familiesequally among us which wasabout 40 in all, and went forthtrusting in the Lord, and we took with 
 4us tracts, voice of Warning, books of Mormonand other works that teaches the word of Godand we went by day and by night intotheir homes, and we searched them out andif they were 5 or 6 miles away fromhome we went and found them, andexplained plainly why we had come untothem, and many beleved on our wordsand promised to come out to our meetingsat conference time, but some did notbeleive, but would say unto us: "if thecontentions among the mormons wasthe fruits of Mormonism they didnot such a gospel as we taught &c"but we showed unto them what theyhad seen among the saints was theweakness of man and ^that^ perfection didnot dwell in the flesh, and wecontended for the faith and for thePlan of salvation and which God had

C. Clive met with quite a serious bicycle accidentabout four weeks ago, which has di[s]abled him for about amonth forom performing any missionary labor, but is now al-most well again and will go into the missionary field nextweek.The reports from all the ELders are to the effectthat they are holding meetings, and that they are treatedkindly by the peopie.We are making a special effort to sell our church worksas we find that the people will read a book that they payfor, whereas if it is given to them they are liable to layit aside and not read it. 
 5restored again to the earth and while we metsome opposition God was with us andwe bore testomony unto them standing up intheir homes in the power and demonstrationof the Holy Ghost. We invited them to our meetings and conference and left thembooks to read and promised them if theywould read them with good and honesthearts and a prayerful spirit thatGod would reveal unto them thethings that was written therein wastrue, and thus we visited them all.We held conference Saturday andSunday and I felt constrained to advisethe Elders to confine their remarks tothe repentance, faith, and baptismand the laying on of hands and tobear testimony of ^the prophet^ Joseph Smithand the Divinity of the Book ofMormon. 
 We held a conference on June 19th and 20th in the city ofDenvsr and it seemed to have a very good effect upon thepeople, and has been t[h]e means of gaining for us more friendsWe will hold a conference in Pueblo July 17th and 18th.We could use several more ELders to very good advantage.Praying God to bless you, and asking an interestin your faith and prayers, I remainYour brother in the Gospel.John W.

 6Our conference was held in a fine Bowerybuildt by the saints of Sanford.The Lord poured out his Holy spiritupon the young Elders as they spakeone bye one and the singing rendered bythem seemed Devine, and the Holy spiritbore witness unto all who was honestthat their testimony was true.On monday we had the pleasureof takeing 45 down into the watters ofbaptism, and from 800 to 1000 personscame out to witness the sons anddaughters of God receive a remissionof their sins for the people rejoiced tosee the wicked come into the fold of ChristWe held a Priesthood meeting inSanford and the Lord blessed us with his spiritand a number of men who had been intransgressiong came forth at the closeof the meeting and confessed their sins

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day Saints.P.O. Box B.Salt Lake City, Utah, March 23rd, 1896.ELDERS JAMES E. STEELE,ROBERT L. BYBEE,JOS. S. MULLINER,Presidency of the Bingham Stake.Dear Brethren:Your letter of the 13th inst., addressed to PresidentGeorge Q. Cannon, contains an enquiry concerning the correct languageto be used in ordaining a man to the office of an Elder. You say somelittle difference of opinion exists among the brethren of your Stake onthis point.We do not like to write out a form of ordination for theoffice of an Elder. But it is a very simple ceremony, as are all theceremonies connected with the ordinances. This is beautifully illustra-ted in the form which the Lord gives, on page 609 of the Book of Mormon,concerning the ordination of Priests and Teachers.There are some people who seem to attach great importanceto phraseology, and are very technical, and think things are not doneright unless every word is spoken just as it should be. This is notright. A spirit of that kind leads to disputations as to forms; and wefind considerable of that arising from time to time in theological clas-ses and among others. That which is necessary in ordaining a man isto ordain him to the office in the Aaronic Priesthood or the MelchisedekPriesthood (whichever it may be) by the authority of tyhe Holy Priesthood 
 and in the name of Jesus. This, in a few words, is all that we thinknecessary to be said upon the subject.With kindest regards,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said we all stood in need of Faith, especially at the present time, we have ^had^ good peace for a great many years, and he had no doubtbut every one would sooner or later be tried to the very core. We should be prepared for every thing that may come along. We are the friends of God, and the world is it war with us, and he was glad of it. God has put into ourhands the Gospel of Christ, the Kingdom of God, and that makes the world mad, as for Polygamy they did not care so much for it, as for the dust under their feet.If it requires the United States to shed moreblood of the saints, before their cup is full, they will shed it, there never was a more corrupt nation dwell on the face of the earth, than that which now exists on this covenant.And the saints should never in their prayers 
 forget to pray for Colfax, and the Government in the right way. We have everything to encourage us in doing right -- to keep the word of Wisdom, and whatever is required of usNo man ever apostatizes from this church without transgressing the laws of God, either secretly or openly -- the Spirit of God will never leave any one without sufficient cause.Prest Young is not without Revelation, he is not without the power and Spirit of God, he has councilled the saints for a great many years, by the mind and will of God, and if everything had to be done by Revelation, many of us would now be living under great condemnation. 
 Elder W. Woodruff in his acquaintance with Joseph Smith & Brigham Young, said he never kneweither to give any council but what always came out true, instancing the Sidney Rigdonwhom Joseph wished to through [throw] off &cWe have got to follow the Lord the Celestial law must be abided or we never can be exhalted.Prest. Young is our Lawgiver and standsbetween us and God, and if God has any revelation to give to man, he willnot give it to him ^me^, nor Billy Godbe, but it will come through Prest. Young he will speak through his mouthpieceGod has placed him as our leader in temporal as well as in other things weshall be dictated by revelation and counciland those who abide it and will be saved. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff. Moved and was secondedThat this meeting be turned into a caucusmeeting, for the purpose of making nominating our City Officers, preparatory to the forthcoming Election. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we were approaching a very interesting time, and as the Lordwill have a tried people we shall ^have^ a severe test to prove and try the saints something that make us look around us, and ascertain where we shal stand the nation on this continent is nearly ripe in iniquity, and willcertainly be destroyed, according to the revelations given to Joseph Men that are not groundin their faith by revelation, must past away in the trying hour every weapon that is formed against us, will not prosper Let the Elders read the revelations and become acquainted with them that we may seewhat is coming The Lord does not require us to make war upon our enemiesuntil he reveals it from heaven He could afford to lay down his temporallife, rather than forfeit his eternal salvation If it was necessary let Prest Young and others be hid up in these mountains but he did not think the Lord was going to destroy the faithful saints of God but let every faithfulMan of God be willing to assume his share of responsibility, instead of throwing everything on the 
 Elder W. Woodruff said, this being a school of ^the^ prophets,should be profitable to those who come here, the spirit of God that each Elder possesses is the spirit of prophesy--we have had the living oracles in our midst for 40 years on the 6th April next--And as a people we have got to prepare a place for the coming of the Son of Man--the United States had been warned ^lately^ by several hundredmissionaries, perhaps for the last time, and their testimonies will stand good before God, Angels and Men--the situation of the people required the Servants of God to interfere with temporalthings, and council and instruct them in the principle of cooperation &c, this gives offence to some,but all things are necessary from time to time --he then urged the necessity of each one who comes to this school, observing the rules which we have covenanted to observe -- We want an increase of faith, so as to meet all the opposition and persecution we may have to encounter.He then commended the Calmness and composure of our leader Prest Young, under the most trying 
 shoulders of Prest Young There was a very wicked spirit in this City, which was connected with the same lying spirit at Washington.When Colfax was here, he had the pleasure of preach-ing the Gospel to him and warn him against sheddinginnocent blood let us stand valiently and bear our testimony, and leave the event in the hands of God let us go before the Lord, and pray that Hypocrites and liars may be gathered out. 
 circumstances, encouraged the school to put their trust in God, and be united, and do our duty,And our Leaders will be inspired to lead this peoplein a straight path and Zion will be built up --and the Go blessings of God will rest upon his people, and may thHe enable each one to do their is my prayer in the name of Jesus -- 
 Elder W. Woodruff, loved to see men valient in a good cause, especially in the testimony of Jesus He had known Elder Taylor as far backas Kirtland, stand up nobly in defending the prophet Joseph The spirit made manifest here to day, he had no doubt existed amongall the Elders of Israel.This was the great Kingdom of our God, and our Government will not rot and come to 
 Elder W. Woodruff . said a Man must live his religion if he expects to be benefited by it.He was satisfied that a faithfull man of God willhave his rewardOne fault among latter day saints was a looseness in paying his obligations. We should improve in this No one apostatizes from this church in a day, it generally commences in a neglect of dutyMany both in and out of the Church find faultwith Prest Young, and say that he tyranizes over the people, but he has known him fir many years, both in public and private, and no one, whom he ever knewhad so few failings as Brigham Young, butHe had been a great benefactor to the poor, whom he had brought from their poverty in the old country and placed them in comfortable circumstances in these vallies. We as a people must keep the commandments of God if we expect to be saints - we must try to overcome our taste for Tea, Coffee,Tobacco, Whiskey &c it was a warfare, and will be, as long as we live, but the truth that leads to eternal life is a narrow one. 
 nought, hav being about to fill up the measure of their iniquity we do not know what the Lord wants to do with us, but we must take it patiently, and whatever the Lord says through his servant Brigham, we will do.He had been baptized for all his friends, and was ready to go behind the vail any time the Lord wanted him but Zion will prosper and be built up, every latter day Saint should live to build it as far as they have strength and ability. He then prophesied the speedy destruction of this Nation, and the establishment if the Kingdom of God  
 our future condition and exaltation, certainly depends on the course we pursue here.We are the best people on the earth, and he had no doubt but we were trying to improve our lives.He did not believe, the wicked will ever disturb us from our homes   if we will only do right, and prize our priveleges.He knew this was the Gospel, and these are the people of God, and we have the ordinancesbut if Zion needs cleansing, God will cleanse her. He prayed that God would prepare us for whatever is coming   to be true and faithful & c 
 On Saturday May 14th 1870Theological Class met at the Tabernacleat One o clock pmPresent Prest Geo. A. Smith presidingAfter singing Prayer by Elder S. W. Richards SingingElder A P. Rockwood recommended a systematic organized effort being made to destroy the Grasshoppersunless it is done, he was satisfied there will be but little raised this season.Elder W. W. Woodruff  said the best plan he had found to destroy them was to get a large sheet, and a man at each corner to drag it through the grain, and when caught & bury them it certainly was their duty to make an organized effort, and if after that is done, and the Crops are destroyed, we shall have the satisfaction of having done our duty. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff reported that a considerable effort had been made during the week by BroTurnbow and those who had turned out to assist him, in the destruction of the Grasshoppers, and hoped that a union of Gra exertion will be continue to be made that our wheat may be spared 
 Elder W. Woodruff had a pleasant journey up north the leading Council given, was ^for^ the Saints to lay up their grain had they heeded it before, the Grasshoppers would not have visited usWoollen and other Factorys were also recommended for the saints to buildZion is increasing We shall soon have a Mighty host in these vallies Parents should teach their children the Gospel of ChristHe hoped the Saints would magnify their callings and build up the Kingdom of GodHe would like to have them build one Templein these vallies hundreds had got to be built.If we did our duty, we shall never be driven away from these valliesWhen the time comes, for the Saints to go back to build up Zion in Jackson County that these vallies will not be vacated entirely, neither will all return to that Country. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff refered to the manypriveleges that latter day Saints enjoy, wasglad many were waking up to the subjectof Baptism for the dead He had beenbaptized and sealed to all his progenitorsthat he could find out He then madecomparisons between the beautify and gloryof our religion, and the nonsense ofwhat the world called  religion When we pray, we pray to a being who hasa Head, a Heart, and a perfect organization people apostatize, because they dont keep thecommandments of God, they dont study thescriptures,  what is not yet revealed will be, a little at a while until we shallreceive all ^that^ is essential for our perfection &c 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said we are all here by FaithUtah would never have been inhabited without faithJoseph Smith brought forth the book of Mormonthrough faith He himself, had been sustainedAnd done what he had done since he embracedthe Gospel, by Faith He was one who wentup in Missouri to fight the state, to redeem Zionby Faith 
 All our works had been performed by faithHe had faith that our enemies would be stirredup to fight against us but Salvation, such thatis promised unto us should stimulate us to exercisefaith and our works should correspond to do whatGod required of us Some had not faithenough to retain their standing in the church, they hadgradually given way to temptation and given wayto overt acts until the Spirit of the Lord was entirelywithdrawn from them.God was going to build up Zion in spite of Earthor Hell A man who has received the HolyGhost had the Apostleship &c and then fallaway, had far better have had a Millstone coput around his neck and cast into the seaHe did not want to live one hour onlywhile he continued in the faithLet our wants be known before the Lord, and prayfor our friends and enemies also.We will ^have^ plenty of new principles as fast as wecan appreciate and live up to them 
 Elder W. Woodruff commented severely on the wilful practise of Herd boys destroying fences, and damaging the late crops,And shewed the necessity of enter^ing^ into all our operations, the principle of cooperation.^The importation of Bees and Fish^ 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said, he alone was responsible for what was said about Bp Gardners ward party, he was not present himself, but from reports that reached him, he had stated last saturday what he did, was pleased with Bp Gardners statement, realized the difficulties that B'ps labour under, especially in the management of parties, where licquor happens to get in, if only by a few He hoped Bp Gardner would be blest in controuling his ward he entertained a high regard for him 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we had been in school a good while, and ^he^ believed we were approaching avery great and important crisis as a people he also believed, we were improving and ad-vancing. The Angel told Joseph what wouldbecome of cerain nations, quoted many passages of ancient scriptures, and taught him their application, by this means he was t instructed and taught from a pure and correct fountain.the spirit of revelation grew up in him until he became throughly acquainted with it.The same spirit dwelt in Bro Brigham and ^had^ been growing in him for many yearswe want to learn God and the spirit of Godas well as the sciences, for there are many great philosophers well versed in the sciences are not only ignorant of God, but are infidelin their principles. Let any one read the Pro-phecies in Isaih, Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants with a prayerful spirit, and we can almost write the future of many nations.He spoke of the diversity of gifts and qualifications, some quick to discern one thing, and some another. There was a necessity for each one to learn the voice of the Spirit, mentioning two cases ^of^ self preservation in is own experience by listening to and obeying the whisperings of the spirit. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said in behalf of the parent association, for the introduction of Improved Stock, Bees, Swine, Sheep &c &c, while they were calling ^upon^ other counties to cooperativee with them in establishing branch associations it was very necessary for us in Salt Lake County to start in a cooperative effort to herd our stock so as to have the ranch cleared of all that is now running loose have a regular system on an upright principle that every one may have their rights there as been a great amount of dishonesty practised by individuals who have undertaken to take stock & sheep on shares, and we want to do away with this. 
 (3) Jan 14, 18701W. Woodruff. continued adverted to the hand of God in our present peace and quiet we enjoy in this City, notwithstanding the hue and cry of our bitter enemies, in the set time of the almighty Not only this Nation, but other Nations that lift their hands against this work will be broken to pieces and come to nought. Prayed that we might all become more acquainted with the spirit of God, understand his purposes, and be prepared for the great things that are coming to pass. 
 Elder W. Woodruff felt it was a time when we ought to watch as well as pray we are having a great influx of strangers in our midst and among them, many speculators, who are trying to get our land and Houses by purchase or otherwise He strongly recommended the brethren who have property to rent, to call on Prest. Wells for counciland always have the writings drawn up by Judge Smith or Hosea Stout, and not sign any documents drawn up by strangers for fear we should have advantage taken of us No amount of means could tempt him to sell his inheritanceand he hoped the brethren would hold their homes as being most sacredThe Mines were now being opened and developed, for the special benefit of the saints, and by and bye if we do right, our eyes will be opened to see ^that^ the hand of the Lord is over us for good Zion will soonarise and arise shine, and increase, our enemies are not going to destroy us, nor take away our rights. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said these important subjects, require our wisdom, patience and perseverance He spoke of Father Russell ship builder, who before embracing the Gospelhad his Life & Ships Insured, but after that, drew his interest out, and paid his Insurance money into the church, and trusted in God to take care of his life and property.He also explained some particulars about starting the Co operative HerdSpoke of the opposition we have had to contend with from the Government Officials who have tried to bring us into bondage & trouble but have signally failed, God has heard the prayers of the faithful and delivered us out of the hands of the wicked he feels that God will continue to break every weapon that is formed against us our enemies are very short lived, God has cut them off and will do so, & build up Zion.let us therefore combine and cooperate together and have integrity and shew that are in every worthy of the confidence of both God and man 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we ought to rejoice in the privelege of living in a day when we can assist in building a Temple to the name of the most highno one since the days of Solomon has had such a privelege many efforts have been made to destroy us in this generation, but the hand of God has been outstretched towards us and delivered us from the hands of our enemies 
 We are abundantly able to do what is required of us if we are only willing.He felt anxious to respond to the call made last Saturday for funds to emigrate the poorbut having no ready means on hand was the only cause he did not.He would give 1,000 lbs Flour to help feed the hands that work on the TempleIt was quite a privelege to help build up the Kingdom of God We cannot take behind the vail any of our property with us, but we can take with us, those blessings that have been put on our heads by the servants of God, if we will only live for them. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, spoke on the same subject ^of sustaining home manufactory;^Shall we sustain our own machinery and manufactories, or shall we neglect itwe ought to study the interests of Zion, if we dont study its interests, we had better g leave and go to California we had better Cooperate in everything that will build up Zion we  have the power to build a Temple and occupy it a privelege which the ancient apostles never had We are building a Zion here, though Earth & Hell are opposing us whatever council is given us, let us carry it out. 
 Elder W. Woodruff warned the school against telling out of this house what is spoken here, but keep sacred the covenantswe have made 
 Elder W. Woodruff, said the secret of the present antagonism about Polygamy, was simply, because it was a command of God, and Lucifer was opposed to it. He did not believe in abandoning one principle of the Gospel to please this Nation or any other. We can afford to risk the issue and consequences of the present persecution the controversary is between God and the Nation.Let us remember to keep the commandmentsof God, to attend to our prayers and duties and God will deliver us We shall certainly come off much better, by cleaving to our religion than by bartering any portion of it away for the sake of a state government Let us unite our prayerstogether. 
 Elder W. Woodruff strongly recommended the Elders of Israel to keep a Journal of the dealings of God with them the Prophet Joseph used to urge this upon the Elders k Bro Woodruff said heco Kept a record of every sermon that he heard Joseph preach He wished that a more correct account had been Kept of the early doings of the early Elders of the church, and the dealings of God with his people he has never neglected one day without writing something in his diaryIn regard to the spirit of Prophecy, we are apt to look two high, and except too much in the wrong direction the still small voice of the spirit was what we should seek after and cultivate the church in its infancy When a man was called to go on a mission, the Lord 
 had to be enquired of, and obtain from Him a revelationbut now Prest. Young living in the light of revelationhundreds are called to go on a mission and have to start in a few hours the Church has grown, andwe are continually led by the spirit of revelation We have much to be grateful for, the Kingdom is onward and upward He then related several forewarnings of danger ^by the spirit of God^ which he always listened to and acted upon, and himself, family & friends saved from sudden destruction 
 Elder W. Woodruff hoped to live long enough to see pleasant Ephraim enjoy all the blessings,that were long since, enjoyed by their forefathers  he then spoke of the Elders of Israel who held the destinies of the Nations in their hands, and the necessity of them living worthy of their high and holy calling. He then related a dream that he had while on a Mission to in England  pertaining to the Lamanites. he saw a beautiful Temple rerected on the mountains of Israel, he went in, and while there, a large number of Laman-ites came in and seated themselves in a placeby themselves, by and bye, they began to work,and they seemed to accomplish more in two hours than others could do in a day, but a strict account was kept of ^all^ the labour that was performed by every one in that house. and they appeared to have been inspired by some prophet to enter that Temple, and enter upon those blessings promised by their forefathers. 
 the acts of the wicked will fall upon their own head, and the righteous will be delivered it is our privelege to ask the Lord for a State Government, and if its his will, he will grant it, by raising up friends to urge our petition through both Houses of Congress do not forget our prayers, nor fail in any of our duties and God will establish Zion in these Mountains. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke with gratitude to God, for the prospect of a bountiful Harvest. He wa had also commenced to favour Zion, to build it up, gather the poor, would bless the leaders of Iassrael with the light of revelationand,  &c 
 We are a branch of Ephraim, and received the Gospel first. and should treat the poor degraded Indian with Kindness, for they fellthrough unbelief, we should also be anxious to build this Temple here, and that in St George.He then spoke of the persecution that was pressing upon us by the heads of this nation, by unlawfully keeping in bondage, our Brethren. as Latter day Saints, we should seek the blessing of God of upon the saints, and his displeasure upon his enemies. The Leaders of this people have stood the test, and been proved for many years hence, we should hold up their hands, and exercise faith for them, these honours and labours that God has put upon our brethren, should stimulate us follow in their footsteps. a faithfulhumble follower of Jesus Christ, is in a far more exalted position, than can be confer'd upon men by the world. Let us be faithful to God and each other, and endure to the end, that we may be saved for Jesus sake. Amen.

 Great Salt Lake City Oct. 16, 1849Elder Wilford WoodruffBeloved BrotherWe received lengthy communications, scraps and Papers from you,by the last mail, which we have scarce had time to read, in full; businesshas pressed so heavily upon us, but we understand your situation, and willmake all the communication at this time, that the nature of the case will admit.Our mail is closed, and about ready to start. OurGeneral Epistle is in Type, by which you will learn General news, and weshall send this, and many more communications by Express, to overtake themail in the mountains. Your friends are well, and the People generally,and we would all be glad to see you here with your family.Gather up all the Saints in the East, this Winter, andmake ready, and in the Spring come with them, and you will see greatimprovements have taken place since you left home. Tell the brethren ofCapital to bring means to establish factories.Say to the brothers Livingston, at Peterboro, that nextyear there will be wool enough raised in the Valley, to supply aconsiderable factory, that the cloth is needed here, that here is the placefor building Zion, that here is a better place to manufacture and makemoney than any other place: and persuade one or all, and all suchto remove with delay to this place. Next Season we design asettlement over the rim of the Basin on the South, where cotton,rice and sugar cane will flourish, and from whence we can getour supplies: but even at present, it would be far better to transportthe raw cotton from the States and have it manufactured here,than to bring the cloth, for there are good water privileges in abundance,and experienced workmen on hand. therefore start out a companyboth for cotton and woollen manufacturing, this Winter ready forspring's emigration with machinery, &c, and every facility will begranted them in this place, which possible can be. 
 Also we want some Iron founders. There is coal and Ironnot far distant in good locations, and moulders in the Valley, thereforedo not fail to bring us a founder, for castings of all descriptions aremuch needed, and there is no location in the States so good as thisfor the business.There is no class of mechanics or manufactures but can do well here, for we are in the centre of Creation, and in need of manythings except Gold, but should we tell you all we have seen andhandled you could scarce believe.In the short space of about onemonth we have received by voluntary donation over 5,500 dollarsfor a perpetual emigrating fund, and sent Bishop Hunter, to the States to gather up the Poor. Further particulars you will glean from ourEpistle, and our letters to brother Hyde, a copy of which you willdoubtless see. You are an agent to solicit and receive donations forsaid fund: any means you can gather and forward to Bishop Hunterat Kanesville early in the Spring will be immediately applied, toits destined object.Find brother Benjamin S. Wilber of New York and bring him on with all his goods. We also want brother Jesse C. Little to settleup his affairs and come to this place. This is the place for business,for increasing and doing good.Come with the Saints, Master Workmen, machinery, with yourGold, (not Silver 'tis too heavy) and all precious things, and when you arrive,we shall have so much to tell you what we cannot write, youwill be ready to declare "a half has not been told me," Yes Bro Woodruffstretch out your arms like a man of God, and gather up and bringa host to Zion.With our best wishes and blessings on yourself and family andall the faithful. We remain your brethren in Christ.Brigham YoungHeber C. KimballWillard Richards 
 P.S. Agreeably to your last letter, brother Richards expects you haveaccomplished your mission with brother Russel, and that the transferhas been completed long before this.WR

 [sideways text] Elder Orson SpencerJany. 18 1848 [end of sideways text]Liverpool Jan. 18, 1848Dear Pres. Wilford WoodruffHaving learnt by a Letterreceived yesterday from Pres. Brigham Young dated Nov.25th that you with the greater part of your Quorum hadreturned to Winter Quarters, I resolved to Seize, (nota favorable moment for writing to you,) but rathera forced capture of some fleeting moments to fulfillmy promise & delight in the matter. It cheers my heartto learn that you have become sound enough tomake a visit of two thousand miles over the mountainsin one season in company with so many of yourbeloved Quorum. All in health & increased strengthI say to glory to God for this glorious & successful butarduous expedition of the Latter Day Liberators!This expedition will constitute a new epoch in theannals of the everlasting kingdom, that will beconspicuous for worlds to come for the energyenterprize & indefatigable endurance of the performanceThe results of this expedition are endlessly by praiseworthyand glorious. I shall now venture to tell the BritishSaints and the Nations of Europe that Zion is establishedThat their eye may look upon her that is to be thejoy of the whole earth & and an eternal excellency."Beautiful for Situation is that place. The mountainsare round about the fat valley of the great basin 
 as a munition of Rocks. The splendid intelligence of the millennial Era is requisite in order to appreciatethe worth of the labors of the first founded of the kingdomof Latter day glory. I shall boldly declare that aresting place for the laboring & heavy laden of allNations is now prepared. I can now answer themoanful cry of the emigrant that has often beenreiterated in my ears in this land; "When maywe emigrate? I have long been out of businessand expending my means, when can I emigrate?Now I have the happiness through your toils andmemorable discovery & liberal permission to announcethe welcome day. I do not regret having come toEngland on this important mission, neither shallI regret an invitation to return when it comes fromyour dear & honored Quorum. The past year hasbeen one of great prosperity as to the enlargementof the Church in this Island & the increase of faith anddiligence & zeal in the work of the Lord. Many thousandshave been added to the Church & peace & unionhave pervaded all parts of the Kingdom of Christ on this Island. In Wales there has been addedto the Church about one hundred & fifty a monthfor five or six months past. In nearly all placesthe work moves forward with the most delightfulimpulse. All feel strong & ardent for the increaseof the Saved. What will be the effect of Emigrationupon the future impulse & progress of the work is 
 yet problematical. American Elders will become scarce after three more leave the Island. A few recruitswould not come amiss. Agreeable to my instructionsfrom counselcil I shall open the channels of emigrationwith all possible diligence. The Emigrants will almostunavoidably stop at different places. Some areanxious to go, if they can reach no further than St Louisor even New Orleans & I am glad that the Councilsaw fit to appoint an agent to look after them at theseplaces. I need not inform you that it will be verynecessary. I have increased the number of our Paperduring the year about 5 or six hundred. The presentnumbers now issued at the commencement of theTwo first no's of the tenth volume are about 32,000I have printed nearly 200,000 small Tracts or"Invitations" and more than 150,000 pages of largerTracts which are spread abroad among the peopleaiming thereby to warn & invite all the inhabitanitsof this Island as far as practicable. The Saints arealmost enthusiastic in preaching & warningthe people in every possible way. The new Editionof the Hymn Book is nearly all sold. A smallnew Edition of the Book of Mormon is also just printed.I have also just printed a Small volume mostlyof Letters in continuation of a reply to Rev. Wm CrowilBoston Mass. U. S. A. which received a ready demandI have purchased a Phonatic Font of 329 poundswright for the Council according to request, and shall 
 Send ^it^ by Bro Wheelock Soon; having no chance toSend it Sooner safely. I shall also purchase agood microscope to send at the same time. I haveaddressed three Letters to Pres. Young since I havebeen here, one of them was Superscribed to Pres.Young or Pres. Hyde. I have in the absence ofPres. Young (over the mountain) written to Eld.Orson Hyde on the business of the Church, supposinghim to be the proper authority to counsel me.I am fully ready to return home or to remain orgo elsewhere hopeing thereby to secure the confidenceof the "Twelve" whom I ever desire to obey in the Lordas it is meet. The friendly hint given me by Pres.Young when he appointed me to this mission and latelyrepeated & formerly seconded by Bro Pratt, viz notto walk in the steps of my defaulting predecessors in officealmost inclined me to look over my geography tosee in what part of the world it is that they poke onehorse because another horse is unruly. My heart is sometimes melted like wax to think of my desolate andnow sick little children & I could return to them withjoy if so counselled. But I am blessed so far with the faith & support of all Israel & hope ever to merit thesame by well doing. Crime & distress are awfulin this land and the evils increase rather than disminish.The power of the endowment is mightily visible in Europeif not in America. My playful allusion to the hint toPres. Young is, done with the utmost kindness & respectfor his motives & the wisdom of the hint. Remember mein the praying circle for I never felt my need of wisdommore. Give my love to your wife & Pres Young & I want to say morebut business hurries & my sheet is full.Orson Spencer

The most of the leavesremain on the appletrees yet. My health is not veyvery good this win-ter I fearl much of the effects of my summers work. The chil-dren all go to school but Bula, Willford has had very bad eyesfor 8 or 10 days so that he cannot read or study. Fathers health isuncommonly good this winter but I never knew him as fractiousas he is and has been lately. Last thursday sister's Pratt, Hyde,Taylor Kimball Benson Hooper & Smith made me a visit, (sisterYoung being quite sick she could not come,) the most of thembrought their letters and read them and we had a very pleasenttime. Sister Smith's letter was read first which gave the infor-mation of Br. Pratt's addition to himself. I think there was somejokes passed and prophecyes, delivered upon the occasion, however it was 
 nothing unexpected to her as she said they had decided upon itbefore he went away that is if he saw any one that would answerthe purpose that he wished, he then wrote her that he had foundone she said that he had been trying a number of months ^to find someone.^I soon sent to the office when I had time and received yourpackage and distributed them according to the directions I amglad to have you write to them ^the children^ as they have often told me thatyou cared nothing about them but to scold them, they were muchpleased with their letters I thought them very good and they allwant to write you Moroni not excepted he was much pleasedand wants the children to write you for him but Bula thinksshe can write write and dictate herself, so she has written some.Moroni does about as well as can be expected but he requires atight reign kept. I thought I would not say any thing aboutmy family cares to you to distrub your felicity but you askedme to tell you how the children Emma & Sarah got along. Ithink the children & Emma get along very well in schoolWillford has not been able to study much for sometime onaccount of his eyes I have got him a new pair of boots and paid$3.50 cts for them. E s^t^ays with me most of the time but the childrendo much better without her than with her as she waits for them &they for her so the work is principally left for me also she stirsthem up to make a noise and theirs is much jargon betweenher and Susan which frets father much she inclines tostay here all the time she makes me much more trouble than she 
 G. S. L. Citty Dec 28 [18]55My Dear WillfordWith pleasure I acknowlegethe reception of your general epistle from the hand ofbr Pugh which was well written and a rich treasurewell distributed to the family and they duly appreciatedit Your letters have quite an effect upon the childrenand family. I am very glad to hear from you oftenI forgot to tell you that we get but one numberof the news I thought perhaps you had one numbersent to you. We are all well. The measles are aboutand I am afraid that Bula will get them.We have sent a large package of letters to youby Br Haywood with which I think you will beamused and Phebe has just received one by mailin answer to one she wrote on the windowseat in the dusk I knew nothing she wrote, she says she will do better nexttime. The weather for 3 days past has been very cold but todayis mild. Br Haywood expected to have gone 2 day before thisbut he expects to start in the morn. I have just writenthis to say that we have received I think all your lettersSo good by my love good byPhebe W. WoodruffI think if you had as much confusion about youas I think you have it would be perplexing to you 
 does me good but she thinks she thinks she does well. If thechildren were alone I could say to them you must and youmust not but with her I must be very careful to not give offence she was quite offended to think that you told Sarahthat her education and principles were establish she said sheshould tell you that it was a fine thing that one of the familywas established baulderdash has showed itself a numberof times there by her but I have as yet kept my foot on it.Sarah has had a cold but has got over it and is as crossas is possible she has got a web in the loom of about 20 yds.she has been 2 weeks about it and I think if she keeps on shewill get it out by spring. Miss Bula is so turbulent thematI am obliged to take a stick to her sometimes, taking allthings here together I have all that I can get along withI think S. & E. will write you. I am thinking of takeingthe children to the ward party ^on christmas^ to please them but myself wouldmuch rather stay at home I suppose you will have fine timeswith you on Christmas & New years well I hope you willenjoy yourself while you can. I feel that the cares andtroubles of this life are many but time rolls rapidly andI am glad of it. Susan has teased a long time to let her askyou one question at last I gave her permission so she hasdictated all herself. 25th Br. Haywood has kindly sent me wordthis morn that he will take letters or any small package to you I dont thinkof any thing save these letters and Phelps bill that you will need before youcome home.

Last rvr the children E. and myself went to the ward partyand had a very pleasant time wish you could have been there, verymany went to the Hall. I find myself very comfortably situ providedfor this winter I think I should enjoy it much better if the one whoprovided it could partake with us but I shall try to save somethingagainst you come with your new bride, for from a dream that I hadon the night of the 20th about you you had or was about to get one thenyou spoke of the &c. The man that spoke to you about threshing thewheat called to do it but I told him he must wait untill you comehome. My children are as kind and good to me as children couldpossibly be with the exception of Susans & Bula's freakes they have alltaken turns with me in family prayr ever since you left Emmawanted to be excused but I told her she could not if she staidwith me. The children have all dictated their own letter as you willperceive I have not read one of them yet.

 Brother W. Woo^d^ruff.Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire-cted to Bishop Partridge, Presidents Joseph Smith Jr, SidneyRigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the Saints in Zion, came safely tothem, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of businessnow on their hands, ^and the request of J Smith Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it.You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things inKirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, thatyou viewed those things in their true light. Great has been theafflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our belovedBrotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.In the pastsummer; I Journeyed from this place in company with WmSmith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose ofmeeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival,we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: thesehowever wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leavingKirtland: And ^W^ Parish, who has since become  so [3 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the book^^of Mormon, reveiled religion, [illegible],^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Josephand the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlementwas not of long duration. Soon after this, President HyramSmith and I, left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: andPresident Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ WmSmith, soon followed us to Far West: and during theirabsence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, J. F Bointon, LukeJohnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, [illegible] ^united^ togeather infor the [2 illegible words] ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith andhis company returned on or about the 10th of December;soon after which this [2 illegible words] ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly,renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed,themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Churchof Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught BrJoseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks 
 How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned fromRigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by takingupon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of theChurch of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church,was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again,it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, whichsaith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, andthe greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given tothe people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saintshere alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as theabove prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yetfuture, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.We have of late learned, that pParish, and the most [rest] of this [2 illegible words], ^combination^have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists.I will now Leave Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move-ment of things here, as they are and have been.You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company withElder Groves, made to the Churches in Kentucky and Tennessee, inthe summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature andresult, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poorbleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of theChildren of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundredand fifty dollars, which we delivered unto Wm Phelps & JohnWhitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, insteadof laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleedingZion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerallydid their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishopor High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author-ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land WithChurch funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement,but because they selected the place of the City Far Westand appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to bebuilt on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed andordained a committee to build the same, withoutasking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop,High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under-stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun-ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints ofGod.These two presidents also managed to get the town plottinto their own hands, that they that they might reap the availsariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, withmany other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day ofApril 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishopand his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W.Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time theyadjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the

Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regularpacket ship of the New York & Liverpool line. viz Elders Taylor, Turley & myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock &moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass & set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat.She had on board 15 cabin & 64 steerage passengers & Capt John Rathbone, 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter & 26 sailors, making109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind & sail well. 21st stift breeze & fair wind most allon board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, & myself some sick, a high wind through the day & a high gale atnight, Boat rocked & pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough & winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high & asrough as the Hills & valies of Kirtland. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feetabove us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, & I got vary wet, & as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat ondeck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, & though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the morning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose & we sailed well 26th A rough sea & strong Breeze. 27th fairwinds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Blackfish & porposes. 29th pleasant morning & high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi-culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, & trunks were tumbling about the cabins. Thiswith the noise of the Officers, & sailors reefing & taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds & rushing wavesmade much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their isnot much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing [P]illows which are magestic) for oneis frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, & must be crouded thicktogether in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm &c. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls alongrough sea, blustering, cloudy, & high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 dayswe have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair & good breezesail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from Halifax 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past herwith great speed. 4th Fair weather & wind, stiff Breeze & fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs & sheep on board.5th rough sea, high winds, & rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm & pleasant evening which we spent on deckviewing the stars & Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a numberof fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from Leith Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days atsea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloatfrom the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy & cold. smooth sea & fair breeze. We are about enter-ing the St George s channel. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle & after straining oureyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the Irish Coast lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irishcoast, & also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, & rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the lighthouses &c. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side^the^ coast &^of^ wales on the other. their was a great bustle & noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds & waves &c. Wereached the pilote ground at daylight & raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appea[r]ed & came along side & sent a piloton board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had notyet arived & she left New York 5 days befor[e] we did. & that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool & she leftNew York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first timethat they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner commun[ic]atedbefore the steam ship Liverpool [here] in sight behind us & was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to beunreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale & we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had notsailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight & an English steamBoat soon came & took us in tow & soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stoodthousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed& fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. & Also the packet ship Independance came in in a fewminutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, & Independance shouldall reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days & the other 10 before the Oxfordbut so it was  Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health & spirits & for the first timeI began to tread the soil in Old England. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. & visited some of the most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, &c. all of whichwere splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, & vegitables that I ever sawThe Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelson sMonument is all of Brass about 14 feet high & 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chainaround their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day.Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns [FIGURES] in his hand, & death stands by his side partly coveredwith a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument thoughthere are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is muchNoted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, & garnishing the out side of the buil--ldings in the cities & towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings arefar more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of theirbuildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the wholehemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, & gases, that rise from the dens population & burning of coal &c., the airis vary heavy & bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstandingEngland is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York toLiverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at St Pauls Church, St Thomases Church which is the church of England I thought it varysingular to hear the Rector's, & Curit s preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof & professing religion withouthaving the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting atPitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite co[z]y & simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were 
 quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thinghas attracted my attention while visiting public places in England ie a great plainness of dress with both rich & poormale & female, their cloth may be equally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appearas tasty & flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposittheir dead in vaults in the church yard & them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms apavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in & out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to betaken from the ship & go to the custom House & by examined by the Officer. & after much jaming, crouding and rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks & baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books &papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at Liverpool for preston. & for the first mile the cars  run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings & inhabitants were over our heads. The carsrun rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & I soon had Elder W. Richards by the hand & it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to oncemore behold this Brother face to face & all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in conversation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to & from thethe factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I shouldthink were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house inPreston on Jan 17th & the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's John Tailor & Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool &Elders Hiram Clark & Wm Clayton labour in Manchester & Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston & its neighbourhood & WillfordWoodruff & Theadore Turley go to the Potteries & warn the People in that place & then inquire the mind of the Lord & if it is his will goto Birmingham. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons & Birmingham 300,000 & the place is larger than New york& is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston & in company with Elders Turley andClark took the rail car & rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton & many Saints.Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls & is as large as New york on the ground. It already has aChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members & the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cottonmanifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brotherto visit a sister possessed with the devil & a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage & required 3 or 4 mento keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her & commanded the devil to come out of her in the name ofJesus Christ & also rebuked the fever & after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, & the fever left her, & she was come [calm]& composed. The devel entered into her child next morning & made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child & rebu[k]edthe devil in the name of Jesus Christ & he instantly came out & the child fell asleep, & the woman attended meeting during the dayI do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19thSunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in Englandthe people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which werehealed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester & in company with Elder Turley took coach& road (on the outside as the custom is) through Stockport, Mackelsfield, Congleton, Tunstell, & to Burslem at the Potteries & spent the night with Elder Alfred CordenThis is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare mostof the English china, crockery & stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordonhe went 40 miles to recieve the work & be baptzed & was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in aweek for his daily bread & preaches evry evening in a week & 3 times on Sunday & he has alredy a little flock of Saints of66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order & dissipline; the Saintshave the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to theirteachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, & my prayer to God isthat all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon & labour while the day lastfor I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders Mullenner & Wright are in Scotland have beganto preach & to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, & the doctors told him to take medicine& keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick & soon got well. persecutiondoes not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks & candles flung at their heads while preaching &occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of Stoke Elder Turley followedme two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem & Elder Turley in Hanley. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded & att[en]ti[ve]congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have foundit to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us willgo there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from thepotteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns & vary populous & whare they have not as yet herd theword at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of makingBirmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England & contains a large number of inhabitants & will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries & Birmingham. & we have already given out appointments partof the way. My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey & of the country&c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times & the vineyard of the Lord in this Easterncountry. Signs, wonders, & fearful sights are appearing, & the words of the Ancient & modern Prophets are fulfillings in this landEearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be inthe heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford s bog land rose up from its mighty bed & travled with the rapidity of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over & in addition to these & many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousandsof people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in thegovernment they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen & parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia toto protect them, & they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going th[r]ough the streets beggingBread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories & out of Employ & bread in one day, & I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting what to do, & in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity & sin as well as trouble & distress& it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may gothrough. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &c.for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhortthe Saints to be as quiet as possible & be subject to the Laws of the Land & the powers that be. but it requires the greatest of prudence & wisdom to hold public meetings & do the work of God in this country at the presenttime & under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe & must spedily be 
 be reapted if the wheat is sowed. & God is a[s]sisting his servents in this country, & the work is begining to roll forth more & more whare it is faithfully proclaimed & signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in London, Liverpool, Birmingham & that all of the capitol places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth to come forth from some quarter & they appear willing to hear, receive & imbrace it when it comes unto them & while we are preaching & baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to preach & baptize in Scotland & thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedilythat truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week & several times on the Sabbath & baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in Burslem to a crowded congregation & a man came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon-ism unveiled W Parish s letters P. P. Pratts letters, signed Luke Johnson, & John F Boyanton [Boynton]. &c &c I was informed the man was a Methodist preacher & brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him to read it what we could by giving him lights, & water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injuryI answered him when he got through, & the people herd my answer with attention. All stories & reports that were afloat in America are now going the rounds in England, but they will ownly stir the people up to come out & hear &c. but I will leave this part of the subject. I have many things I wish to say to you, but you see that I have touched upon a variety of things appertaining to my journey, the country & the vineyard of the Lord &c in this land. B[u]t I will now say that I feel exceding anxious to hear from you by some means or other, yes my desire to recceve a letter from you is vary great. for I have never recceved but one letter from you since I left Montrose the 8th day of last August, I have written 7 or 8 letters to you since I left you how many of them you have obtained I know not. I feel vary anxious to hear from you & Sarah Emma & also about the Church around you, perhaps you mayhave written some letters that may be on the way that I may yet get I hope this is the case. I want you to write as soon as you get this, wont you & give me an account of all matters & things with you & Sarah, how your health is, & how you get along for help; food & rament, is their war between Missouri & Ioway, tell all the news of a National character, I herd New Orleans was destroyed by the Mississppi River is it so, how is the Saints getting along in Montrose, Lovely Street, & Commerce tell me all about it. are they publishing the times & Seasons. give my respects to all the friend[s]in Lovely Street, Mo[n]trose, & Commerce as far as you have an opportunity. Elder T[aylor]  [page torn]  sent a letter home [to] [page torn] his family a few days since in Commerce. I expect Elder Taylor h[as] [page torn] written to his family by this time. Remember me to all of our friends unto who you [page torn]write. I shall not have time to send many as lengthy letters as this to America, but I shall endeavour to give you an account of all important matters with me. & I hope you will write to [m]e a[s] often as you can conveneintly please drect your next letter to Mr Willford Woodruff in care of Alfred Cordon ^Club Buildings^ Navigation road at Mr Godwin s works, Burslem, Staffordshire England. It is a long direc^t^ionI know but it is my place of address at present, please pay the postage to New York or it will not comebut if paid there it will come safe. I will also pay the postage on the letters that I write to you as far as N.Y. also. I will direct this letter to Commerce Illinois & diret the post Master to inform you of it I do this lest their should be some difficulty about the post Office at Montrose. I do not value the writingof a lengthy letter letter like this if you ownly obtain it. & I do pray my heavenly Father that you mayobtain this letter. & that it may n[o]t [page torn] be written in vain. Phebe I hope I shall continue to share in your prayers, remember me consta[n]tly [page torn] at the Throne of grace that I may have Wisdom, grace, & fa[ith] [page torn] according to my day: & I do pray the Lord to Bless you, with health & strength & suppoort you in the midst of all troubles, trials, temptations, afflictions & distress untill the end come when we mayenter unto that rest together which remains for the people of God. Jan 29th I held a meeting last evening in New Castle & preached to an attentive congregation one offered himself for Baptzm. I have this morning visited the large silk factory in New Castle & seen them make silks from the ball or raw article to the weavers loomwhare ribbons, sattins, & silks, are finished. I have since walked to Burslem 3 miles though Parks, lanes, fields, & while the sun shines beatiful & pleasant, the parks, walks, & fields, are as green as they would be in the month of May in America. I sit down this morning to finish this Letter as I cannot write as lengthy letter as this at once for I am broke of by many calls, so I have had several spells about it. & now Phebe wont you sit down & do so by me give me a kind of a journal or history of all things with you [&] Sarah. E. since I left you ie if you are able, gita large sheet & fill it full. I want to know about the sickness & who is dead. & what Joseph & Sidney done at Washington& what the prospect is concerning the Church & its progress in America. What news have you from our friendsin Maine remember me to all of Father Carters family when you write. I do not know that you will be able toread all of this letter but make it out as well as you can. please keep this letter & not lose it as I shall wishto see it when I come home. I do not yet know how long my mission will be in England but I calculate tolabour faithfully while I do labour that I may the sooner get through & again meet with my familyBut my Dear Friend & Companion let us try to be resigned to the will of God in all things relative to our seperationfor a season, for it is to do the work of God, to fill a responsible station in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ& warn the people of this generation, & prune the vineyard once more, that the children of God may be pre-  [page torn] [-pai]red for the coming of the Son of Man. & if we are faithful in this great work, & do the will of Jesus Christ & are wise stewards over the things commtted to our charge, the war will soon be ended & the victory won, then howsweet will be our rest, how great our glory, how rich our  reward & how Eternal our happiness. & May the Lord Jesus Christ intercede for us, & all Saints that we may overcome through the Blood of the Lamb that when he comes we may be like him & reign with him upon the Earth which may our Heavenly Father grant for Christs sake AmenI remain forever your Companion & FriendWillford WoodruffPhebe W.

 [sideways text] Orson Hyde Dec 29 1860 [end of sideways text]Hon.[or] W. Woodruff, Moroni Sanpete Co U TDear Brother, Dec 29, 1860.I owe you manyapologies for not earlier answering your kindletter of the 20th Ult. ins I have written to myfamily in the city but once since I left, andhave seen my wife in Sanpete but about threetimes since the President was here. I have been very busy in building me a house and inpreaching the gospel. Away from home I seldomcould find a decent pen, or a half sheet of cleanpaper. I have written a little through necessityand a very little only. I might urge many othrreasons for not writing sooner, but none for wantof a disposition to write. I have not had timeeven to write a love letter, however strong my in-clinations may have been to do so. I never labored with body and mind more intently in my lifethan during the past season. I Am now reducedto the size of a decent man. But my house isso far finished that my goods are pitched intoit, and have left my family to regulate forthemselves while I go to Fillmore where I expect to be on New Years night. I am nowon my way there.Accept my thanks for your Kindattention to my vineyard. It was a swamp 
 Snow at Springtown is about 18 Inches deep andat this place about 6, and only 6 miles apart. We havehad a beautifully mild season until Wednesday last whenthe snow fell very freely and it became intensly cold. We haveno wind storms to do us any serious damage in the countywith the exception of about one third of the roof of the Meetinghouse at Fort Ephraim which was blown off by reasonof a door being left open and the house being tight, it hadto burst. But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustainedby our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that nohuman lives were lost. Speaking of Judgments, the Lordsaid, "My saints shall hardly escape." Sickness and deathare our common lot; and though the summons be directagainst us or our best friends, we have to obey the mandateSickness is only one trial to prepare us for glory, and deaththe gate through which the just enter into it.Bro. Gibson, of whom you speak, is something morethan a political Mormon, I hope. He has an extensivemission. I hope he may do good, he can do no harm to the cause.The road from the North Bend to Spanish Fork is workedthrough for horsemen and empty wagons, but to make ita good and safe thoroughfare, will require very much morelabor. Many of the citizens here have petitioned for anappropriation to work it through. Not, however, by my counselor suggestion, not but that such a measure is desirableto me; but I think the Legislation has appropriated too muchalready for individual aggrandizement with the view ofpublic good. I have counseled the people to forward their 
 Petitions to Hon G. A. Smith instead of forwarding themto a man who, after voting for a measure, turns round andsays, "you can't do any thing it is the height of nonsenseto ask two dollars a bushel for wheat when it can bebought for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter." Wewant men who can do something. "You can't, you can't"never built, even, a house of Commons, let a lone the Kingdomof God. But when stray cattle are required to pay privateliabilities, the tone changes to, "I can, I can." This is no privacy. ItTwo weeks ago today, I preached just such a discourse inManti as I hinted to them that I should th in the second discoursethat I preached there. It made quite a fluttering in some quarters,yet the masses of the people brightened as though ten tuns burthenhad been removed from their shoulders. Many were in tears,others smiled, some as white as ghosts while the power ofGod enabled me to tell things about as existing evidencewill substantiat[e] them. One remarked that that discoursecaused many a drooping branch to lift up its headIt was a faithful warning to evil doers.When a legal Governor vetoes the acts of an illegal Legislature, it is as 'twas; and 'twas as 'tisLincoln is Elected, and God's will in that is done.The times are becoming quite interesting. The Lord help all parties on in the way they want to go.The people are gathered for meeting so I must stopwriting and go to preaching6 o'clock Sunday eveningand all is well. Your Brother in the gospelOrson Hyde 
 P.S. I perceive by the News that Bro Gardner Snow ofManti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He isa very good man; but is completely wraped up in his sonWarren and in George Peacock. The people of Sanpetehave paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvementscan be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. Itis like all improvements in Manti, unfineshed. SeveralBack houses have been begun, but I know not one finishedThe jail in like condition. $4,500 was the contract pricefor completeing it, as I am told, when $2,000 would build andcomplete a much better building than that would be of finishedThe county is greatly in debt, and no improvements that areof much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered,the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has sufferedThe people have suffered by their stoks [stock] being made intostrays and then into beef. The Indian department hassuffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations goingin the same way. The people of Sanpete think theBourbons have reigned long enough, and that BornbasDynasty should end. If the county seat were removedforom Manti to Moroni or to Springtown it wouldsuit the notions of the people much better. If to MoroniM. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown,Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I haveexpressed no opinion here as to the removal of the countyseat, neither any with regard to this choice of a Judgeyet the above are my true sentiments and 19 twentiethsof the people here would endorse them, the opinionof our representative to the contrary notwithstanding 
 Elder W. Woodruff said the only way forthe Committee to do was for them to dojust what Prest. Young wanted them to dolet us unite and cooperate as a people, andturn out our means to relieve Prest. Young,and become part owners of the Railroad --the Lord has blest us, and we are all betteroff, than ever before and let us find out whatour duty is and then do it -- He was willingto do all he could himself &c 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff Strongly recommended thebrethren to exercise Faith and prayer for GovernorChaffer, the Judges and the other members of the ring.& that the Lord would overrule their acts for the good ofIsrael. 
 Elder W. Woodruff regarded this school was one of the greatestpriveleges the Elders can enjoy we are taught herehow to build up the Kingdom of God we can seethe hand of God in inspiring his servant Brighamin opening this school, the Cooperative movement&c which soon developed a secret of plot of apostacyAnd which had been revealed to Prest Young some timebefore it was making made manifest.The cup of this Nations iniquity will soonbe filled up, and the judgments of God will breakit to pieces.He then read a little from page 79 Doc & Cov.and by making comparisons with what is foundin the Bible, Book of Mormon & Doc & Covr. pertainingto Father Adam, as to ^who^ he was &c, we can learnmuch that will strengthen our faith & comfort ourhearts.Dad by day the Gentiles who are constantlycoming up to Zion, are fulfilling the scriptures. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said the Lord intends to build up Zion, but the enemy is so far on the alert, that we may expect to be met on all sides. the Land question is very important, and should not be neglected, or we will suffer by it. Ours is a constant warfare, and has been from the beginning. we have got to watch and guard ourselves, lest the enemy gets an advantage over us.4God was going to build up Zion on this Land and we ought to carry out the counc^i^l of his Servants. We had got to Labour, and cease to sustain the enemies of our God.Though the Government, through its Officialsare seeking to destroy every constitutionalright, and deprive us of them, they will certainly find it a dear bought effort, for if we do our duty, God will frustrate their plans, and bring them to shame. 
 He hoped every Elder & boy in Israel, will have agood rifle and ammunition, all in readinessto defend ourselves and families, that God andAngels may see that we are willing to doanything that is required of us but He for one had great Faith in prayer let every saint bear up before the Lord thosewho are in our midst seeking to destroy ushe believed God will not only hear, but answerthe prayers of his Saints, which are offered upin earnestness & faith. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff said we have not sufficiently realized our responsibilitys as parents or members of the church, though he himself had always been used to work, and his wives and children also had to work and be industrious, it was not right for us to allow our children to be out late at night, and mingle with evil associations. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff had visited Fort Herriman preached there, and attended a party  He bitterly complained of conduct which he had been eyewitness to in Bp Gardners ward ^at a party^and was sorry that Bp Gardner was not presentto day Bishops ought to be the most honest of any people in the Territory and especially those who have charge of cooperative stores, and not permit their wives and daughters to draw goods out of the store without Keeping out any account of it Bp Gardner ought to be had before Bp Hunterand tried for such conduct in permitting such deviltry to exist in his ward. 
 they should be taught to respect and honour their parents.He was truly thankful for the institution of Sabbath Schools, and our children should be sent thereto learn the principles and doctrine of Christ.Some of us will soon pass away, and the responsibilities of the Kingdom of God, will fall upon the heads of our children, therefore they should be instructed in everything that pertains to the government of God. Zion will conquer, and prevail, and our duties ^which^ are ^of^ the most various kinds, if we will only attend to them,we shall gain an experience that will qualify us for increasing usefulness. We should teach our wives, (in our absence) to pray with their fachildren, and teach them to be honest.also, that when they find anything, it is not theirs, but seek to find the owner.We have been greatly blest, and softened the hearts of men in our behalf in times past,and if we do right, God will give our ^us^ power to retain our possessions and keep the balance of power in this city. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  sanctioned the remarks of the previous speaker, said no one living in the Zion of Enock would make promises and not fulfill them, and before we can enter into the order of Enock, we have got to practise the principle of righteousness 
 Elder W. Woodruff was glad to hear the voice of Prest Young's voice again, to listen to his councils - the Spirit of God had been with Prest Wells hduring his absence. He also refered to the wicked world who are much opposed to the Kingdom of God as ever, there [h]as been a strong combination among the wicked to bring us into trouble during the past winter, but we have been preserved, and have met in our School, Tabernacle & Ward Houses, without interruption. It was also a wise sugges-tion of Prest Young to introduc^e^tion the use of oxen for during much of our labour instead of Horses as a source of economy.He also named a few things about the mines.the hand of the Lord was in it, and much good would come out of it. Let farmers cultivate the soil, and every mechanic cleave to his mechanism 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we should watch and pray and especially deposit our votes on Monday next, and use every means to influence others do the same. 
 if every man would fulfil their their promises to each other, confidence will be increasedboth Joseph Smith & prest. Young have taught us the principles of Honesty and Integrity and we should try to carry them out.The rules of the School are just and good,and we should observe them.We cannot be saved in the Celestial Kingdom of God, unless we practise principles of righteousness & Honesty it does not pay any of us to do wrong He teaches hischildren to be honest, and he believes they will grow up as Honest men.We must not encourage our children to do wrong, if we do, they are lit almost sure to make it manifest as they grow up.Let us set good examples before our wives and children.He then recommended the brethren to get up what Horses or Cattle they have over Jordan, if not, we shall certainly lose them, for their is no feed for them there.Put them in Cooperative Herds where they can be taken where proper care of 
 by and bye, we shall see the wisdom that God has in permitting them to be opened here & thereHe had been absent a few days looking out a Herd ground for a Cooperative Herd, and hoped the brethren would rally round the effort and help it along.Zion will arise, and triumph on the face of the earth, and all opposition will have to give way, and the Kingdom will be built up. We must attend to our prayers, and our works must be good, and we shall have a home here, and the wicked and ungodly will have nopower to prevent it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff felt thankful that he lived to see the commencement of a grand cooperative movement, which he had no doubt would continue until it circumscribed the whole of our temporal matters. We should learn to sustain ourselves, and leave off as fast as possible the patronage of our enemies. Let alone those who support our bitter enemies. He heartily endorsed this movement, and prayed that we might grow brighter and brighter. Motioned & Seconded, & CarriedThat the Constitution be accepted and the Books be opened for subscription. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said the nearer we get to the Lord, the more mercy we see displayed towards erring humanity - hence it is that Prest Young entertains the most mercifulfeelings towards those who have done wrong and would gladly assst towards reclaiming them. And he for one did not feel like saying anything to oppose it 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff Gave out a notice of a 1/4 Sec. of land in the Pulsipher field, and requested all landowners of that 1/4 Section to meet at the close of the School, as some-thing had to be done, or the land would be lost. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said, our success as a people depended on our faithfulness in keeping the commandments of God.Neither the Ancient Saints, nor the latter day Saints can obtain ^the^ blessings of God on any other principle.No principle was ever revealed to the Sons of Men, but what was intended for their observance.He believed their was sufficient integrity however ^among the saints^ who are doing their best in obeying the laws of God, to preserve us from the hands of the wicked.He had great faith in Prayer, and re-commended the school to bear up continually before the Lord, the anointed of God.told up He once heard a simple, fervent prayer offered in Circle by the Prophet Joseph when in deep trouble, and was answered in three days.We should also pray for our enemies,for if ever any poor devils needed praying for, the Judges, Lawyers, &c in our midst needed it. Let us be valient for the truth and stand up like men in the cause of Zion 
 Elder W. Woodruffrecommended us to travel in travelshallow water, and not to trouble ourselves about the mysteries that are all around us- spoke of the increase of infidelity among the nations of the world.Let any one deny the Holy Ghost and the atonement of Jesus Christ, then the Devil leads them to lead shed innocent blood. 
 Elder W. Woodruff gave a graphic account of his experience with a very severe Snow Storm, on his way from Randolph to Evanston, having to travelsome 15 miles in the Storm, and after a very providential opening, he reached Ogden, and finally to this City, in health and strength, for which he acknowledges the hand of the Lord.It is our duty to trust in God, be diligent,and faithful & true in all our duties to God and each other, and the Kingdom will be established in spite of all the opposition that is now arrayed against it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said ever since he was a little boy, he never could think there was anybody on the earth that loved the Lord, unless there was a Head and body of the Church, which is so beautifully exprest by the Apostle Paul.He had observed a greadt many cripples in his life, some lacking one limb and some another- but he never say ^saw^ any without a Head- so with the Christian world, having no Head, are without life, just as much as a natural body, without a Head  one. He was not at all surprised at the persecution we are receiving, he was astonishedthat we did not have more, but God will bring us off victorious. Since we had openly come out with the principle of Polygamy, God had thrown a shield around us, and protected us. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said the Lord never fails in any promise that he gives to the children of men. He deals with men in on the most broad democratic principles. The Law that God has revealed to us in this day, is easily understood by the most illiterate this Law of the Gospel was given that man might be brought back into his presence, and exalted in the Celestial Kingdom, but the human family must abide the Law, as or they cannot gain the promise. He felt to rejoice that Prest.Young was here with us again when he was first arrested, he said, that all their efforts would turn out a great fizzle the Prayers of the servants of God have prevailed, and God has delivered those ^who^ were inbonds. We should never lose sight of the promises,and so live, that we can lawfully claim them.When Pres.t Young first set foot on this temple block, he put down his cane upon it and said, Here the greater Temple of God will be built.No man who has l ever lifted up his hand against this Kingdom, as ever pro^s^pered. No weapon that was ^is^ formed against Zion can prosper. this prophecy has been most remarkably fulfilled.We shall prosper, if we keep the commandments of God-the Hand of God has been over us as a people. 
 The Nation we live in, has become corrupt with Whoredoms, Thieving, & every foul crime that will shortly sink it to perdition. It may be that the highest tribunal in the land, viz The Supreme Court, may also be induced to turn against us -- the President has tried his hand, and perhaps Congress may legislate against us -- but the Lord willbring us off victorious. And this nation will fill up the measure of their iniquity. 
 souls into the Church than any one man in the Church; I do not know howthat is. I brought two thousand into the Church in the south of England-in Herefordshire, &c., in 1840; but I never felt to boast or to take anycredit to myself in any of these things, for it was God not WilfeordWoodruff that did it. Yet I felt it was a great blessing to be aninstrument in the hands of God of performing siuch a work. So I look uponyou young brethren who are sent now to the nations of the earth to preachthe gospel and save the souls of men.  No greater or more glorious workcould you be called to.  Therefore, my dear brother, take hold with allyour might. Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer for the Holy Ghost tobe with you to give you power to preach the Gospel and give you souls insearch of your ministry, and the Lord will hear your prayers and giveyou power to accomplish a good mission which will be a satisfaction toyourself and your friends and acceptable unto God who has called you.And this applies not only to yourself, but to every Elder with you, andall who are in the vineyard of the Lord. Therefore, fear not, but laborfaithfully to prune the vineyard once more for the last time and preparethe earth for the coming of the Son of Man. Avoid all evil, resist alltemptations, and the angels of God will be your constant companions.Give my love and blessing to Prest. Naegle and wife and all theElders with you. I am interested in the welfare of every Elder laboringin the vineyard of the Lord.Spencer Clawson's wife died last week, and will be buried onSunday. I would be glad to hear from you and know how you are gettingalong. Sister Woodruff, Blanch and Alice join me in love to you and Bro.and Sister Naegle.From your Brother in the Gospel, Wilford Woodruff

 De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontorfor den skandinaviske Mission.Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.Kjebenhavn, Sept. 12 1893.President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake CityDear Brother:When I was appointed to take charge of theScandinavian Mission, May 1st Bro. JosephChristiansen turned over to me as "Resources," a list of notes due this Offise from parties nowin Utah, which notes, according to your suggestionshad been sent to you for colection, in order tohelp this office out with the much neededfunds.  I write this by way of a reminder.I will also state, that during the last few monthsbut very little money has been sent from home, tothis office for Emigrations; The few emigrantsthat has goen this summer, has mostly goenon money that has been to thier or here for a longtime, and as stated above, but very little hascome from home to Reimburse the office.  Wehave had several calls from home for money, thathas been sent here for Emigrations, but when theparties, for whom it was intended could not go "atonce", the money was recalled.  I suppose becauseof the hard times at home and the scarcity of money.All this has drained us interely and we arenot now able to remit to Liverpool the fullamounts for the emigrations as they go.  If

Sal.Kjebenhavn, _____, 189_____we had the cash which these notes representsthen we would be allright as far as theemigrations is concerned.  I expect Prest.Lund over here next week and I shall thentake great plasure in showing him thecondision of the mission financily,  I hopeto hear from you favorably on this matter.The work of God is progressing in thislands, many are investigating the Gospelafpecialy in Norway and Sweden and if weonly had more missionaries to send upthere much more good could be done.I remain yours in the Gospel of christC. A. CarlquistBro. Jack sayes, we are doing the best wecan to collect those notes, but in these hardtimes, no one seems able to pay,  and thereis but little hope of getting the money just now.Besides the Copenhagen office has drawn on the Lpool office and the latter has drawnon this office, and will no doubt continueto do so.J.

Brother Anderson came here last May and was according to your wish, sent to the City of Stockholm, where he gained admittance to the best school in this country for the study which he was to pursue Figure Molding. When Prest. Lund and I visited Stockholm conference last fall we had several talks with brother Anderson and learned that he was progressing very rapidley, using every opertunity offered for study.
