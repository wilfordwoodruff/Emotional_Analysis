 was again taken with another writ and was to be tried in  Illinois. On this night Brigham Young also dreamt that  we were called home.  At Cincinnati I shipped 30 reams of  paper for the Times and Seasons and we spent the interval  to the 22nd in visiting the Saints and Branches near; and then left for Pittsburg on board the Adelade for Pittsburg where  we arrived on the 27th at 6 o'clock p.m.  There was a meeting that night in the  city at the Temperance Hall to which we repaired and  about the first persons we saw were Elders H. C Kimball and Orson Pratt. We heard the voice of John E. Page  preaching as we entered. He hammered the sects during his discourse and at the close he informed the  people of our arrival which made six of the ^Twelve^ in the  city.  Next day our quorum held a council  and Brigham its president enquired concerning the  proceedings of the Twelve at Cincinnati, and found  that elders Kimball O. Pratt and John E. Page held  a conference and organized the Church there and  their Elders Pratt and Kimball left for Pittsburgh  but Elder Page stayed behind & in a few days  disunited what he been done and reorganized the  Church  President Young reproved John E. Page  for undoing what three of the quorum of the Twelve  had done together and spoke also of Joseph's counsel to be gentle and mild in our teachings and not  to battle with the sects but win the affections  of the people.  Pittsburgh resembled the English  cities in consequence of the burning of so much  stone coal which covered the ^city with the^ the dustiness of the smoke Its population was about 35,000 it had 120 preachers 95 churches and 21 denominations and the Branch the Branch of the Church of Latter-day Saints numbered  seventy-five souls. 
 Sunday the 30th six of the quorum of the Twelve  met at Temperance Hall in Pittsburgh with the Saints In the morning I addressed the meeting followed by  G. A Smith; in the afternoon John E. Page and Orson Pratt, and in the evening H. C. Kimball followed  by Brigham Young.  Items from Brigham Young's Remarks  Among many other things he said  "Why do the people oppose the gifts and graces? If a man can get faith by the power of God and  the gift of the Holy Ghost so as to lay hands  upon his wife and children or friends when  they lie sick and languishing nigh unto  death and command the fever or disease or  even death itself to depart and the person is  releived I ask what harm is there in all this? Or if a man by faith and humility before  God can get the testimony of Jesus and prophesy  of things to come or speak in tongues or cast  out devils I ask what harm in all this? Does it do any harm? No it does not.  I know the New Testament  is true; for I have proved it according to  the pattern given by beleiving in Christ  obeying the Gospel and knowing the signs  do follow. Then I ask do these things harm any one? No they do not."  In speaking of the Kingdom of  God he said  "The Kingdom must be  together; the people must be gathered into 
 one place. For how would the King of France or England succeed in undertaking to reign over a Kingdom when the  people were scattered all over the world except in France or England. They could not reign over a people unless  the people were with those kings to reign over  So with the Saints. They must be  gathered together and this work has already commenced  And who is the author of this work and gathering? Joseph Smith the Prophet as an instrument in the  hands of God is the Author of it. He is the greatest man on earth. No other man of this age has  power to assemble such a great people from all the  nations of the earth with all their varied dispositions and assimulate them and cement them together so that they might be subject to rule and order  This the Prophet is doing; and that which makes  a great king president or man is to have a great  people to rule over."  Next day our quorum assembled and took  a tour through the city. We visited Curling's Glass Works and saw them work through each  branch of the manufacture; we then went to the  bluff above the city and had a view of the new  Basin to be filled with water forced from the  Alleghaney River to supply the city below of  which we had a fair view.  Descending the hill we had a  view of the city water works. The building was  after the Roman order cost two hundred thousand dollars  and was designed and executed by Elder Charles Beck a member of the Church of Latter-day Saints  Afterwards we visited Miltonburgers  Ironworks through each of its branches and saw the  keel laid for an iron steam ship of war. The keel was 140 ft. in length 
 Elder Charles Beck paid 48 dollars for  stage fare of six of the Twelve to Baltimore and  a collection was taken up of about 20 dollars to  assist us to Philadelphia at which place we  arrived on the 5th of August. having left Pittsburgh on the 3rd.  On the ^Sunday^ afternoon of the 6th which  was Sunday we met in the Canaanite Church  about 300 Saints. Elder Grant opened the meeting  and ^which^ President Brigham Young addressed the meeting at considerable length. Among other  things he said  "A man or a woman may  ask of God and get a witness and testimony from  [word erased] concerning any work or messenger sent  unto them; but if a person asks for a thing  that does not concern him such as governing  the Church &c he will not get an answer and  if he does it will not be from God"  He also remarked in conversation upon the enquiry of, Who had the ^fulness of the^ Melchisidec Priesthood that if any in the Church had it  he did not know it. For a person to have  ^the fulness of^ that Priesthood he must be a King and a  Priest. A person ^He^ might have a portion  of ^it^ that Priesthood the same as the governors or  Judges of England have power from the King to  transact business but he is ^they are^ not the King  of England. A person may be anointed  King and Priest before he receives his  Kingdom &c.  In the evening Orson Pratt preached, followed by remarks from George  A Smith. One the morning of this  Sabath I went with Elder Young and others  to a Millerite Meeting. Here we heard  a Mr Litz preach a sermon destroying the  literal return of the Jews and rebuilding of Jerusalem 
 Two days afterwards the Twelve and  about 150 Saints took an excursion on board a steamer  As we glided over the water we passed the new frigate  Rariton of sixty four guns and reached Gloster Point were we spent the day in feasting fishing swinging walking singing and discussing various subjects  One of the subjects which arose  for discussion was, "Is the prosperity of any religious  denomination a positive evidence that they are right?"  Elder John E. Page contended for  the affirmative and Elder J. M. Grant for the negative  Brigham Young the chairman decided that the prosperity of any people was no positive evidence  of their being right.  We returned to the city and  during the evening my mind was deeply exercised  with the impression that my wife was in distress  or afflicted. I prayed for her before the Lord  and my mind was releived  During the week we held meetings  several times and visited public places.  On one of the days Elders Young  O Pratt G. A Smith myself and P. Hesse visited  the State House, and on the top of the steeple we  had a fine view of the city of Philadelphia Descending to the Indipendance Hall we saw the  place where the Patriots signed the Declaration  and sat in the chair in which John Hancock sat in at the time he signed that instrument  Next day we visited various parts  of the city especially Peel's Museum where among many  other things of note we saw and examined the body  of the Mermaid and the skeleton of a Mamouth  On the 14th I parted from the  Philadelphia Saints and in company with Elders  Orson Pratt and Wm Moor took steamboat to  Skoolkill and then walked 6 miles to Mr. Mosley's  and preached in the evening followed by O. Pratt 
 We journeyed 27 miles the next day and  during our days ride we passed over the ground of  the Brandywine Battle saw where the action commenced  w[h]ere the Americans retreated and a part of them surrendered  and saw also where Washington led away the remainder  of the army  The day after Elder Moor and  myself travelled 25 miles to brother John Neffs in  Strasburgh and found him disposed to sell his  property and go to Nauvoo and take stock in the  Nauvoo House or Temple On the way we passed by  Bishop Edward Hunter's former residence and found the country throughout this region exceedingly rich  and fertile  We continued our journey on  the succeeding day to West Nantmeal and on  the next in the evening met with Elder Pratt  and others and held meeting at West Nantmeal Seminary and the day after commenced a two  days meeting 12 miles distant in a grove in  Uwchland Township  The second day of our camp  meeting was Sunday August 20th. A good  congregation came together and I addressed them  in the forepart of the day from the text "If  our Gospel be hid it is hid to them that are  lost" &c. [##2 Corinthians 4:3##]  In the afternoon Elder O Pratt  delivered a powerful discourse from ##Revelation 22:3|Revelations  22 ch 3rd verse## "And there shall be no more  curse.["] He began with the fall and  traced his subject through to the Millennium the  Second Advent the binding of Satan and the  New heaven and the New earth when Christ shall  deliver the Kingdom up unto his Father and the  last enemy Death be destroyed.  Next day we returned by  rail to Philadelphia where we met Elder Grant 
 but found that the rest of the Twelve had left the city for  New York where we followed them two days later.  Conference at New York held August 26, 1843.  The quorum of the Twelve met the Saints  in Conference at New York on this day  After prayer President Young opened  the buisness of the Conference by an interesting address upon the subject of the gathering, the Priesthood and the  building of the Temple and Nauvoo House.  In the afternoon Elder Kimball spoke very graphically in parables; and Elder George A. Smith followed with anecdotes. One related to  his collegiate education received from the Prophet which  was to preach short sermons and make short prayers  Remarks of President Brigham Young  Elder Young next spoke; and among other remarks  he said  "The Scriptures have been mistified  to that degree that the greatest divine of the day is  as ignorant as the dumb ass concerning the things  of God. They know not their right hand  from their left and we are trying to reverse it  by making the things of God so simple that  the people can understand  Place a man in this room who  is ignorant of science and take everything out that  we can see and then ask him if there is anything  in the room. He will say no nothing but  us two. I tell him there are millions of live animals in the room and that even we breathe them 
 and I will show him by the aid of the m that there are live animals in one drop of water  eight feet long but he will not beleive me until  he sees it through the magnifying glass.  So with the unbeleiver. He  does not beleived in God in angels in spirits because he does not see them but let him have  spiritual glasses or let him obey the commandments  of God and get the Spirit of God and then  he can see."  The following was also given  Interesting Questions & Answers  1st. Ques. Can any oficer in a Branch of the  Church say his word is law and should be  obeyed?  Ans.: No.  Ques. Is it right for a Priest to be joined to  a Teacher in visiting the houses of the members  when their duty is set forth in the Book of  Doctrines & Covenants?  Ans.: Yes any officer from an High  Priest to a Deacon may visit the Church and  be set apart for this purpose.  Ques.: If Elders or High Priests are  on an Island and cannot get word from the  Prophet or the Twelve may they get revelations  concerning themselves?  Ans.: The Twelve may get a  revelation concerning themselves. They may  get a revelation in any part of the world  concerning the building up of the Kingdom  as they have to establish the Kingdom in  all parts of the world. So any person  can ask the Lord for a witness concerning  himself. He can obtain an answer for 
 himself but not to lead the Church. That belongs to  the head of the Church."  Ques.: Can a Church make by laws  as an expediency for themselves which are not specified  in any revelation  Ans.: Yes if they wish they may make laws to stick their fingers in their eyes.  Ques.: When any person is ordained  legally by vote of the Church to any office can he  be released from that office and Priesthood and hold  his standing in the Church  Ans.: No.  On the following day Conference was  continued. Meeting was opened by singing and  prayer by Elder Grant after which Elder Woodruff delivered a discourse from the ##2 Peter 1:20-21|2nd Epistle of Peter 1st ch., & 20, 21 verses##.  Elder Kimball followed with  some appropriate remarks and in the afternoon  John E. Page gave a lengthy discourse proving the  divine mission of Joseph Smith and the truth  of the Book of Mormon.  In the evening Elder O. Pratt delibered a masterly discourse upon the Book of  Mormon. He said it was the history of  nearly one half of the Globe and of the people who  had inhabited it that it gave the history  of all the cities which had since it came forth  been discovered by Cartherwood and Stephens  that it spoke of the establishing of our government  and what is more highly interesting it reveals  its final fate and destiny so that by reading  the Book of Mormon it may be clearly seen  what will befall this nation and what will  be its final end. In that Book is also the  Gospel as taught by Jesus Christ himself to the  ancient inhabitants of America and an account 
 of his ministry amongst them after his resurrection and Assension. This was the pith of his discourse  occupying nearly two hours.  I left New York on the 29th in  company with Elders Davis and Wandell and having  visited Branches on my road I arrived at Farmington my native place on the 2nd of September and  left my fathers house again on the 5th and  on the 8th arrived at the city of Boston where  I found Elder George A Smith and another  brother waiting for me at the station.  Conference  held by  The Quorum of the Twelve at at Boston in Boylston Hall Sep. 9th, 1843.  There were present of the quorum of the Twelve Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt John E. Page Willford Woodruff and George A. Smith  Elder G. A. Smith opened the  Conference by prayer and then President Young called for the business of the meeting after which the  churches were represented  During this conference there  were discourses delivered by all the members of  the quorum of the Twelve present their subjects being chiefly upon the gathering building the Temple and kindred matters. It would be too lengthy to  give the synopsis of the whole of them as recorded  in my daily Journal of the time. The substance  of several must suffice. 
 Parley P. P. Pratt led the van upon the Gathering  and then President Brigham Young further laid before  the Conference the subject and design of this mission  of the Twelve to the eastern churches.  Synopsis of the  Discourse of President Brigham Young  I wish to make a few remarks  concerning the subject of our faith. We hear the  Elders represent the feelings of the brethren concerning  the gathering  The Spirit of the Lord Jesus  Christ is a gathering Spirit. Its tendency is to  gather the virtuous and good the honest and meek  of the earth in fine the Saints of God.  The time has come when the  virtuous and ^Lord has^ determined to fulfill his purposes  "Had we lived in the days of Christ," the people  say, we would have received his work. But judge ye if the people are better now than they were then.  They are not.  When the full set time was come  the Lord came in the flesh to do his work whether  the people were prepared or not. And now the full set time is come for the Lord God Almighty  to set his hand to redeem Israel  We are not bound to make the  people beleive but to preach the Gospel and then  our garments are clear.  The Lord does not require every  soul to leave his home as soon as he beleives  but he requires him to hearken to counsel and  follow that course which the Lord points out  The Spirit of the Almighty and of this work is on the elect ^alert^ and those who keep 
 up with the work must be on the alert also  When the Lord says gather  yourselves together why do you ask Him, what  for? Is it not the principle of the Saints to  mingle together to promote the great cause in  which we are engaged?  Do you say, cannot the Lord  save us as well where we are as to^when^ gathered together? Yes if the Lord says so but if he commands  us to come out and gather together He will  not save us by ^our^ staying at home. Have you  not received the Gospel? Yes. Then do  you beleive what we say. Have you not received  the Holy Ghost by receiving the Gospel which  we have brought unto you? Yes; and thousands have and it stands as a testimony  that God has a Prophet upon the earth  You might have been baptized  seventy times seven in any way except the one  God ordained and pointed out and you would  not have received the Holy Ghost. This also  is a testimony to you.  Are you engaged in the great  work with us? You will say Yes. Can you  do any good? you ^You can^ The sectarian world  send the Bible to the nations of the earth. The  people put in sixpence fifty cents or a dollar into  the box and send Bibles through the world. Then  cannot you do something? Yes.  The Lord requires us to build  a house unto His name that the ordinances and  blessings of his Kingdom might be revealed and  that the Elders may be endowed to go forth and  gather together the b[l]ood of Ephraim the people  of God from the ends of the earth  Can you get an endowment in  Boston? No. And only in that place which  God has appointed. 
 Now query: Could Moses have got the  law had he remained in the midst of the children of  Israel and not gone into the mountain? The Lord said  Go and do so and so. Stand before Pharoah. Pull off  your shoes for the ground is holy &c. [##Exodus 3:5##] Moses obeyed  and obtained the blessing; but if he had not obeyed he  would not have obtained the blessing.  But why query about it at all? Has  the Lord spoken? Yes. Then that is enough. I  do not care whether the people gather or not. If they  don't want to I do not wish to save the people against  their will. I wish you to have your choice either to  gather with the righteous or stay with the wicked.  I would like to have all people bow down to the Lord  Jesus Christ but it is one of the decrees of the Lord  that all persons shall act upon their agency which  was the case even with the angels that fell from  heaven  Now will you help us build  the Nauvoo House and Temple? If so you will  be blessed; if not we will build it alone. And  if you do not hearken you will not have the  Spirit of the Lord for the Spirit of the Lord  is in the gathering.  The Apostles tried to gather  together the people in their day. Christ said he  would have gathered the Jews oft as a hen gathereth  her chicken under her wings; but they would  not [##Matthew 23:37##]  It mattereth not to God and angels whether men hear or forbear. They will carry  on their work for the full set time is come  We care about it. We must build a house and  get an endowment and preach the gospel warn  the people gather the Saints build up Zion  finish our work and be prepared for the coming  of Christ  Now we want to send missionaries 
 to the Islands. Can you do something for them? And  that is not all. We want you to contribute to the  building of the Temple. We want what you have to  spare. But are you affraid that you will not have  enough for yourselves when you get there? How easy  it is for the Lord to take it away from you by  fire and otherwise. E. P. Magin had an ivory  cane. I asked him for it but he did not give  it to me; but he soon lost it and it did neither  of us any good  The Lord can give and take away  Jacob with his faith obtained all the best cattle that  his father-in-law had. [##Genesis 30:35##] Who blesses you and all the  people. God. But do the people acknowledge  His hand in all things. No they turn away from Him and do not acknowledge Him nor realize from whom their blessings flow  Let me tell you a secret. When  the Lord shakes the earth and the hills fall  down and the valleys are exalted then for brass He will bring gold for iron silver and for stones  iron. That you will have no use for gold ^for money^ and ^and gods^ the like as you now have but the Lord will think  as much of it then as now.  Let us have some of your gold  to take to Nauvoo to build the Temple and Nauvoo  House so that when the kings princes and nobles  of the earth call to enquire after the wisdom of Zion we myay have a place to entertain them, and  that the weary traveller may also be refreshed  Is there wisdom in Zion? We think  so; and the world begin to think so. Let the world  come forth and translate the plates that have of late  come forth if they have wisdom to do it.  The Lord intends to take away  the gods of the gentiles. He pulleth down and  buildeth up at his own pleasure. Dont be affraid of a dollar or a hundred or a thousand dollars 
 I would not. I have made sacrifices a great many  times. The Lord has promised a hundred fold and  I have taken this course to get rich to give all  I had, and God has given me many blessings in  consequence. If I have been too bold in asking then be you too bold in giving. Give your all and  God will repay as much again."  In the afternoon Parley Pratt took up  the subject of the morning. He said they not only  wanted the gold and the silver but we want you and your wives and children and all you have  He then spoke of the policy of Joseph in Egypt and closed by saying  "Does the Saints here in Boston know they are identified with the laying of the foundation  of a great and mighty work that is to enclude all the great and glorious purposes of God which  are to be fulfilled in the last dispensation and  fulness of times. And I prophesy in the  name of the Lord that whether the Boston Saints  or who may stand for it or rise against it  that almost numberless millions will celebrate  that day when the foundation of this work was laid."  Elder George A Smith followed  upon the subject of what ^seems^ to the people but small  things in the revelations of God in variosus ages  but showed their great importance in the issue  and instanced the building the ark &c. He  also took up the gathering and treated the meeting  to a spice of common ^sense^ versus the mysteries and  concluded with an illustrative anecdote of how  Elder Kimball was sent for by a certain people  and brought forty miles to preach the mysteries  and the amusing sequel of how he read them  a lesson of practical religion 
 Elder Brigham Young arose and said  "I will ^offer^ an apology for my remarks  in the forepart of the day. Some may think  I spoke very plain but the apology I have to  make is that I will turn Thomsonion docter  and give the composition without sweetening. This  work is all it is my all. If this work does  not live God knows I do not want to live;  and I want you to understand that he that  gathereth not with us scattereth and they that  have tasted the bitter cup feel it  Wake up ye Elders who  have sought to build yourselves up and not  the kingdom of God! Wake up ye who  have daubed with untempered morter. Hearken  and hear me for I say unto ^you^ that if you  do not help us build the Temple and Nauvoo House you shall not inherit the land of  Zion. If you do not help build up Zion  and the cause of God you shall not partake  of their blessings.  Many Elders seek to build  themselves up and not the work of God; but  when any one does this no matter who he  may be ^he will not prosper^ even if one of the Twelve. As to  those of the Twelve and others of the Elders who  have apostatised I have known their hearts & their breathings and known their movements  They thought I did not know much but  I know all about them; and when I see men preaching hte [to] build themselves up and  not Zion I know what it will end in. But  say you I am young. I do not care if  you are young. Do you know what you  are about. If so preach and labour for the  building up of the city of Zion. Concentrate  your means and influence there and not scatter abroad. Be faithful or you will not be 
 chosen; for the day of choosing is at the door.  Why be afraid of a sacrifice? I have given my all many times and am willing  to do it again. I would be glad to hear the Lord say through His servant Joseph, let my servant Brigham give again all he has. I would obey in  a moment if it took the last coat from off my  back"  Remarks of Elder Kimball  Among other things he said  "I speak in parables. I compare  the Saints to a good cow. When you milk her clean she will always have abundance of milk to  give; but if you milk her a little and she will  soon dry up. So with the Saints. If they  do but little in building up Zion they soon have  but little to do with. This was the case  in Cincinnati. I had a dream concerning  the Saints there. I thought I was in a field  of wheat that was stacked up; and we had to  draw it into the barn; but when we came to  open the stack the bundles would all fall to  pieces and it was filled with clusters of rats  and mice who had been eating up the grain I thought that these rats and mice were the  Elders and official members who had been in and laying on the Church living on the wheat,  eating them up instead of building up new churches so that when the Twelve came along  they could not get anything for the Temple or  Nauvoo House or hardly a place to stay the  rats had eaten up the wheat so. We had to  go to the world for a home to stay while we  were there.  We are not polished stones like Elders 
 Babbit Adams Blakely Magin and the like. We  are rough stones out of the mountain and when we  roll through the forest and knock the bark off  the trees it does not hurt us even if we should  get a corner knocked off occassionally. The more  we roll and get the corners knocked off the better  we are; but if we were polished and smooth when  we got the corners knocked off it would deface  us  This is the case with Joseph Smith. He never professed to be a dressed smooth polished  stone but was rough out of the mountains and  has been rolling among the rocks and trees and it  has not hurt him at all. But he will be as  smooth and polished in the end as any other  stone while many that were so very polished and  smooth in the beginning get badly defaced and  spoiled while rolling about."  Elders Parley P and Orson Pratt followed and  then the Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock the  next morning  ^We continued^ Conference the next day which was  Sunday and in the morning I preached a lengthy  discourse from the ##Amos 3:7|3rd ch of Amos verse 7th##.  I left Boston on the 12th of September  at 5 o'clock p.m. in the Express train for Portland and at about 10 o'clock while passing through Chester woots 6 miles south of Kennebunk the engine  was thrown from the track in consequence of a rail being raised eight inches by some designing miscreant The force was such that it drove the engine  about five rods ahead and smashed it to pieces with  the baggage cars piled upon the top of it  One lady was brused but not dangerously  and another was slightly injured. The lives of many  were in danger and it seemed a mystry that so little 
 injary was done. Four cars were filled with passengers and  had not the force of the coll^issin^ been broken by the baggage  cars many lives would have been lost.  The baggage car^s^ was^ere^ soon on fire which  was with difficulty extinguished. The fireman was  thrown about three yrods and escaped with a slight injury  but the engineer Mr Adams from Portland was  burried beneath the pile and instantly killed and the  ruins had to be removed before the corps of the illfated  engineer could be optained. No blame could be  attached to him for the raised rail gave no warning  until the engine and baggage cars were in one pile  of ruins. The unfortunate man left a wife and  one child  A Mr Thomas Hall opened his  house for the passengers and much praise was due  to him and his houshold for their hospitality  I spent most of the night in the  woods and got chilled through  They sent to Portland for another  engine which arrived in time to take us to Portland  in the morning.  Arriving at Portland I furnished the  Editor of the American with  The Account of our Railway Accident  I visited my brother-in-law Ezra Carter and  wrote two more letters giving an account of the foregoing  catastrophe one was to the Editor of the "Boston Bee" the other to Elder John Taylor Editor of the "Times  and Seasons"  On the same day I walke to  Scarbourough and arrived in the evening at the house  of my wife's parents. Father Carter was at New York. I came upon Mother so sudden as she  was walking across the room with a candle that  she was as much surprised as though I had come 
 down from the skies and her first salutation was where did you come from?  This was the first time I had been to  my f wife's parents house without Phebe being with me  and I felt like the dove without its mate. But  after conversing till 9 o'clock with mother and Fabyan my wife's brother-in-law I prayed with them and  then retired to my chamber and there prayed for my  absent companion and our children.  Next day I rode round the country  with my brother-in-law Fabyan visiting our friends  and relations. I called at Mr Millikens and  found Arthur Milliken and his wife Lucy the youngest  sister of the Prophet Joseph. They were both home  sick for Nauvoo  The next two days passed in  family associations and after spending the evening of  the second day in conversing with Faban, Rhoda and mother about Mormonism & I took my light  and went to bed fearing I should no[t] see Father but just as I was about to blow the light out a wagon  drove up and I jumped out of bed dressed and was  soon down grasping the hand of my wife's father. I sat up and talked with him till about 11 o'clock  and I thought both Father and Mother looked no  older than when I saw them before and they were  enjoying excellent health. It seemed quite natural  the next morning to sit at the table with my  wife's parents again but I very much missed  Phebe during this visit. The day after I took my final call upon my friends and relatives  and bade them adieu and then took the  cars and arrived in Boston that night.  The next day after my return  to Boston I called upon George A Smith and  ^brother^ W W. Phelps. In the afternoon I went on  the parade ground and saw the militia in a sham  fight and they made quite a splendid appearance 
 On the following evening I visited the celebrated  phenologist O. S. Fowler of Boston who had examined the heads of the Twelve. He gave me  My Phenological Chart.  Wilford Woodruff:  Is a man of great action both  physical and mental; does up things in a hurry; lets nothing sleep in his hands; great resolution; steamboat speepd; loves his liberty; is not disposed  to be subject to the will or dictations of others; has  great indipendance; difficulties only stimulate him to increased action; goes in for the largest liberty  of the mass and is a democrat of the old school;  prefers utility to beauty and substance to show;  highly social and fond of family and friends; has  but few secrets of his own and tells the plain un- varnished facts; fears but little danger; is not  irressolute but descides and proceeds at once to action; His first thoughts are always best. He does up his  own religious thinking and does not hang his hopes upon  the faith of others. He believes but little without proof;  is a two edged sword if he does not cut one way,  does another. He makes positive friends or positive  enemies; has much severity; is sarcastic; bitter in reproaches; means to do right; feals the  force of moral obligations.

 I took a walk with George A Smith to Charlston on the 22nd. We first visited the Navy Yard of the  United States then the dry dock and next the U.S.  Rope-Walk which we inspected in all its branches  We took dinner and then visited  Bunker Hill Monument. I entered the tube and  was drawn up by steam 2210 feet where I had a  view of all Boston Charleston, Cambridge Chelsea &c and then descended by the same way. Next  came the State prisons with 262 prisoners at their  various branches of business  After seeing each appartment  we returned to Boston where we held meeting which  was addressed by John E. Page H. C Kimball P. P. Pratt Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  Next day ^23rd^ I called upon brother Heber C. Kimball who let me have one hundred dollars  ^on P. P.

Pratt and Erastus Snow were in the car before  me without our knowing it. I parted with them  and they continued homeward  I continued my journey the next  day ^24th^ and on the following I reached Farmington my native place and four days later again  left my father's house and arrived in New York on the next day where I found Elder Brigham Young.  On the 3rd of October I took  steamboat to Philadelphia and in the evening  there met five of the quorum of the Twelve and  other Elders  Next day the others of the quorum  of the Twelve started for Pittsburg I also left for  home on the following day and a large number of  the Saints started per rail from ^Philadelphia^ in  the morning bound for Nauvoo. 
 ^Error see.^ On my journey homeward I made large purchases of  paper &c at [blank]  An Exciting Part of My Journey.  The 19th was one of the most exciting and dangerous day's  journey possible in any persons life and the scenes through  which we passed was full of the grand and awful  Our boat was drawn out of the canal on  cars prepared to run ^on^ the railroad to convey us over the Allegany  mountain  It was a novel scene indeed to see a canal  boat taken apart into four sections loaded with freights and  passengers and hoisted ^on^ a railroad by incline plains into the  air 1500 feet over the highest mountains and then descend  into the valley below in the same way  ^On starting^ Horses were hitched to our cars and they drew  us four miles and a half and then we were at the first incline  plain which we had to asscend. Two cars were fastened  at the top of the plain to the same rope that connected  with ours at the bottom and the engine was stationed  in a building at the sumimit of the plain which  drew up and let down the cars  When all was ready the signal  was given by raising a red flag the engine was  put in motion and the cars started. The first  plain was half a mile long and raised one hundred  and eighty feet. We went up in two minutes  and I was thankful to reach the top for had  the rope broke or the fastning become untied we  should have rolled back to the bottom with a tremendious  crash  Plain No 2 raised 125 feet in half  a mile and our boat rocked badly while going up  but no accident hapened. We then continued on 
 a level until we came to the next incline plain.  Plain No 3. was one mile and a quarter  long and it rose 320 feet which we ascended in four  minutes. Before we reached the top the safety car which was attached to our boat was thrown from  the track which ^and^ dragged many rods throwing the  rope off the wheels. I made a sign to the  engineer who stoped and it was replaced. Here  again we were in danger of breaking the rope which  would have sent us back down the mountain more  than a mile or turned us over into the yawing gulf below. In either case we should have  been dashed to atoms. My hair rose on my  head but having got all things ready we proceeded  on to Plain No 4.  This plain was three quarters  of a mile long and ascended 265 feet. We  reached the summit of this in three minutes but  it looked awful to be thus suspended almost  in the air with such a weight of lives and freight  depending upon a knot, a rope, a pin, an  engine and the care of a man which should either  give way would have dashed us to atoms unles saved by a miracle  We next continued on to Plain No 5 which was 3/4 of a mile long and rose 280 ^feet^  This we ascended also in three minutes which  brought us on to the Summit of the Allegany  mountains four miles from the base and eleven  hundred and seventy feet in height.  I felt thankful to God that  we were on the top of the mountain alive but  we had to descend in the same way that we  ascended. There was snow on the Summit and it was  exceedingly cold. We ran on the top of the mountain  about three miles and then began to descend  There were six incline plains  to descend to the bottom of the mountain the 
 whole of which was attended with equal danger and carelessness  As we came upon the brink of one of them  it was found the men had left the breakers and the cars  were about to run down the horses. The conducter seeing  this hollowed for the man to break but finding no one at the breakers and the cars approaching the incline plain the teamster  liberated his horses as soon as possible and they only just  escaped being run down and the conductor sprang to the  breaker himself and with great exertion barely saved us from  madly running down the plain and being dashed to atoms  I was standing in the cars at the  time and instantly throwing off my cloak prepared myself  for leaping out in case the cars should start down the  plain. In either case it might have killed me but  I knew it was certain death to be dashed downward and  chose the alternative of a desperate chance in leaping out  but through the mercy of God we were stoped at the  very brink  The whole passage across the mountains was a constant scene of danger and I called upon God  in my heart to preserve my life  Even while on a level we were running  on the edge of a precipice hundreds of feet deep over  which if a wheel had broken or run off the track the  cars would have plunged awfully down and made an  end of all flesh on board.  We passed through one tunnel in the  mountain and when we reached the bottom of the incline  plains I felt thankful to God that we were mostly  out of danger but the^y^ put the boat together and started  on the rail with all on board without horse or steam and the railroad being a little on the descent it increased  in speed until it ran at a rapid rate and we  were still in danger of being upset. The train ran  of itself for about four miles until it came to the  canal and here again to finish the day with  danger a train of cars was left in our track and  with all the power that could be exerted on the breaks 
 we just escaped a smash up at last. We finally got  launched into the water again with no bones broken or  lives lost. In conversing to ^with^ the mate in the evening upon the subject of our passage across the mountains  he remarked we were not sensible of one half  the danger we had passed during the day but for  one I was sensible of a great deal at least  Two days after this we arrived  at Pittsburg and I immediately engaged passage  for myself and freight of paper to St Louis started  the same day and met Elder Erastus Snow at  Bever with a company of 50 Saints bound for Nauvoo Next day they took passage on the North Bend and on the Alps  Passing over farther intermediates of my journey I arrived in St Louis re-shipped my freight and reached Nauvoo on the 4th of  November and never felt anyone more thankful  to tread its soil again than myself.  The week after my arrival home  I spent in looking after my affairs and found them  in a bad condition. My house which I commenced  before I left and expected to find reared and with  its roof on I found built only a few feet from  the ground  On the 7th I attended Council  with the Twelve and was appointed with John Taylor Parley P. Pratt and Brigham Young as a committee  to raise five hundred dollars to purchase paper  to print the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.  Sealing of myself and Wife.  November the 19^11^, 1843 Hyrum Smith sealed the  marriage covenant of myself and wife Phebe W. Carter  for time and eternity 
 An Adulterer cannot be saved in the Celestial Kingdom.  According to the Doctrine of Joseph the Prophet  In the High Council on the case of Harrison Sagers for improper conduct offered to a female Joseph in an address said "The Church has not received any license from him  to commit adultery fornication or any such thing but to  the contrary. If any man commits adultery he cannot receive the celestial Kingdom of God. Even if he is saved  in any Kingdom it could not be in the celestial Kingdom."  He said he thought the many who had  been made examples such as John C. Bennet and others was sufficient to show the heineous fallacy of such conduct He condemned it in unqualified terms and warned those  present against such evil or they would surely bring a  curse upon the heads of the guilty.  Joseph afterwards met with the Twelve and he informed us that General Fryeson was in town and  wished an interview with us. He had come for the  purpose of getting a memorial in our behalf written to Congress  Next day Sunday the 26 Presidents Joseph and Hyrum Smith with the quorum of the Twelve  sat in Council with the General and there were read  to him the affidavits of Hyrum Smith Brigham Young P. P Pratt Lyman Wight George W. Pitkin and  Sidey Rigdon  On the Sabbath morning Dec 2nd P. P. Pratt Orson Hyde Wilford Woodruff and O Spencer received their anointings preparatory to farther endowment  On the 7th a messenger arrived  from St Louis informing us that the Governor of Missouri had issued another writ for Joseph and that he was about  to make a demand for him of the governor of Illionis  Joseph had just made a touching appeal  to the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont for assistance in obtaining redress of his wrongs in the persecutions of Missouri. We published it in pamplet form and 
 sent ^it^ to the authorities of the United States  The City Council was ^and^ called to ^and^ pass^ed^ an  ordinance the purport of which was that anyone henceforth  who should come to take Joseph Smith on the old  Missourian difficulties should be imprisoned in the city jaol for life unless pardoned by the Governor  with the consent of the mayor. This was published  in an extra sheet of the Neighbour  A few days after this a man by  the name of Elliot one of the Missourian Kidnappers  who had ran bretheren out of Illinois to Missouri and put them in prison was brought to Nauvoo on a warrant and bound under 3000 dollars bonds  He was also under another warrant for threatening  the life of Joseph and the charge was proved  against him but the Prophet forgave him  and he was discharged. On the case Joseph made  an eloquent speech manifesting mercy towards his  enemies when they were in his power but with  uplifted hands he declared that if Missouri  came against us any more he would fight them  and defend his rights  A warrant was also issued  against Col Williams who was the leader of the  kidnapping affray but he had gathered around  him a mob and swore defiance so the officers  returned to Nauvoo for counsel and assistance  On the 23rd At President Joseph Smith's  I with my wife met with the quorum through  the day in the endowments. Brother and  Sister Morley O Pratt & Sisters Lot ^Fanny Murry^ Phebe W. Woodruff ^Barsheba Smith sister O Spencer & Phelps^ [blank] received their anointing.  Thwo days afterwards was Christmas  day A large party met at the Nauvoo Mansion  and had a splendid dinner and supper; but  I was invited by Elder Alexander to meet at his  house with my family and spend the day with 
 the Tennessee Saints. I did so and there were with  us brother Smoot and his family.  The farther duties of a few days more in  my official calling and in attending to my family affairs  and forwarding the building of my house brought  us to the close of the year  Synopsis of 1843.  Travels  I travelled in thirteen of the United States and  the distance of five thousand one hundred and  seventy one miles.  Meetings  Held twenty six meetings and attended 20 Councils  and Conferences  Baptisms &c  I baptized six persons ordained five Elders blessed fifteen childreen and administered to 25 sick ^and  confirmed ten^  Marriedages  I married two persons  Writings & Reports  I wrote 25 letters received 12 and reported and recorded in my journal seven discourses of Joseph the Prophet and reported and recorded eight sermons of the Twelve  Labours of the Year  My time not occupied on my mission east was spent  mostly in the Printing Office for which I also  while on my mission purchased paper and obtained subscribers.

Dear Brethern:  Answering your favor of 25th ins't. will say: I will take pleasure in carefully following your suggestions.  The brethern are all well and we have appointments for the present week, and we feel that our Heavenly Father is blessing us in our labors.  Asking a kind remembrance to all the brethern and trusting to be favored with your council and blessing at all times. I remain  Your brother,  John W. Taylor 
 COLORADO MISSION.  879 South Corona Street, Denver, Colorado  May 17, 1897.  President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  Elder Franklin D. Richards wrote me under date of May 14, 1897, and wanted to know if the five Eld- ers from the Brigham Young Academy of Provo, spent their summer vacation in the Colorado Mission, if they could or would pay their own expenses. In answer to the same I would say, they are all able and willing to pay their  own expenses.  Should you decide to send the brethern here it woul[d] oblige me if you would send me word to that effect as it would give me time to arrange to receive them, and I can notify each of them before they leave Provo just where to get off train so as to save them exrtra expense in going from Denver to their several fields of labor, which would be probably from $2.590 to $5.00 each.  We had a very pleasant meeting at Overland yesterday afternoon in a grove of trees near the Platte river, after meeting^,^ Mr. Richmond and family requsted baptism. Two ladies and a Mr. Hoover and Wife of Denver, and a Mr. Swigart of Fort Logan have requested Baptism, and we will 
 attend to the matter in the near future.  There are three families that desire to emigrate from Overland to some place in Utah, where they can take up land. They have come to me for advice; would it be proper for me to recommend them to go into the Ashley country in Pres. Bennion stake? If not kindly inform me what is  your desire concerning them, and I will advise them accordingly.  Ashley can be reached by team much easier than any other part of Utah from this place.  The Elders are all well and working faithfully in the missionary field and are being kindly received by the people.  Prtaying God to bless you with health and strength and asking a kind remembrance to all the brethren,  I remain, Your brother in the Gospel,  John W. Taylor  [Joseph Fielding Smith] Under these circumstances it will  be proper to issue calls to the brethren named, (bro. F. D. Richards has the list) to serve as missionaries in Colo. during their vacation, leaving it to their judgment or discretion to decide to accept or not on the con- ditions named that they will bear their own expenses. The church not being in a condition financially 
 to do it. I think it would be as well for bro. Taylor to recommend the parties he names who desire his counsil on the matter to go to Ashley. Bro. Taylor should notify the authorities at Ashley of their intention to go there, if they so decide, and about the time to look for them, so that they may be properly received and looked after.  J. F.

 John W. Taylor Aug. 19 [18]97  Manassa.  Conejas County Colarado Aug 19, 1897  Prest. Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brother:  On Aug 1st Elders Geo H. Brimhall, H. S. Ensign, Charles Mann, David Mann, J. H. Grant, Herbert A. White, Wm C. Clive and I came to Manassa. We spent 3  days in the Kanyon up the Conejas river with 100 of the saints and their friends rusticating and we had a very enjoyable time upon returning to the valley we held meeting in Manassa, Sanford, Richfield, Morgan, Sunflower, Antoneto and Eastdale, at the latter place I ordained Bishop Jensen as per your instructions to Prest. 
 2  Albert R. Smith.  Haveing one week left to spare before con- ference, which convened in Manassa on Aug 14th and 15th I felt a very strong desire to preach the gospel to the gentiles who was liveing among the cities of the saints in this valley. I made my desire known to President Albert R. Smith and councillors and when I told them, I was strongly impressed to go from house to house and visit the strangers and their families in our midst they heartily approved of the suggestion. I called to my assistance several of the sisters we met together with the Presidency of the stake ^and^ Bishop Jackson and pps sisters and we fasted and prayed unto the Lord to give us access to  the hearts of the people and asked our heavenly father to soften the hearts of those whom we went to see, and open their eyes  that thay may see their sins and 
 3  also see the necessity of serving God and repenting of their ^sins^ and unite with the saints in building up the Kingdom of God in this land, and we made covenant that we would fast till the following day. And I stood up among the Elders and the spirit of Prop^h^ecy came upon  me and bore testimony that if we were faithful ^the Lord would send his angels before our face and^ many would beleive on our words and would repent of  o their sins and go into the waters of baptism, and every one spoke and bore testimony they beleived in my words.  We took a list of all the gentiles within a circuit of about 20 miles and s[e]perated ourselves and went out two by two and divided up the families equally among us which was about 40 in all, and went forth trusting in the Lord, and we took with 
 4  us tracts, voice of Warning, books of Mormon and other works that teaches the word of God and we went by day and by night into their homes, and we searched them out and if they were 5 or 6 miles away from home we went and found them, and explained plainly why we had come unto them, and many beleved on our words and promised to come out to our meetings at conference time, but some did not beleive, but would say unto us: "if the contentions among the mormons was the fruits of Mormonism they did not such a gospel as we taught &c" but we showed unto them what they had seen among the saints was the weakness of man and ^that^ perfection did not dwell in the flesh, and we contended for the faith and for the Plan of salvation and which God had 
 Colorado Mission. 1950 South Pennsylvania Street, Denver, Colorado. June 30, 1897.  Pres. Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  Having changed my address you will please  forward all mail to me as above.  We have a baptism at Overland tomorrow, and I am happy to report that we have nine applications for the same, and a number of promising prospects.  We have baptized 43 person during the past six months. Elder W. C. Clive met with quite a serious bicycle accident about four weeks ago, which has di[s]abled him for about a month forom performing any missionary labor, but is now al- most well again and will go into the missionary field next week.  The reports from all the ELders are to the effect that they are holding meetings, and that they are treated kindly by the peopie.  We are making a special effort to sell our church works as we find that the people will read a book that they pay for, whereas if it is given to them they are liable to lay it aside and not read it. 
 5  restored again to the earth and while we met some opposition God was with us and we bore testomony unto them standing up in their homes in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. We invited them to  our meetings and conference and left them books to read and promised them if they would read them with good and honest hearts and a prayerful spirit that God would reveal unto them the things that was written therein was true, and thus we visited them all.  We held conference Saturday and Sunday and I felt constrained to advise the Elders to confine their remarks to the repentance, faith, and baptism and the laying on of hands and to bear testimony of ^the prophet^ Joseph Smith and the Divinity of the Book of Mormon. 
 We held a conference on June 19th and 20th in the city of Denvsr and it seemed to have a very good effect upon the people, and has been t[h]e means of gaining for us more friends We will hold a conference in Pueblo July 17th and 18th.  We could use several more ELders to very good  advantage.  Praying God to bless you, and asking an interest in your faith and prayers, I remain  Your brother in the Gospel.  John W. Taylor  Very good report. Has he got all those he named some time ago? Let us rustle up a few Elders for Colorado, as soon as we can. J. F. S. 
 6  Our conference was held in a fine Bowery buildt by the saints of Sanford.  The Lord poured out his Holy spirit upon the young Elders as they spake one bye one and the singing rendered by them seemed Devine, and the Holy spirit bore witness unto all who was honest that their testimony was true.  On monday we had the pleasure of takeing 45 down into the watters of baptism, and from 800 to 1000 persons came out to witness the sons and daughters of God receive a remission of their sins for the people rejoiced to see the wicked come into the fold of Christ  We held a Priesthood meeting in Sanford and the Lord blessed us with his spirit and a number of men who had been in transgressiong came forth at the close of the meeting and confessed their sins 
 John W. Taylor June 30 [18]97 
 7  for I was constrained to call upon the Priesthood to repent of their sins and sustain the authorities of the stake and be one with them, and put away all lieing and evil speaking against them and I read unto them sec 121 of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants and bore testimony unto them that the words of the Lord would not fail and their hearts was softened, and at the close of the meeting the spirit of God wrought upon them so mightily that they cried like children, and came forward and asked President Smith's pardon, and promised to do anything that was required of them and everything was fixed up, and all is now united again in this stake and peace and harmony prevails among the 
 8  Priesthood and Saints.  Grain crops are heavy in this valley the Potatoe crop is light, grain is ripe and all the farmers are now in the harvest field.  I leave for D Pueblo to night I would recommend the name of John C. Dalton Jr to go on a  mission and with your permission would be pleased to have him in this mission.  Very well, let it be so, and let bro Taylor & Prest. A. R. Smith set him apart. J. F. S.  I have just received word from Elder Robinson that 2 families in  Colorado Springs has applied for baptism  Praying God to bless you and lengthen out your days upon the earth and asking a Kind remembrance to Presidents Cannon and Smith and all the brethern I remain 
 9  Your brother in the Gospel John W. Taylor  The Elders are all well I have put three in the north end of this valley in Rio Grand and Costillo counties.  J. W. T.  Aug. 23d [18]97 read to Prest. W. Woodruff and he pronounced it "a good letter." I sincerely hope the reconciliation among the Saints will prove genuine and and permanent. And that those who have been baptized will stay baptized, repentant and faithful. Then indeed we should all be thankful, and give gratitude to God. I would be glad to feel confident that the work done will prove genuine. J. F. S.  over

 OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  P.O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah, March 23rd, 1896.  ELDERS JAMES E. STEELE, ROBERT L. BYBEE, JOS. S. MULLINER,  Presidency of the Bingham Stake.  Dear Brethren:  Your letter of the 13th inst., addressed to President George Q. Cannon, contains an enquiry concerning the correct language to be used in ordaining a man to the office of an Elder. You say some little difference of opinion exists among the brethren of your Stake on this point.  We do not like to write out a form of ordination for the office of an Elder. But it is a very simple ceremony, as are all the ceremonies connected with the ordinances. This is beautifully illustra- ted in the form which the Lord gives, on page 609 of the Book of Mormon, concerning the ordination of Priests and Teachers.  There are some people who seem to attach great importance to phraseology, and are very technical, and think things are not done right unless every word is spoken just as it should be. This is not right. A spirit of that kind leads to disputations as to forms; and we find considerable of that arising from time to time in theological clas- ses and among others. That which is necessary in ordaining a man is to ordain him to the office in the Aaronic Priesthood or the Melchisedek Priesthood (whichever it may be) by the authority of tyhe Holy Priesthood 
 and in the name of Jesus. This, in a few words, is all that we think necessary to be said upon the subject.  With kindest regards,  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said we all stood in need of  Faith, especially at the present time, we have ^had^ good  peace for a great many years, and he had no doubt but every one would sooner or later be tried to  the very core. We should be prepared for every  thing that may come along. We are the friends  of God, and the world is it war with us, and  he was glad of it. God has put into our hands the Gospel of Christ, the Kingdom of God,  and that makes the world mad, as for  Polygamy they did not care so much for it,  as for the dust under their feet.  If it requires the United States to shed more blood of the saints, before their cup is full, they  will shed it, there never was a more corrupt  nation dwell on the face of the earth, than  that which now exists on this covenant.  And the saints should never in their prayers 
 forget to pray for Colfax, and the Government  in the right way. We have everything to  encourage us in doing right -- to keep the word  of Wisdom, and whatever is required of us  No man ever apostatizes from this church  without transgressing the laws of God, either  secretly or openly -- the Spirit of God will  never leave any one without sufficient cause.  Prest Young is not without Revelation,  he is not without the power and Spirit of God,  he has councilled the saints for a great many years,  by the mind and will of God, and if everything  had to be done by Revelation, many of us would  now be living under great condemnation. 
 Elder W. Woodruff in his acquaintance with Joseph  Smith & Brigham Young, said he never knew either to give any council but what always  came out true, instancing the Sidney Rigdon whom Joseph wished to through [throw] off &c  We have got to follow the Lord  the Celestial law must be abided or we  never can be exhalted.  Prest. Young is our Lawgiver and stands between us and God, and if God has  any revelation to give to man, he will not give it to him ^me^, nor Billy Godbe, but  it will come through Prest. Young  he will speak through his mouthpiece God has placed him as our leader in  temporal as well as in other things we shall be dictated by revelation and council and those who abide it and will be saved. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff. Moved and was seconded That this meeting be turned into a caucus meeting, for the purpose of making nominating  our City Officers, preparatory to the forthcoming  Election. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we were approaching  a very interesting time, and as the Lord will have a tried people we shall ^have^ a severe  test to prove and try the saints something  that make us look around us, and ascertain  where we shal stand the nation on this  continent is nearly ripe in iniquity, and will certainly be destroyed, according to the revelations  given to Joseph Men that are not ground in their faith by revelation, must past away  in the trying hour every weapon that  is formed against us, will not prosper  Let the Elders read the revelations and become  acquainted with them that we may see what is coming The Lord does not  require us to make war upon our enemies until he reveals it from heaven   He could afford to lay down his temporal life, rather than forfeit his eternal salvation  If it was necessary let Prest Young and others  be hid up in these mountains but he did  not think the Lord was going to destroy the  faithful saints of God but let every faithful Man of God be willing to assume his share of  responsibility, instead of throwing everything on the 
 Elder W. Woodruff said, this being a school of ^the^ prophets, should be profitable to those who come here, the spirit of God  that each Elder possesses is the spirit of prophesy--we have  had the living oracles in our midst for 40 years on the  6th April next--And as a people we have got to  prepare a place for the coming of the Son of Man-- the United States had been warned ^lately^ by several hundred missionaries, perhaps for the last time, and their  testimonies will stand good before God, Angels and  Men--the situation of the people required  the Servants of God to interfere with temporal things, and council and instruct them in the  principle of cooperation &c, this gives offence to some, but all things are necessary from time to time -- he then urged the necessity of each one who  comes to this school, observing the rules which we  have covenanted to observe -- We want an  increase of faith, so as to meet all the opposition  and persecution we may have to encounter.  He then commended the Calmness and composure  of our leader Prest Young, under the most trying 
 shoulders of Prest Young   There was a very wicked spirit in this City, which  was connected with the same lying spirit at Washington.  When Colfax was here, he had the pleasure of preach- ing the Gospel to him and warn him against shedding innocent blood let us stand valiently and bear  our testimony, and leave the event in the hands of God  let us go before the Lord, and pray that Hypocrites and  liars may be gathered out. 
 circumstances, encouraged the school to put their  trust in God, and be united, and do our duty, And our Leaders will be inspired to lead this people in a straight path and Zion will be built up -- and the Go blessings of God will rest upon  his people, and may thHe enable each one to  do their is my prayer in the name of Jesus -- 
 Elder W. Woodruff, loved to see men valient in  a good cause, especially in the testimony of  Jesus He had known Elder Taylor as far back as Kirtland, stand up nobly in defending the  prophet Joseph The spirit made manifest  here to day, he had no doubt existed among all the Elders of Israel.  This was the great Kingdom of our God, and  our Government will not rot and come to 
 Elder W. Woodruff . said a Man must live his religion  if he expects to be benefited by it. He was satisfied that a faithfull man of God will have his reward  One fault among latter day saints was a looseness  in paying his obligations. We should improve in this  No one apostatizes from this church in a day, it  generally commences in a neglect of duty Many both in and out of the Church find fault with Prest Young, and say that he tyranizes over the  people, but he has known him fir many years, both  in public and private, and no one, whom he ever knew had so few failings as Brigham Young, but  He had been a great benefactor to the poor, whom  he had brought from their poverty in the old country  and placed them in comfortable circumstances in  these vallies. We as a people must keep  the commandments of God if we expect to be saints -  we must try to overcome our taste for Tea, Coffee, Tobacco, Whiskey &c it was a warfare, and will  be, as long as we live, but the truth that leads to  eternal life is a narrow one. 
 nought, hav being about to fill up the measure  of their iniquity we do not know what  the Lord wants to do with us, but we must take  it patiently, and whatever the Lord says through  his servant Brigham, we will do.  He had been baptized for all his friends, and  was ready to go behind the vail any time the  Lord wanted him but Zion will prosper  and be built up, every latter day Saint should  live to build it as far as they have strength  and ability. He then prophesied the speedy  destruction of this Nation, and the establishment  if the Kingdom of God  
 our future condition and exaltation, certainly  depends on the course we pursue here.  We are the best people on the earth, and he had  no doubt but we were trying to improve our  lives.  He did not believe, the wicked will ever  disturb us from our homes   if we will only  do right, and prize our priveleges.  He knew this was the Gospel, and these are the  people of God, and we have the ordinances but if Zion needs cleansing, God will cleanse her.  He prayed that God would prepare us for whatever  is coming   to be true and faithful & c 
 On Saturday May 14th 1870 Theological Class met at the Tabernacle at One o clock pm  Present Prest Geo. A. Smith presiding After singing Prayer by Elder S. W. Richards Singing Elder A P. Rockwood recommended a systematic  organized effort being made to destroy the Grasshoppers unless it is done, he was satisfied there will be but  little raised this season.  Elder W. W. Woodruff  said the best plan he had found  to destroy them was to get a large sheet, and a  man at each corner to drag it through the  grain, and when caught & bury them it  certainly was their duty to make an organized  effort, and if after that is done, and the  Crops are destroyed, we shall have the satisfaction  of having done our duty. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff reported that a considerable  effort had been made during the week by Bro Turnbow and those who had turned out to assist  him, in the destruction of the Grasshoppers, and  hoped that a union of Gra exertion will be  continue to be made that our wheat may be  spared 
 Elder W. Woodruff had a pleasant journey up north  the leading Council given, was ^for^ the Saints to lay  up their grain had they heeded it before, the  Grasshoppers would not have visited us  Woollen and other Factorys were also recommended  for the saints to build  Zion is increasing We shall soon have a  Mighty host in these vallies Parents should  teach their children the Gospel of Christ  He hoped the Saints would magnify their callings  and build up the Kingdom of God  He would like to have them build one Temple in these vallies hundreds had got to be built.  If we did our duty, we shall never be driven  away from these vallies  When the time comes, for the Saints to go back to  build up Zion in Jackson County that these vallies  will not be vacated entirely, neither will all  return to that Country. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff refered to the many priveleges that latter day Saints enjoy, was glad many were waking up to the subject of Baptism for the dead He had been baptized and sealed to all his progenitors that he could find out He then made comparisons between the beautify and glory of our religion, and the nonsense of what the world called  religion   When we pray, we pray to a being who has a Head, a Heart, and a perfect organization  people apostatize, because they dont keep the commandments of God, they dont study the scriptures,  what is not yet revealed  will be, a little at a while until we shall receive all ^that^ is essential for our perfection &c 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said we are all here by Faith Utah would never have been inhabited without faith  Joseph Smith brought forth the book of Mormon through faith He himself, had been sustained And done what he had done since he embraced the Gospel, by Faith He was one who went up in Missouri to fight the state, to redeem Zion by Faith 
 All our works had been performed by faith  He had faith that our enemies would be stirred up to fight against us but Salvation, such that is promised unto us should stimulate us to exercise faith and our works should correspond to do what God required of us Some had not faith enough to retain their standing in the church, they had gradually given way to temptation and given way to overt acts until the Spirit of the Lord was entirely withdrawn from them.  God was going to build up Zion in spite of Earth or Hell A man who has received the Holy Ghost had the Apostleship &c and then fall away, had far better have had a Millstone co put around his neck and cast into the sea  He did not want to live one hour only while he continued in the faith  Let our wants be known before the Lord, and pray for our friends and enemies also.  We will ^have^ plenty of new principles as fast as we can appreciate and live up to them 
 Elder W. Woodruff commented severely  on the wilful practise of Herd boys destroying  fences, and damaging the late crops, And shewed the necessity of enter^ing^ into all our  operations, the principle of cooperation.^The importation of Bees and Fish^ 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said, he alone was responsible  for what was said about Bp Gardners ward party,  he was not present himself, but from reports that  reached him, he had stated last saturday what  he did, was pleased with Bp Gardners statement,  realized the difficulties that B'ps labour under,  especially in the management of parties, where  licquor happens to get in, if only by a few  He hoped Bp Gardner would be blest in controuling  his ward he entertained a high regard for him 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we had been in school a  good while, and ^he^ believed we were approaching a very great and important crisis as a people  he also believed, we were improving and ad- vancing. The Angel told Joseph what would become of cerain nations, quoted many passages  of ancient scriptures, and taught him their appli cation, by this means he was t instructed and  taught from a pure and correct fountain. the spirit of revelation grew up in him until  he became throughly acquainted with it. The same spirit dwelt in Bro Brigham  and ^had^ been growing in him for many years we want to learn God and the spirit of God as well as the sciences, for there are many  great philosophers well versed in the sciences  are not only ignorant of God, but are infidel in their principles. Let any one read the Pro- phecies in Isaih, Book of Mormon, Doctrine &  Covenants with a prayerful spirit, and we can  almost write the future of many nations.  He spoke of the diversity of gifts and qualifica tions, some quick to discern one thing, and some  another. There was a necessity for each one  to learn the voice of the Spirit, mentioning two  cases ^of^ self preservation in is own experience  by listening to and obeying the whisperings  of the spirit. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said in behalf of the parent associ ation, for the introduction of Improved Stock, Bees,  Swine, Sheep &c &c, while they were calling ^upon^ other  counties to cooperativee with them in establishing  branch associations it was very necessary  for us in Salt Lake County to start in a  cooperative effort to herd our stock so as  to have the ranch cleared of all that is now  running loose have a regular system  on an upright principle that every one  may have their rights there as been a great  amount of dishonesty practised by individuals  who have undertaken to take stock & sheep on  shares, and we want to do away with this. 
 (3) Jan 14, 18701 W. Woodruff. continued adverted to the hand  of God in our present peace and quiet we enjoy  in this City, notwithstanding the hue and cry of our  bitter enemies, in the set time of the almighty  Not only this Nation, but other Nations that  lift their hands against this work  will be broken to pieces and come to  nought. Prayed that we might all  become more acquainted with the spirit  of God, understand his purposes, and  be prepared for the great things that  are coming to pass. 
 Elder W. Woodruff felt it was a time when we ought  to watch as well as pray we are having a  great influx of strangers in our midst and among  them, many speculators, who are trying to get our  land and Houses by purchase or otherwise  He strongly recommended the brethren who have  property to rent, to call on Prest. Wells for council and always have the writings drawn up by Judge  Smith or Hosea Stout, and not sign any documents  drawn up by strangers for fear we should  have advantage taken of us No amount of  means could tempt him to sell his inheritance and he hoped the brethren would hold their homes  as being most sacred  The Mines were now being opened and  developed, for the special benefit of the  saints, and by and bye if we do right, our  eyes will be opened to see ^that^ the hand of the  Lord is over us for good Zion will soon arise and arise shine, and increase, our enemies  are not going to destroy us, nor take away our  rights. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said these important  subjects, require our wisdom, patience and  perseverance He spoke of Father Russell  ship builder, who before embracing the Gospel had his Life & Ships Insured, but after that,  drew his interest out, and paid his Insurance  money into the church, and trusted in God to  take care of his life and property.  He also explained some particulars about  starting the Co operative Herd  Spoke of the opposition we have had to  contend with from the Government Officials  who have tried to bring us into bondage & trouble  but have signally failed, God has heard  the prayers of the faithful and delivered us  out of the hands of the wicked he feels  that God will continue to break every weapon  that is formed against us our enemies are  very short lived, God has cut them off  and will do so, & build up Zion.  let us therefore combine and cooperate together  and have integrity and shew that are in every  worthy of the confidence of both God and man 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we ought to rejoice in the  privelege of living in a day when we can assist in  building a Temple to the name of the most high no one since the days of Solomon has had such a  privelege many efforts have been made to destroy  us in this generation, but the hand of God has been  outstretched towards us and delivered us from the  hands of our enemies 
 We are abundantly able to do what is required of  us if we are only willing.  He felt anxious to respond to the call made  last Saturday for funds to emigrate the poor but having no ready means on hand was the only  cause he did not.  He would give 1,000 lbs Flour to help feed  the hands that work on the Temple  It was quite a privelege to help build up the Kingdom  of God We cannot take behind the vail  any of our property with us, but we can take with  us, those blessings that have been put on our  heads by the servants of God, if we will only live  for them. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, spoke on the same subject ^of sustaining home manufactory;^ Shall we sustain our own machinery and  manufactories, or shall we neglect it we ought to study the interests of Zion, if  we dont study its interests, we had better g leave  and go to California we had better  Cooperate in everything that will build  up Zion we  have the power to build  a Temple and occupy it a privelege  which the ancient apostles never had  We are building a Zion here, though Earth  & Hell are opposing us whatever  council is given us, let us carry it out. 
 Elder W. Woodruff warned the school against telling out  of this house what is spoken here, but keep sacred the covenants we have made 
 Elder W. Woodruff, said the secret of the present  antagonism about Polygamy, was simply, because  it was a command of God, and Lucifer was opposed  to it. He did not believe in abandoning one principle  of the Gospel to please this Nation or any other.  We can afford to risk the issue and consequences  of the present persecution the controversary  is between God and the Nation.  Let us remember to keep the commandments of God, to attend to our prayers and duties  and God will deliver us We shall certainly  come off much better, by cleaving to our religion  than by bartering any portion of it away for the sake  of a state government Let us unite our prayers together. 
 Elder W. Woodruff strongly recommended the  Elders of Israel to keep a Journal of the dealings  of God with them the Prophet Joseph used  to urge this upon the Elders k Bro Woodruff said  heco Kept a record of every sermon that he heard Joseph  preach He wished that a more correct account  had been Kept of the early doings of the early Elders  of the church, and the dealings of God with his  people he has never neglected one day without  writing something in his diary  In regard to the spirit of Prophecy, we are apt to look  two high, and except too much in the wrong direction  the still small voice of the spirit was what we should  seek after and cultivate the church in its infancy  When a man was called to go on a mission, the Lord 
 had to be enquired of, and obtain from Him a revelation but now Prest. Young living in the light of revelation hundreds are called to go on a mission and have  to start in a few hours the Church has grown, and we are continually led by the spirit of revelation  We have much to be grateful for, the Kingdom  is onward and upward He then related several  forewarnings of danger ^by the spirit of God^ which he always listened  to and acted upon, and himself, family & friends  saved from sudden destruction 
 Elder W. Woodruff hoped to live long enough  to see pleasant Ephraim enjoy all the blessings, that were long since, enjoyed by their forefathers   he then spoke of the Elders of Israel who held the  destinies of the Nations in their hands, and the  necessity of them living worthy of their high and  holy calling. He then related a dream  that he had while on a Mission to in England   pertaining to the Lamanites. he saw a beautiful  Temple rerected on the mountains of Israel, he  went in, and while there, a large number of Laman- ites came in and seated themselves in a place by themselves, by and bye, they began to work, and they seemed to accomplish more in two hours  than others could do in a day, but a strict  account was kept of ^all^ the labour that was performed  by every one in that house. and they appeared  to have been inspired by some prophet to enter  that Temple, and enter upon those blessings promised  by their forefathers. 
 the acts of the wicked will fall upon their own head,  and the righteous will be delivered it is our  privelege to ask the Lord for a State Government,  and if its his will, he will grant it, by raising up  friends to urge our petition through both Houses of  Congress do not forget our prayers, nor fail in any  of our duties and God will establish Zion in these  Mountains. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke with gratitude to God, for the prospect  of a bountiful Harvest. He wa had also commenced to  favour Zion, to build it up, gather the poor, would bless  the leaders of Iassrael with the light of revelation and,  &c 
 We are a branch of Ephraim, and received the  Gospel first. and should treat the poor  degraded Indian with Kindness, for they fell through unbelief, we should also be anxious to  build this Temple here, and that in St George. He then spoke of the persecution that was pressing  upon us by the heads of this nation, by unlawfully  keeping in bondage, our Brethren. as Latter  day Saints, we should seek the blessing of God  of upon the saints, and his displeasure upon his  enemies. The Leaders of this people have stood  the test, and been proved for many years hence,  we should hold up their hands, and exercise  faith for them, these honours and labours that  God has put upon our brethren, should stimulate  us follow in their footsteps. a faithful humble follower of Jesus Christ, is in a far more  exalted position, than can be confer'd upon men  by the world. Let us be faithful to God and  each other, and endure to the end, that we may  be saved for Jesus sake. Amen.

 Salt Lake City  Great Bason North America  Oct 7th 1848  Dear Br & Sister Woodruff with pleasure I set me down this morning in great hast to address you a few lines from which Leaves us all in good health Except myself I have had a short addttacts of the mountion fevar cussed by exposier on my Journey to sweet water & back where I met the companies the 26 day of Sept ^August^ I was also much Exposed to cold in the Salt Lake Since my returne.  Mrs Smoots gener^a^l health is much the same it was in winter quarters  Father Woodruffs health is some better at this time than it has been since he has been in the valy Yet he feels dizcuraged in meny things & often wishes himself back to the East where he could have some comforts the remander of his days  BJames Bevin who you Left in charge of your Buness has actterd Eevery thing but the part of a Gentleman with the old man.  The wolves Eat the mans corn Last winter by neglect of hurding her regular which I was unable to have attended to myself haveing a house to build & other buness that  I was a blessed to attend to.  Your oter Bevin had two good Cows in his charge that he took out on the farme & milked & Left the father Woodruff perfectly destitute of milk & Butter only as Iwe furnished him 
 I repeatedly requestied him to Let the old man have a  a cow but he refused as often. I then complaned of him before the council & their compelle ^him^ to let the old man have a cow. With my assistence Father Woodruff Saved Last fall 3 acres of wheat & 2 1/2 of rye, but it all didnot Yeald him 12 bushels of grain which  has bredid them up to this time & some 2 or 3 bushels  Left for Seed a po[r]tion of which Bevin clames he also ^clames^ one half or 2 thirds of the corn crop for which he has commenced a Suit, if he obtaines it it will Leave the old man vary Scant of breadstuff. Bevin says he has nothing more to do with you only to retain posses ion of one of those roomes you built untill he gits his pay for the building of them. That deprives Br Benbow of going into Eather of them. Consequen tely he refuses to take charge of your goods & they Lye Just as they did the Last year Exposed to the murcy of whom soever Bevin is disposed to quarter their in  he however tells brother Benbow that he may come ^the room^ in with him in according to your request in the Letter you wrote to him.

 Great Salt Lake City Oct. 16, 1849  Elder Wilford Woodruff  Beloved Brother  We received lengthy communications, scraps and Papers from you, by the last mail, which we have scarce had time to read, in full; business has pressed so heavily upon us, but we understand your situation, and will make all the communication at this time, that the nature of the case will admit.  Our mail is closed, and about ready to start. Our General Epistle is in Type, by which you will learn General news, and we shall send this, and many more communications by Express, to overtake the mail in the mountains. Your friends are well, and the People generally, and we would all be glad to see you here with your family.  Gather up all the Saints in the East, this Winter, and make ready, and in the Spring come with them, and you will see great improvements have taken place since you left home. Tell the brethren of Capital to bring means to establish factories.  Say to the brothers Livingston, at Peterboro, that next year there will be wool enough raised in the Valley, to supply a considerable factory, that the cloth is needed here, that here is the place for building Zion, that here is a better place to manufacture and make money than any other place: and persuade one or all, and all such to remove with delay to this place. Next Season we design a settlement over the rim of the Basin on the South, where cotton, rice and sugar cane will flourish, and from whence we can get our supplies: but even at present, it would be far better to transport the raw cotton from the States and have it manufactured here, than to bring the cloth, for there are good water privileges in abundance, and experienced workmen on hand. therefore start out a company both for cotton and woollen manufacturing, this Winter ready for spring's emigration with machinery, &c, and every facility will be granted them in this place, which possible can be. 
 Also we want some Iron founders. There is coal and Iron not far distant in good locations, and moulders in the Valley, therefore do not fail to bring us a founder, for castings of all descriptions are much needed, and there is no location in the States so good as this for the business.  There is no class of mechanics or manufactures but can do  well here, for we are in the centre of Creation, and in need of many things except Gold, but should we tell you all we have seen and handled you could scarce believe.  In the short space of about one month we have received by voluntary donation over 5,500 dollars for a perpetual emigrating fund, and sent Bishop Hunter, to the States  to gather up the Poor. Further particulars you will glean from our Epistle, and our letters to brother Hyde, a copy of which you will doubtless see. You are an agent to solicit and receive donations for said fund: any means you can gather and forward to Bishop Hunter at Kanesville early in the Spring will be immediately applied, to its destined object.  Find brother Benjamin S. Wilber of New York and bring  him on with all his goods. We also want brother Jesse C. Little to settle up his affairs and come to this place. This is the place for business, for increasing and doing good.  Come with the Saints, Master Workmen, machinery, with your Gold, (not Silver 'tis too heavy) and all precious things, and when you arrive, we shall have so much to tell you what we cannot write, you will be ready to declare "a half has not been told me," Yes Bro Woodruff stretch out your arms like a man of God, and gather up and bring a host to Zion.  With our best wishes and blessings on yourself and family and all the faithful. We remain your brethren in Christ.  Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Willard Richards 
 P.S. Agreeably to your last letter, brother Richards expects you have accomplished your mission with brother Russel, and that the transfer has been completed long before this.  WR

 New York October 13, 1853  Dear Brother,  I arrived here on the 8th instant and on the same day remitted your drafts to Messrs Sanborn & Carter who have since acknowledged the receipt of them.  I suppose some of my goods have been consederably damaged by getting wet.  If the clock got wet, and has not been disposed of, I should think it would be well to employ Dimock Huntington, or some one else to rub it up a little, and oil it to prevent it from rusting.  In haste I am Yours very truly  John M Bernhisel  Mr. W. Woodruff

 Washington City Dec. 14, 1849  Dear Brother,  I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letters ^dated^ at Bordentown & New York, as well as three letters from your friend Mr Carter to member of Congress. The petition for a territorial government to which the signa- tures are affixed will not be presented to Congress, but the memorial accompanying the Constitution which asks for our admission as a state, or for such other form of government as Congress may grant us I had a long and pleasant interview with jude Douglass the other evening, and his advice was to apply for admission as a state or for a territorial government, and leave the alternative with Congress which to give us, he said this would show our readiness to defray the expenses of a state government, and our willingness to accept a territorial government, that this course would be manly and honorable From the intercourse I have had with members of Congress, I am pretty well satisfied that we shall not get anything more than a territorial government, in this event I shall do all I can to have President Young appointed governor, and such other officers as will be acceptable to the people Ten days have now been spent by the House in unavail- ing attempts to elect a Speaker The excitement and confusion in the House yesterday & the day before were at times very great.

 New York Octobr 18 1849  Dear Brother,  On my arrival here I found a letter from the Presidentcy of the Church, informing me that a constitution had been formed, and a state government organized in the valley, and instruct- ing me to apply to Congress at its approaching session for the admission of Deseret into the Union on the same footing as the original states  I am also desired not to deliver my letter to Col Kane, therefore I shall consider myself under particular obligations to you if you will have the goodness to favor me with a letter of introduction to Col Kane, saying that any assitance he may render me in my the proposed application to Congress will gratefully acknowledged &c  Be pleased to direct to the City of New York, if I should not be here your letter will be forward to me My respects to sister Woodruff   Yours Truly J.

The report this morning is that Mead will challenge Duer to mortal combat, and in the event of his declining, which Madam Vernons says he will, then he (Mead) will attack him in the street or wherever he may meet him This will be an exciting and stormy session, and if there be not some duels fought I shall be disappointed The Lord has indeed and in truth come out of his hiding place to vex this nation  I avail myself of the accosion to tender to sister Woodruff my kind regards, and to renew to you ^assurances of^ my high respect and esteem   John M.

 Washington Dec. 4th 1849  Dear Sir,  On Saturday morning I had the pleasure of receiving you note of the 30th Ult. and an introductory one to Mr Plitt which I delivered the same day Mr Plitt has rendered me very essential service, and I fell deeply indebted to him for his courtesy and kindness This morning I have received your favor of Monday enclosing a letter for Mr which I shall take an early opportunity to deliver Mr Babbitt arrived here on Saturday evening, and immediately called on me, when I stated to him the course which you had indicated for us to pursue, but he remarked that he had already committed himself, and therefore could not take neutral ground in politics Our prospects here are quite as encouraging as I had anticipated, still we shall probably meet with pretty strong opposition on account of the Sparsity of our population, though we may fail in being admitted as a state, yet I entertain strong hopes that they will grant us a Territorial Government The prospect as present is that the House will not be organized for a day two yet Be pleased to accept my grateful for the favors which you have conferred, and for the deep interest you take in our application for admission Truly & Respectfully Yours  Col Kane John M.

I learned that my wife had taken the Liberty to wear it to a party in the ward, & on her returning home the wind blew her neck Ribin off, & the pin was lost in the Snow; she made diligent Search for it, but as yet to no purpose This to us is extremely unpleasant, but it be- ing the facts; I considered it my duty to inf- orm you, unpleasant as it may be to us both, & can only say that I shall continue my diligence in trying to find it, & in case I do not succeed make it good to you by getting you another one equally as good at as early a period as I can: & ask your pat- ience & forgiveness, in the mean time as much as possible.  Since I came home I have been employed, to teach a school in this Ward for the term of Six months 46 scholars has been subscribed, at $35 50/100 per quarter  School commences next Monday I am happy also in saying to you, that the Brethren is do- ing a good business on the City wall 
 if we are prospered I think that by another Dec we shall have some thing in the way of Fortification, & Public buildings, that will be at least respect- able & comfortable this appears to be now the determination of the Brothern in this place.

 [sideways text] Elder Orson Spencer Jany. 18 1848 [end of sideways text]  Liverpool Jan. 18, 1848  Dear Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Having learnt by a Letter received yesterday from Pres. Brigham Young dated Nov. 25th that you with the greater part of your Quorum had returned to Winter Quarters, I resolved to Seize, (not a favorable moment for writing to you,) but rather a forced capture of some fleeting moments to fulfill my promise & delight in the matter. It cheers my heart to learn that you have become sound enough to make a visit of two thousand miles over the mountains in one season in company with so many of your beloved Quorum. All in health & increased strength I say to glory to God for this glorious & successful but arduous expedition of the Latter Day Liberators! This expedition will constitute a new epoch in the annals of the everlasting kingdom, that will be conspicuous for worlds to come for the energy enterprize & indefatigable endurance of the performance The results of this expedition are endlessly by praiseworthy and glorious. I shall now venture to tell the British Saints and the Nations of Europe that Zion is established That their eye may look upon her that is to be the joy of the whole earth & and an eternal excellency." Beautiful for Situation is that place. The mountains are round about the fat valley of the great basin 
 as a munition of Rocks. The splendid intelligence of  the millennial Era is requisite in order to appreciate the worth of the labors of the first founded of the kingdom of Latter day glory. I shall boldly declare that a resting place for the laboring & heavy laden of all Nations is now prepared. I can now answer the moanful cry of the emigrant that has often been reiterated in my ears in this land; "When may we emigrate? I have long been out of business and expending my means, when can I emigrate? Now I have the happiness through your toils and memorable discovery & liberal permission to announce the welcome day. I do not regret having come to England on this important mission, neither shall I regret an invitation to return when it comes from your dear & honored Quorum. The past year has been one of great prosperity as to the enlargement of the Church in this Island & the increase of faith and diligence & zeal in the work of the Lord. Many thousands have been added to the Church & peace & union have pervaded all parts of the Kingdom of Christ  on this Island. In Wales there has been added to the Church about one hundred & fifty a month for five or six months past. In nearly all places the work moves forward with the most delightful impulse. All feel strong & ardent for the increase of the Saved. What will be the effect of Emigration upon the future impulse & progress of the work is 
 yet problematical. American Elders will become  scarce after three more leave the Island. A few recruits would not come amiss. Agreeable to my instructions from counselcil I shall open the channels of emigration with all possible diligence. The Emigrants will almost unavoidably stop at different places. Some are anxious to go, if they can reach no further than St Louis or even New Orleans & I am glad that the Council saw fit to appoint an agent to look after them at these places. I need not inform you that it will be very necessary. I have increased the number of our Paper during the year about 5 or six hundred. The present numbers now issued at the commencement of the Two first no's of the tenth volume are about 32,000 I have printed nearly 200,000 small Tracts or "Invitations" and more than 150,000 pages of larger Tracts which are spread abroad among the people aiming thereby to warn & invite all the inhabitanits of this Island as far as practicable. The Saints are almost enthusiastic in preaching & warning the people in every possible way. The new Edition of the Hymn Book is nearly all sold. A small new Edition of the Book of Mormon is also just printed. I have also just printed a Small volume mostly of Letters in continuation of a reply to Rev. Wm Crowil Boston Mass. U. S. A. which received a ready demand I have purchased a Phonatic Font of 329 pounds wright for the Council according to request, and shall 
 Send ^it^ by Bro Wheelock Soon; having no chance to Send it Sooner safely. I shall also purchase a good microscope to send at the same time. I have addressed three Letters to Pres. Young since I have been here, one of them was Superscribed to Pres. Young or Pres. Hyde. I have in the absence of Pres. Young (over the mountain) written to Eld. Orson Hyde on the business of the Church, supposing him to be the proper authority to counsel me.  I am fully ready to return home or to remain or go elsewhere hopeing thereby to secure the confidence of the "Twelve" whom I ever desire to obey in the Lord as it is meet. The friendly hint given me by Pres. Young when he appointed me to this mission and lately repeated & formerly seconded by Bro Pratt, viz not to walk in the steps of my defaulting predecessors in office almost inclined me to look over my geography to see in what part of the world it is that they poke one horse because another horse is unruly. My heart is  sometimes melted like wax to think of my desolate and now sick little children & I could return to them with joy if so counselled. But I am blessed so far with  the faith & support of all Israel & hope ever to merit the same by well doing. Crime & distress are awful in this land and the evils increase rather than disminish. The power of the endowment is mightily visible in Europe if not in America. My playful allusion to the hint to Pres. Young is, done with the utmost kindness & respect for his motives & the wisdom of the hint. Remember me in the praying circle for I never felt my need of wisdom more. Give my love to your wife & Pres Young & I want to say more but business hurries & my sheet is full.  Orson Spencer

 [sideways text] Mrs Phebe W. Woodruff Dec 23 [end of sideways text]  Great Salt Lake Citty Dec 23 [18]55  Dear Willford  I have thought that I would not write you at all but as you kindly asked me to write ^I have changed my mind.^ The weather here since the friday after you left has been dull and clowdy with frequent small snows which has soon melted away untill last friday night about midnight the wind blew a gale I think the hardest that I ever heard it it made the house shake I did not know but it would fall but in the morn all was safe and we had more snow than we have had in all  this winter the day following was cold which was the only cold day that we have had this winter. The most of the leaves remain on the appletrees yet. My health is not veyvery good this win- ter I fearl much of the effects of my summers work. The chil- dren all go to school but Bula, Willford has had very bad eyes for 8 or 10 days so that he cannot read or study. Fathers health is uncommonly good this winter but I never knew him as fractious as he is and has been lately. Last thursday sister's Pratt, Hyde, Taylor Kimball Benson Hooper & Smith made me a visit, (sister Young being quite sick she could not come,) the most of them brought their letters and read them and we had a very pleasent time. Sister Smith's letter was read first which gave the infor- mation of Br. Pratt's addition to himself. I think there was some jokes passed and prophecyes, delivered upon the occasion, however it was 
 nothing unexpected to her as she said they had decided upon it before he went away that is if he saw any one that would answer the purpose that he wished, he then wrote her that he had found one she said that he had been trying a number of months ^to find someone.^  I soon sent to the office when I had time and received your package and distributed them according to the directions I am glad to have you write to them ^the children^ as they have often told me that you cared nothing about them but to scold them, they were much pleased with their letters I thought them very good and they all want to write you Moroni not excepted he was much pleased and wants the children to write you for him but Bula thinks she can write write and dictate herself, so she has written some. Moroni does about as well as can be expected but he requires a tight reign kept. I thought I would not say any thing about my family cares to you to distrub your felicity but you asked me to tell you how the children Emma & Sarah got along. I think the children & Emma get along very well in school Willford has not been able to study much for sometime on account of his eyes I have got him a new pair of boots and paid $3.50 cts for them. E s^t^ays with me most of the time but the children do much better without her than with her as she waits for them & they for her so the work is principally left for me also she stirs them up to make a noise and theirs is much jargon between her and Susan which frets father much she inclines to stay here all the time she makes me much more trouble than she 
 G. S. L. Citty Dec 28 [18]55  My Dear Willford  With pleasure I acknowlege the reception of your general epistle from the hand of br Pugh which was well written and a rich treasure well distributed to the family and they duly appreciated it Your letters have quite an effect upon the children and family. I am very glad to hear from you often  I forgot to tell you that we get but one number of the news I thought perhaps you had one number sent to you. We are all well. The measles are about and I am afraid that Bula will get them.  We have sent a large package of letters to you by Br Haywood with which I think you will be amused and Phebe has just received one by mail in answer to one she wrote on the windowseat in the dusk  I knew nothing she wrote, she says she will do better next time. The weather for 3 days past has been very cold but today is mild. Br Haywood expected to have gone 2 day before this but he expects to start in the morn. I have just writen this to say that we have received I think all your letters  So good by my love good by  Phebe W. Woodruff  I think if you had as much confusion about you as I think you have it would be perplexing to you 
 does me good but she thinks she thinks she does well. If the children were alone I could say to them you must and you must not but with her I must be very careful to not give  offence she was quite offended to think that you told Sarah that her education and principles were establish she said she should tell you that it was a fine thing that one of the family was established baulderdash has showed itself a number of times there by her but I have as yet kept my foot on it. Sarah has had a cold but has got over it and is as cross as is possible she has got a web in the loom of about 20 yds. she has been 2 weeks about it and I think if she keeps on she will get it out by spring. Miss Bula is so turbulent themat I am obliged to take a stick to her sometimes, taking all things here together I have all that I can get along with I think S. & E. will write you. I am thinking of takeing the children to the ward party ^on christmas^ to please them but myself would much rather stay at home I suppose you will have fine times with you on Christmas & New years well I hope you will enjoy yourself while you can. I feel that the cares and troubles of this life are many but time rolls rapidly and I am glad of it. Susan has teased a long time to let her ask you one question at last I gave her permission so she has dictated all herself. 25th Br. Haywood has kindly sent me word this morn that he will take letters or any small package to you I dont think of any thing save these letters and Phelps bill that you will need before you come home.

 Wenll Christmas is passed and the weather was very cold. I had Emma Sarah David and James Jackson to dine with me James spent the day here. I wish you could have been here unless you was better provided for, but any way we would like to see you home. I hope you will not be sick while away as you spoke of not haveing an appetite. Last rvr the children E. and myself went to the ward party and had a very pleasant time wish you could have been there, very many went to the Hall. I find myself very comfortably situ provided for this winter I think I should enjoy it much better if the one who provided it could partake with us but I shall try to save something against you come with your new bride, for from a dream that I had on the night of the 20th about you you had or was about to get one then you spoke of the &c. The man that spoke to you about threshing the wheat called to do it but I told him he must wait untill you come home. My children are as kind and good to me as children could possibly be with the exception of Susans & Bula's freakes they have all taken turns with me in family prayr ever since you left Emma wanted to be excused but I told her she could not if she staid with me. The children have all dictated their own letter as you will perceive I have not read one of them yet. I have much work to do yet but hope you will leave your hurry at Fillmore  We ask the blessings of God to rest upon you morn. & eve.  I remain yours truly Phebe W.

 Brother W. Woo^d^ruff.  Sir, your Letter of the 9th of March, dire- cted to Bishop Partridge, Presidents Joseph Smith Jr, Sidney Rigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the Saints in Zion, came safely to them, some day's since. aAnd on account of the press of business now on their hands, ^and the request of J Smith Jr,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it. You say, that you have heard of the deplorable state of things in Kirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, that you viewed those things in their true light. Great has been the afflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our beloved Brotheren Joseph Smith Jr, and S. Rigdon.  In the past summer; I Journeyed from this place in company with Wm Smith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose of meeting in conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival, we soon learned the difeculties that then existed than: these however wase all appearantly settled, preveious by to my leaving Kirtland: And ^W^ Parish, who has since become  so [3 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the book^ ^of Mormon, reveiled religion, [illegible],^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Joseph and the Church. oOthers also did the same: But this settlement was not of long duration. Soon after this, President Hyram Smith and I, left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: and President Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ Wm Smith, soon followed us to Far West: and during their absence, it seemes that ^Wr^ Parish, J. F Bointon, Luke Johnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, [illegible] ^united^ togeather in for the [2 illegible words] ^repecting the procedings^ of the Church. President Smith and his company returned on or about the 10th of December; soon after which this [2 illegible words] ^decenting^ band, openly, and publickly, renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed, themselves to be the old standard, called themslves the Church of Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught Br Joseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks 
 How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned from Rigteousness to wickedness? They did not understand, that by taking upon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of the Church of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church, was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again, it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, which saith; ^says^ "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, and the greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given to the people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saints here alluded to, were certainly Latterday Saints; was much, as the above prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yet future, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.  We have of late learned, that pParish, and the most [rest] of this [2 illegible words], ^combination^ have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and becme deists. I will now Leave Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move- ment of things here, as they are and have been.  You, undoubtedly, will remember the visit, which I, in company with Elder Groves, made to the Churches in Kentucky and Tennessee, in the summer of 1836. You also may reecollect, the nature and result, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poor bleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of the Children of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundred and fifty dollars, which we delivered unto Wm Phelps & John Whitmer, on our arrival to this place. But these men, instead of laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleeding Zion, purchased Land for their own emolument. They g^e^nerally did their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^either^ the bishop or High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author- ities of Zion: not only because they purchased land With Church funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement, but because they selected the place of the City Far West and appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to be built on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed and ordained a committee to build the same, without asking or seeking council at the hand of either Bishop, High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under- stood that these authorities wer ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun- ciling on all important matters pertaining to the saints of God.  These two presidents also managed to get the town plott into their own hands, that they that they might reap the avails ariseing from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, with many other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3rd day of April 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishop and his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W. Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th inst. to which time they adjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the

We were 20 days out of sight of land. We had 107 souls on board composed of Anercans [Americans], English, Scotch, Irish, Weltch, Dutch, &c. We took Stearage pasage fare $15. dollars, We were quite crowded but the weather was quite comfortable I was quite pleased to once more walk on land esspecially to tread the Soil of Old Englad I have been quite pleased with Liverpool what little I have seen of it excepting the Smoke which is quite Dense We have just

 Jan" 29th 1840. At Alfred Cordon s, Club buildings, Navigation road, Burslem, Staffordshire, England.  My Dear Phebe  While seated in a foreign land I once more take up my pen to fill a sheet for your perusal May grace, mercy, faith, peace, health, strength, & patience & resignation, rest upon you from GOD our Father & our LORD JESUS CHRIST. I have chosen a large sheet because I have much I wish to say unto you. I sent you a letter when I first arived in Liverpool but had not time to write but few words but merly designed you to know of my arival But knowing that you feel interested in my mission. I will coppy from my journal in this letter an account of my voyage & travels since I left New York to the present time, & then make such other remarks as I may have room. Dec 18th, 1839 in New York. I laboured hard all day to prepare for sailing. Three of us went on board (with our Baggage) of the Oxford a regular packet ship of the New York & Liverpool line. viz Elders Taylor, Turley & myself, we slept on board. 19th The Oxford left the dock & moved out into the stream. 20th At 12 oclock she spread her canvass & set sail, was assisted a few miles by a steam Boat. She had on board 15 cabin & 64 steerage passengers & Capt John Rathbone, 1st Mate Yates, 2nd mate Jones, one carpenter & 26 sailors, making 109 souls in all. Cabin fare $1.40 dollars steerage $15. Fair wind & sail well. 21st stift breeze & fair wind most all on board sea sick. 22nd Most are still sick Taylor, Turley, & myself some sick, a high wind through the day & a high gale at night, Boat rocked & pitched Badly. 23rd Sea vary rough & winds high, some still sick 24th Sea mountains high & as rough as the Hills & valies of Kirtland. when we were in the trough of the sea, the waters would appear to be an hundred feet above us in the air, the waters broke over the ship, & I got vary wet, & as their was no fire to go to except to cook by, I sat on deck in the wind untill late in the evening to get dry, & though it was winter it was not vary cold. 25th A calm in the mo rning, the ship rocked bad upon the dead swells, wind soon rose & we sailed well 26th A rough sea & strong Breeze. 27th fair winds, but some short squals. got over sea sickness, have a sharp appetite 28th Rough sea saw a large school of Black fish & porposes. 29th pleasant morning & high breeze though the day. 30th A rough sea severe gale at night. it was with diffi- culty we could keep our births, while at the same time, Boxes, Barrels, & trunks were tumbling about the cabins. This with the noise of the Officers, & sailors reefing & taking in sail, together with the sound of the roaring winds & rushing waves made much confusion. 31st Sea rough, sails under class reef, cloudy weather. This is the Last Day of 1839. Their is not much to interest the mind while taking a voyage at sea. (excepting the roo^ll^ing [P]illows which are magestic) for one is frecquently for many days without the sight of land or ever seeing a sail at sea, & must be crouded thick together in a cabin or stay upon dek in the spray, wind, or storm &c. JAN. 1st 1840. So time rolls along rough sea, blustering, cloudy, & high winds 2nd The sun rose clear, it being the first time we have seen it for 5 days we have a calm, a sail is in sight, the first one we have seen since we left New York it is stern of us. 3rd Fair & good breeze sail 12 miles an hour. We spoke a British Brigg from Halifax 20 days at sea bound for Liverpool in Long. 34.40. We past her with great speed. 4th Fair weather & wind, stiff Breeze & fast sailing. They had a time of butchering hogs & sheep on board. 5th rough sea, high winds, & rain. We saw a large school of porposes. A calm & pleasant evening which we spent on deck viewing the stars & Ocean. 6th A calm we have 12 sails spread. 7th A dead calm to day in Lon. 17.40 The passengers shot a number of fowls which fell dead into the water. We spoke a Scottish Bark from Leith Scotland bound for Granada a west Indies Island 7 days at sea. We saw a large school of Black fish some of them were 20 feet in length. 8th a good wind. a lighted bar Barrel was sat afloat from the ship at night which appeared Brilliant at sea. Jan 9th cloudy & cold. smooth sea & fair breeze. We are about enter- ing the St George s channel. !!! Ho !!! Ho the cry of land land is herd from mast head. We went on to the forecastle & after straining our eyes for a few moments we got sight of it. It was the Irish Coast lying 3 points to our lee bow. this is the first land we have seen for 20 days. At 8 oclock PM the revolving lamp at the lighthouse a cape clear came in full view. 10th The mountains of the Irish coast, & also 6 or 7 sail is in ful view weather cloudy, & rather cold. We walked the deck untill 9 oclock viewing the light houses &c. 11th We had a heavy gale commenced at one oclok in the morning. We were in danger having the Irish coast on one side ^the^ coast &^of^ wales on the other. their was a great bustle & noise on board from the captain, Mates, sailors, winds & waves &c. We reached the pilote ground at daylight & raised colours for a pilot... a pilot Boat soon appea[r]ed & came along side & sent a pilot on board of us, who arived in the midst of the gale. The pilot informed the captain that the steam ship Liverpool had not yet arived & she left New York 5 days befor[e] we did. & that the packet ship Independance had not reached Liverpool & she left New York 10 days before us. This intelligence created a great shout of rejoicings on board the ship, for it was the first time that they had known a steam ship, beaten by a packet ship. but the intelligence was no sooner commun[ic]ated before the steam ship Liverpool [here] in sight behind us & was gaining upon us. The pilot ordered the sails to be unreefed notwithstanding it was blowing or gale & we were soon out of sight of the Liverpool again. We had not sailed but a short time with this speed before the town of Liverpool in England was in sight & an English steam Boat soon came & took us in tow & soon brought us along side of the quay in Liverpool upon which stood thousands of human beings looking to see us land. the steam ship Liverpool came up just as we landed & fired two salutes of cannon at us as she past by. & Also the packet ship Independance came in in a few minutes after. It was truly a singular circumstance that the Oxford, steam ship Liverpool, & Independance should all reach the quay at Liverpool within 20 minutes of each other, when one left N.Y. 5 days & the other 10 before the Oxford but so it was  Thus you see after 22 days sail we arived safe in Liverpool in good health & spirits & for the first time I began to tread the soil in Old England. We took a walk into the streets of Liverpool. & visited some of the  most Noted places of the Town, such as New Market, Custom House, Lord Nelsons Monument, &c. all of which were splendid. The Market contained a vast variety of evry kind of meats, fish, fowls, & vegitables that I ever saw The Custom House was built of hewn stone in the form of an H and covered four acres of grouned. Lord Nelson s Monument is all of Brass about 14 feet high & 3 rods around it their is 4 large personages as large as life with a chain around their necks ^hands^ with one end of it in the mouth of a Lion, these are 4 Kings that Lord Nelson subdued in his day. Lord Nelson stands above those 4 Kings holding 4 crowns [FIGURES] in his hand, & death stands by his side partly covered with a shroud with one hand upon his Body. these are some of the prominent features of Lord Nelsons monument though there are others of miner consequence. He was killed in batle while commanding his fleet, his monument is much Noted in England. Their is not as much taste in general in pollishing, painting, & garnishing the out side of the buil- -ldings in the cities & towns in England as in America, but they build more for duribility, their buildings are far more expensive than in America, for they are composed of vast masses of huge stone or brick, though some of their buildings are far more spe^l^ended than those of America. Their is one thing vary disagreeable throughout England, the whole hemisphere or air is filled with smoke, smut, & gases, that rise from the dens population & burning of coal &c., the air is vary heavy & bad for the lungs, but the weather is not cold as in America, it is quite mild weather notwithstanding England is in 51 to 55 degrees North Lat I have not seen a flake of snow since I left New York is^t^ is 3,500 miles from  New York to Liverpool. Jan 12 Sunday I attended meeting at St Pauls Church, St Thomases Church which is the church of England I thought it vary singular to hear the Rector's, & Curit s preach against a form of Godliness without the power theirof & professing religion without having the fruits of it. while perhaps their is no people more formal than themselves. In the evening I attended meeting at Pitt street methodist chapel, the speaker appeared quite co[z]y & simple in his manners. All of the above named churches were 
 quite splendid with the pulpit or stand in or near the centre of the house which is the english custom. Another thing has attracted my attention while visiting public places in England ie a great plainness of dress with both rich & poor male & female, their cloth may be equally as good if not better than that worn in America but they do not appear as tasty & flashy. I think the Americans pattern more after the French than English in their dress. The Encllish deposit their dead in vaults in the church yard & them lay the grave stons flat upon the ground over their dead which forms a pavement to walk upon so you walk over the ded as you go in & out of church. Jan 13th Monday our trunks had to be taken from the ship & go to the custom House & by examined by the Officer. & after much jaming, crouding and  rocking about, we were permitted to depart with our trunks & baggage after paying 16 ^pence^ sterling on evry pound of Books & papers that were American that we had with us. We then took the rail road at Liverpool for preston. & for the first mile the cars   run under ground on a track that was cut out of a solid Rock, while buildings & inhabitants were over our heads. The cars run rapid in England. we arived in Preston, Lancashire, England. at 8 oclok P.M on this 13th day of Jan 1840 in the midst of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & I soon had Elder W. Richards by the hand & it was truly a happy meeting. I felt to rejoice to once more behold this Brother face to face & all the Saints who flocked around us with great rejoicings, after spending most of the night in con versation I retired to rest. 14th Preston contains a population of 60,000 the streets are crouded with the poor going to & from the the factories wearing wooden or clog shoes which makes a great ratling over the pavement. The poor here in England I should think were under as great Bondage as the children of Egypt Israel in Egypt. We held a council at Elder Richards house in Preston on Jan 17th & the following was one of the Resolutions post. Resolved that Elder's John Tailor & Joseph Fielding go to Liverpool & Elders Hiram Clark & Wm Clayton labour in Manchester & Elder Willi^a^rd Richards tarry in Preston & its neighbourhood & Willford Woodruff & Theadore Turley go to the Potteries & warn the People in that place & then inquire the mind of the Lord & if it is his will go to Birmingham. The potteries contain a population of 65,000 persons & Birmingham 300,000 & the place is larger than New york & is in the centre of England 18th I took the parting hand with the Saints in Preston & in company with Elders Turley and Clark took the rail car & rode to Manchester 36 miles whare we were soon greeted by Elder William Clayton & many Saints. Manchester is a vary beatiful Town containing a Pop of 280,000 souls & is as large as New york on the ground. It already has a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in it, with 164 members & the work still rolling on. It is the Metropolis of the cotton manifactoring district in England. I had not been in the place but a few minutes before I was called upon with my Brother to visit a sister possessed with the devil & a burning fever. When we arived at the house she was in great rage & required 3 or 4 men to keep her from taring herself to peaces. We lade hands upon her & commanded the devil to come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ & also rebuked the fever & after a mighty struggle the devil came out of her, & the fever left her, & she was come [calm] & composed. The devel entered into her child next morning & made it stiff as a stake. we lade hands upon the child & rebu[k]ed the devil in the name of Jesus Christ & he instantly came out & the child fell asleep, & the woman attended meeting during the day I do not speak of these things boasting, but thank my Heavenly Father that he is rebuking the devourer for our sakes. 19th Sunday I preached to day in Manchester to a crouded congregation, it is the first time that I have preached the gospel in England the people gave good attention, many that were sick came forward to be healed, we lade hands upon 20 most of which were healed. The ordinance of Baptism was also administered. Jan 21st I left Manchester & in company with Elder Turley took coach & road (on the outside as the custom is) through Stockport, Mackelsfield, Congleton, Tunstell, & to Burslem at the Potteries & spent the night with Elder Alfred Corden This is our place of labour for a few days or weeks. I am now in the midst if the Potteries which are so noted in England whare most of the English china, crockery & stone were ware is made Pop. 65,000. Their ^x^ is an Elder lives in this town by the name of Alfred Cordon he went 40 miles to recieve the work & be baptzed & was ordained an Elder. he works in the potter^i^es in Burslem 6 days in a week for his daily bread & preaches evry evening in a week & 3 times on Sunday & he has alredy a little flock of Saints of 66 in number around him. When We arived in England we found the churches under excellent order & dissipline; the Saints have the utmost confidence in their Elders, knowing they are the servants of God. consequently they give strict heed to their teachings. We soon expect most of the Twee^l^ve in this country. We shall then hold a general conference, & my prayer to God is that all of the Quorum of the Twelve that come^c^ome from America will have means to come soon & labour while the day last for I believe that what we do in Old England must be done quickly. Elders Mullenner & Wright are in Scotland have began to preach & to Baptize. Elder Wright has had the small pox since he went to Scotland, & the doctors told him to take medicine & keep warm or die, but he took no medicine continued to go about his business was but little sick & soon got well. persecution does not rage much yet in England, sometimes the Elders get the candlesticks & candles flung at their heads while preaching & occasionally stoned in the streets but in general good attention is paid. Jan 24 I preached  in the town of Stoke Elder Turley followed me two were Baptzed. 25th Sunday I preached in Burslem & Elder Turley in Hanley. We Baptzed 3 persons. We have crouded & att[en]ti[ve] congregations. We have now sent out appointments in a number of new places in the adjoining towns. We have found it to be the will of God to open a door immediately in Birmingham which is about 50 miles from these potteries, one of us will go there day after tomorrow probably Elder Turley, we are determined to immediately erect the standard in evry town from the potteries to Birmingham which is a number of large towns & vary populous & whare they have not as yet herd the word at all, But it will give at least one million of souls the privili^e^ge of hearing the word. I think some of making Birmingham my stand for labour for a seasons as it is mear the centre of  England & contains a large number of inha bitants & will open a vast field of labour beteen the potteries & Birmingham. & we have already given out appointments part of the way. My Dear Wife As I have taken up most of this sheet in giving you an account of our journey & of the country &c. I will now give some general remarks concerning the signs of the times & the vineyard of the Lord in this Eastern country. Signs, wonders, & fearful sights are appearing, & the words of the Ancient & modern Prophets are fulfillings in this land Eearthquakes are following each other in quick succession, fires are vary frecquent. A great light lately appeared in London  so that the fireman with their Engines rushed to one part of the city supposed it to be on fire but found it to be in the heavens. At Kanturk Dec 26, 1839 300 acres of Col Lonford s bog land rose up from its mighty bed & travled with the rapidity  of a steam Engine for the distance of a steam 4 miles through the country carrying destruction in its progress rising in  angry surges like the ungovernable sea heaving from 10 to 30 feet of Earth upon the land in many places as it past over  & in addition to these & many other signs awful awful is the state of things thoroughout England, hundreds of thousands of people have met together in different places against the government or determined to have a reform in the government they are called chartist or radicals. the Queen & parliment depend upon the Ma^i^litia to to protect them, & they have to be vary busy to break up the plots which are lade to break out in a civel  war. Thousands are in a state of almost utter starvation, whole families are going th[r]ough the streets begging Bread from dore to dore. hundreds of people in one town will be turned out of the factories & out of  Employ & bread in one day, & I see them standing in large groups at the corners of the streets consulting  what to do, & in fact the whole face of the Earth is ripened in iniquity & sin as well as trouble & distress & it appears as though the earth was ownly spared for a little season that the worning voice may go through. The English Publications of late have given an account of the excitement of the Radical question &c. for my part I have nothing to do with any of these matters of the government any further than to exhort the Saints to be as quiet as possible & be subject to the Laws of the Land & the powers that be. but it  requires the greatest of prudence & wisdom to hold public meetings & do the work of God in this country at the present time & under the present state of things. But I believe the harvest of Old England is fully ripe & must spedily be 
 be reapted if the wheat is sowed. & God is a[s]sisting his servents in this country, & the work is begining to roll forth  more & more whare it is faithfully proclaimed & signs do truly follow believers for which we feel thankful. I  believe that churches will spedily be esstablished in London, Liverpool, Birmingham & that all of the capitol  places of England will hear the sound of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There appears to be many looking for truth  to come forth from some quarter & they appear willing to hear, receive & imbrace it when it comes unto  them & while we are preaching & baptizing such as shall be saved in England our Brethren have also began to  preach & baptize in Scotland & thus the work rolls on. pray for us that our work may be finished spedily that truth may prevail upon the face of the earth. We hold a meeting every evening in a week & several times on the  Sabbath & baptize almost daily. Jan 27th I preached last night in Burslem to a crowded congregation & a man  came forward with two constables as I was informed to keep the peace while he read a pamphlet containing Mormon- ism unveiled W Parish s letters P. P. Pratts letters, signed Luke Johnson, & John F Boyanton [Boynton]. &c &c I was informed  the man was a Methodist preacher & brought the constables with him because he feared the people. We helped him  to read it what we could by giving him lights, & water to quench his thirst. I think on the whole it did no injury I answered him when he got through, & the people herd my answer with attention. All stories & reports that were  afloat in America are now going the rounds in England, but they will ownly stir the people up to come  out & hear &c. but I will leave this part of the subject. I have many things I wish to say to you, but  you see that I have touched upon a variety of things appertaining to my journey, the country & the vine yard of the Lord &c in this land. B[u]t I will now say that I feel exceding anxious to hear from you  by some means or other, yes my desire to recceve a letter from you is vary great. for I have never recceved  but one letter from you since I left Montrose the 8th day of last August, I have written 7 or  8 letters to you since I left you how many of them you have obtained I know not. I feel vary  anxious to hear from you & Sarah Emma & also about the Church around you, perhaps you may have written some letters that may be on the way that I may yet get I hope this is the case. I want  you to write as soon as you get this, wont you & give me an account of all matters & things  with you & Sarah, how your health is, & how you get along for help; food & rament, is their war between  Missouri & Ioway, tell all the news of a National character, I herd New Orleans was destroyed by  the Mississppi River is it so, how is the Saints getting along in Montrose, Lovely Street, & Commerce  tell me all about it. are they publishing the times & Seasons. give my respects to all the friend[s] in Lovely Street, Mo[n]trose, & Commerce as far as you have an opportunity. Elder T[aylor]  [page torn]   sent a letter home [to] [page torn] his family a few days since in Commerce. I expect Elder Taylor h[as] [page torn]  written to his family by this time. Remember me to all of our friends unto who you [page torn] write. I shall not have time to send many as lengthy letters as this to America, but I shall endea vour to give you an account of all important matters with me. & I hope you will write to  [m]e a[s] often as you can conveneintly please drect your next letter to Mr Willford Woodruff  in care of Alfred Cordon ^Club Buildings^ Navigation road at Mr Godwin s works, Burslem, Staffordshire England. It is a long direc^t^ion I know but it is my place of address at present, please pay the postage to New York or it will not come but if paid there it will come safe. I will also pay the postage on the letters that I write to you as far as N.Y.  also. I will direct this letter to Commerce Illinois & diret the post Master to inform you of it  I do this lest their should be some difficulty about the post Office at Montrose. I do not value the writing of a lengthy letter letter like this if you ownly obtain it. & I do pray my heavenly Father that you may obtain this letter. & that it may n[o]t [page torn] be written in vain. Phebe I hope I shall continue to share in  your prayers, remember me consta[n]tly [page torn] at the Throne of grace that I may have Wisdom, grace, & fa[ith] [page torn]  according to my day: & I do pray the Lord to Bless you, with health & strength & suppoort you in  the midst of all troubles, trials, temptations, afflictions & distress untill the end come when we may enter unto that rest together which remains for the people of God. Jan 29th I held a meeting last evening in New Castle & preached to an attentive congregation one offered himself for Baptzm. I have this morning visited  the large silk factory in New Castle & seen them make silks from the ball or raw article to the weavers loom whare ribbons, sattins, & silks, are finished. I have since walked to Burslem 3 miles though Parks, lanes, fields, & while the sun  shines beatiful & pleasant, the parks, walks, & fields, are as green as they would be in the month of May in America. I sit  down this morning to finish this Letter as I cannot write as lengthy letter as this at once for I am broke  of by many calls, so I have had several spells about it. & now Phebe wont you sit down & do so by me give  me a kind of a journal or history of all things with you [&] Sarah. E. since I left you ie if you are able, git a large sheet & fill it full. I want to know about the sickness & who is dead. & what Joseph & Sidney done at Washington & what the prospect is concerning the Church & its progress in America. What news have you from our friends in Maine remember me to all of Father Carters family when you write. I do not know that you will be able to read all of this letter but make it out as well as you can. please keep this letter & not lose it as I shall wish to see it when I come home. I do not yet know how long my mission will be in England but I calculate to labour faithfully while I do labour that I may the sooner get through & again meet with my family But my Dear Friend & Companion let us try to be resigned to the will of God in all things relative to our seperation for a season, for it is to do the work of God, to fill a responsible station in preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ & warn the people of this generation, & prune the vineyard once more, that the children of God may be pre-   [page torn] [-pai]red for the coming of the Son of Man. & if we are faithful in this great work, & do the will of Jesus Christ & are  wise stewards over the things commtted to our charge, the war will soon be ended & the victory won, then how sweet will be our rest, how great our glory, how rich our  reward & how Eternal our happiness. & May the Lord  Jesus Christ intercede for us, & all Saints that we may overcome through the Blood of the Lamb that when he  comes we may be like him & reign with him upon the Earth which may our Heavenly Father grant for Christs sake Amen  I remain forever your Companion & Friend  Willford Woodruff  Phebe W.

I owe you many apologies for not earlier answering your kind letter of the 20th Ult. ins I have written to my family in the city but once since I left, and have seen my wife in Sanpete but about three times since the President was here. I have been  very busy in building me a house and in preaching the gospel. Away from home I seldom could find a decent pen, or a half sheet of clean paper. I have written a little through necessity and a very little only. I might urge many othr reasons for not writing sooner, but none for want of a disposition to write. I have not had time even to write a love letter, however strong my in- clinations may have been to do so. I never labor ed with body and mind more intently in my life than during the past season. I Am now reduced to the size of a decent man. But my house is so far finished that my goods are pitched into it, and have left my family to regulate for themselves while I go to Fillmore where I  expect to be on New Years night. I am now on my way there.  Accept my thanks for your Kind attention to my vineyard. It was a swamp

We have had a beautifully mild season until Wednesday last when the snow fell very freely and it became intensly cold. We have no wind storms to do us any serious damage in the county with the exception of about one third of the roof of the Meeting house at Fort Ephraim which was blown off by reason of a door being left open and the house being tight, it had to burst. But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustained by our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that no human lives were lost. Speaking of Judgments, the Lord said, "My saints shall hardly escape." Sickness and death are our common lot; and though the summons be direct against us or our best friends, we have to obey the mandate Sickness is only one trial to prepare us for glory, and death the gate through which the just enter into it.  Bro. Gibson, of whom you speak, is something more than a political Mormon, I hope. He has an extensive mission. I hope he may do good, he can do no harm to  the cause.  The road from the North Bend to Spanish Fork is worked through for horsemen and empty wagons, but to make it a good and safe thoroughfare, will require very much more labor. Many of the citizens here have petitioned for an appropriation to work it through. Not, however, by my counsel or suggestion, not but that such a measure is desirable to me; but I think the Legislation has appropriated too much already for individual aggrandizement with the view of public good. I have counseled the people to forward their 
 Petitions to Hon G. A. Smith instead of forwarding them to a man who, after voting for a measure, turns round and says, "you can't do any thing it is the height of nonsense to ask two dollars a bushel for wheat when it can be bought for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter." We want men who can do something. "You can't, you can't" never built, even, a house of Commons, let a lone the Kingdom of God. But when stray cattle are required to pay private liabilities, the tone changes to, "I can, I can." This is no priva cy. It  Two weeks ago today, I preached just such a discourse in Manti as I hinted to them that I should th in the second discourse that I preached there. It made quite a fluttering in some quarters, yet the masses of the people brightened as though ten tuns burthen had been removed from their shoulders. Many were in tears, others smiled, some as white as ghosts while the power of God enabled me to tell things about as existing evidence will substantiat[e] them. One remarked that that discourse caused many a drooping branch to lift up its head It was a faithful warning to evil doers.  When a legal Governor vetoes the acts of an illegal Legisla ture, it is as 'twas; and 'twas as 'tis  Lincoln is Elected, and God's will in that is done. The times are becoming quite interesting. The Lord help  all parties on in the way they want to go.  The people are gathered for meeting so I must stop writing and go to preaching  6 o'clock Sunday evening and all is well. Your Brother in the gospel  Orson Hyde 
 P.S. I perceive by the News that Bro Gardner Snow of Manti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He is a very good man; but is completely wraped up in his son Warren and in George Peacock. The people of Sanpete have paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvements can be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. It is like all improvements in Manti, unfineshed. Several Back houses have been begun, but I know not one finished The jail in like condition. $4,500 was the contract price for completeing it, as I am told, when $2,000 would build and complete a much better building than that would be of finished The county is greatly in debt, and no improvements that are of much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered, the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has suffered The people have suffered by their stoks [stock] being made into strays and then into beef. The Indian department has suffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations going in the same way. The people of Sanpete think the Bourbons have reigned long enough, and that Bornbas Dynasty should end. If the county seat were removed forom Manti to Moroni or to Springtown it would suit the notions of the people much better. If to Moroni M. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown, Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I have expressed no opinion here as to the removal of the county seat, neither any with regard to this choice of a Judge yet the above are my true sentiments and 19 twentieths of the people here would endorse them, the opinion of our representative to the contrary notwithstanding 
 Elder W. Woodruff said the only way for the Committee to do was for them to do just what Prest. Young wanted them to do let us unite and cooperate as a people, and turn out our means to relieve Prest. Young, and become part owners of the Railroad --  the Lord has blest us, and we are all better off, than ever before and let us find out what our duty is and then do it -- He was willing to do all he could himself &c 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff Strongly recommended the brethren to exercise Faith and prayer for Governor Chaffer, the Judges and the other members of the ring. & that the Lord would overrule their acts for the good of Israel. 
 Elder W. Woodruff regarded this school was one of the greatest priveleges the Elders can enjoy we are taught here how to build up the Kingdom of God we can see the hand of God in inspiring his servant Brigham in opening this school, the Cooperative movement &c which soon developed a secret of plot of apostacy And which had been revealed to Prest Young some time before it was making made manifest.  The cup of this Nations iniquity will soon be filled up, and the judgments of God will break it to pieces.  He then read a little from page 79 Doc & Cov. and by making comparisons with what is found in the Bible, Book of Mormon & Doc & Covr. pertaining to Father Adam, as to ^who^ he was &c, we can learn much that will strengthen our faith & comfort our hearts.  Dad by day the Gentiles who are constantly coming up to Zion, are fulfilling the scriptures. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said the Lord intends  to build up Zion, but the enemy is so  far on the alert, that we may expect  to be met on all sides. the Land question  is very important, and should not be neglected,  or we will suffer by it. Ours is a  constant warfare, and has been from the  beginning. we have got to watch and  guard ourselves, lest the enemy gets an  advantage over us.  4  God was going to build up Zion on this Land  and we ought to carry out the counc^i^l of his  Servants. We had got to Labour, and cease  to sustain the enemies of our God.  Though the Government, through its Officials are seeking to destroy every constitutional right, and deprive us of them, they will certainly  find it a dear bought effort, for if we do our  duty, God will frustrate their plans, and bring  them to shame. 
 He hoped every Elder & boy in Israel, will have a good rifle and ammunition, all in readiness to defend ourselves and families, that God and Angels may see that we are willing to do anything that is required of us  but He for one had great Faith in prayer  let every saint bear up before the Lord those who are in our midst seeking to destroy us he believed God will not only hear, but answer the prayers of his Saints, which are offered up in earnestness & faith. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff said we have not sufficiently  realized our responsibilitys as parents or members of  the church, though he himself had always been  used to work, and his wives and children also  had to work and be industrious, it was not  right for us to allow our children to be out late  at night, and mingle with evil associations. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff had visited Fort Herriman  preached there, and attended a party   He bitterly complained of conduct which he  had been eyewitness to in Bp Gardners ward ^at a party^ and was sorry that Bp Gardner was not present to day Bishops ought to be the most  honest of any people in the Territory and  especially those who have charge of cooperative  stores, and not permit their wives and  daughters to draw goods out of the store  without Keeping out any account of it   Bp Gardner ought to be had before Bp Hunter and tried for such conduct  in permitting such deviltry to exist in his ward. 
 they should be taught to respect and honour their parents.  He was truly thankful for the institution of Sabbath  Schools, and our children should be sent there to learn the principles and doctrine of Christ.  Some of us will soon pass away, and the  responsibilities of the Kingdom of God, will fall  upon the heads of our children, therefore they  should be instructed in everything that pertains  to the government of God. Zion will conquer,  and prevail, and our duties ^which^ are ^of^ the most  various kinds, if we will only attend to them, we shall gain an experience that will qualify  us for increasing usefulness. We should teach  our wives, (in our absence) to pray with their fa children, and teach them to be honest.  also, that when they find anything, it is not  theirs, but seek to find the owner.  We have been greatly blest, and softened the  hearts of men in our behalf in times past, and if we do right, God will give our ^us^ power  to retain our possessions and keep the balance  of power in this city. 
  Elder W. Woodruff  sanctioned the remarks  of the previous speaker, said no one living  in the Zion of Enock would make promises  and not fulfill them, and before we can  enter into the order of Enock, we have got  to practise the principle of righteousness 
 Elder W. Woodruff was glad to hear the voice  of Prest Young's voice again, to listen to his councils -  the Spirit of God had been with Prest Wells h during his absence. He also refered to the wicked  world who are much opposed to the Kingdom  of God as ever, there [h]as been a strong combination  among the wicked to bring us into trouble during  the past winter, but we have been preserved, and  have met in our School, Tabernacle & Ward Houses,  without interruption. It was also a wise sugges- tion of Prest Young to introduc^e^tion the use of oxen  for during much of our labour instead of Horses  as a source of economy.  He also named a few things about the mines. the hand of the Lord was in it, and much good  would come out of it. Let farmers cultivate  the soil, and every mechanic cleave to his mechanism 
 Elder W. Woodruff said we should watch and pray  and especially deposit our votes on Monday next, and  use every means to influence others do the same. 
 if every man would fulfil their their promises  to each other, confidence will be increased both Joseph Smith & prest. Young have taught  us the principles of Honesty and Integrity  and we should try to carry them out.  The rules of the School are just and good, and we should observe them.  We cannot be saved in the Celestial Kingdom  of God, unless we practise principles of  righteousness & Honesty it does not pay  any of us to do wrong He teaches his children to be honest, and he believes they  will grow up as Honest men.  We must not encourage our children to do  wrong, if we do, they are lit almost sure  to make it manifest as they grow up. Let us set good examples before our wives  and children.  He then recommended the brethren to get up  what Horses or Cattle they have over Jordan,  if not, we shall certainly lose them, for their  is no feed for them there.  Put them in Cooperative Herds where  they can be taken where proper care of 
 by and bye, we shall see the wisdom that God  has in permitting them to be opened here & there  He had been absent a few days looking  out a Herd ground for a Cooperative Herd,  and hoped the brethren would rally round the  effort and help it along.  Zion will arise, and triumph on the face  of the earth, and all opposition will have  to give way, and the Kingdom will be built  up. We must attend to our prayers, and our  works must be good, and we shall have a home  here, and the wicked and ungodly will have no power to prevent it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff felt thankful that he  lived to see the commencement of a  grand cooperative movement, which  he had no doubt would continue  until it circumscribed the whole of our  temporal matters. We should learn  to sustain ourselves, and leave off as fast  as possible the patronage of our enemies.  Let alone those who support our bitter  enemies. He heartily endorsed this movement,  and prayed that we might grow brighter and  brighter. Motioned & Seconded, & Carried  That the Constitution be accepted and  the Books be opened for subscription. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said the nearer we  get to the Lord, the more mercy we see displayed  towards erring humanity - hence it is that  Prest Young entertains the most merciful feelings towards those who have done wrong  and would gladly assst towards reclaiming  them. And he for one did not feel like  saying anything to oppose it 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff Gave out a notice of a 1/4 Sec. of land  in the Pulsipher field, and requested all landowners of  that 1/4 Section to meet at the close of the School, as some- thing had to be done, or the land would be lost. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff  said, our success  as a people depended on our faithfulness  in keeping the commandments of God. Neither the Ancient Saints, nor the latter day  Saints can obtain ^the^ blessings of God on  any other principle.  No principle was ever revealed to the  Sons of Men, but what was intended  for their observance.  He believed their was sufficient integrity  however ^among the saints^ who are doing their best in  obeying the laws of God, to preserve us  from the hands of the wicked.  He had great faith in Prayer, and re- commended the school to bear up continually  before the Lord, the anointed of God. told up He once heard a simple, fervent  prayer offered in Circle by the Prophet  Joseph when in deep trouble, and was  answered in three days.  We should also pray for our enemies, for if ever any poor devils needed praying  for, the Judges, Lawyers, &c in our midst  needed it. Let us be valient for the  truth and stand up like men in the  cause of Zion 
 Elder W. Woodruffrecommended us to travel in travel shallow water, and not to trouble ourselves  about the mysteries that are all around us-  spoke of the increase of infidelity among  the nations of the world.  Let any one deny the Holy Ghost and  the atonement of Jesus Christ, then the  Devil leads them to lead shed innocent blood. 
 Elder W. Woodruff gave a graphic account of his  experience with a very severe Snow Storm, on his  way from Randolph to Evanston, having to travel some 15 miles in the Storm, and after a very  providential opening, he reached Ogden, and  finally to this City, in health and strength, for  which he acknowledges the hand of the Lord.  It is our duty to trust in God, be diligent, and faithful & true in all our duties to God  and each other, and the Kingdom will be  established in spite of all the opposition  that is now arrayed against it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff said ever since he was a little  boy, he never could think there was anybody on  the earth that loved the Lord, unless there was a  Head and body of the Church, which is so  beautifully exprest by the Apostle Paul.  He had observed a greadt many cripples in his  life, some lacking one limb and some another-  but he never say ^saw^ any without a Head- so with  the Christian world, having no Head, are without  life, just as much as a natural body, without  a Head  one. He was not at all surprised  at the persecution we are receiving, he was astonished that we did not have more, but God will bring  us off victorious. Since we had openly come  out with the principle of Polygamy, God had  thrown a shield around us, and protected us. 
 Elder W. Woodruff  said the Lord never fails in any  promise that he gives to the children of men.  He deals with men in on the most broad demo cratic principles. The Law that God has revealed to  us in this day, is easily understood by the most  illiterate this Law of the Gospel was given that  man might be brought back into his presence, and  exalted in the Celestial Kingdom, but the human  family must abide the Law, as or they cannot  gain the promise. He felt to rejoice that Prest. Young was here with us again when he was first  arrested, he said, that all their efforts would turn out  a great fizzle the Prayers of the servants of God  have prevailed, and God has delivered those ^who^ were in bonds. We should never lose sight of the promises, and so live, that we can lawfully claim them.  When Pres.t Young first set foot on this temple block, he  put down his cane upon it and said, Here the greater  Temple of God will be built.  No man who has l ever lifted up his hand against  this Kingdom, as ever pro^s^pered. No weapon that  was ^is^ formed against Zion can prosper. this prophecy  has been most remarkably fulfilled.  We shall prosper, if we keep the commandments of  God-the Hand of God has been over us as a  people. 
 The Nation we live in, has become corrupt with  Whoredoms, Thieving, & every foul crime that will  shortly sink it to perdition. It may be that the  highest tribunal in the land, viz The Supreme Court,  may also be induced to turn against us -- the  President has tried his hand, and perhaps Congress  may legislate against us -- but the Lord will bring us off victorious. And this nation  will fill up the measure of their iniquity. 
 souls into the Church than any one man in the Church; I do not know how that is. I brought two thousand into the Church in the south of England- in Herefordshire, &c., in 1840; but I never felt to boast or to take any credit to myself in any of these things, for it was God not Wilfeord Woodruff that did it. Yet I felt it was a great blessing to be an instrument in the hands of God of performing siuch a work. So I look upon you young brethren who are sent now to the nations of the earth to preach the gospel and save the souls of men.  No greater or more glorious work could you be called to.  Therefore, my dear brother, take hold with all your might. Call upon the Lord in mighty prayer for the Holy Ghost to be with you to give you power to preach the Gospel and give you souls in search of your ministry, and the Lord will hear your prayers and give you power to accomplish a good mission which will be a satisfaction to yourself and your friends and acceptable unto God who has called you. And this applies not only to yourself, but to every Elder with you, and all who are in the vineyard of the Lord. Therefore, fear not, but labor faithfully to prune the vineyard once more for the last time and prepare the earth for the coming of the Son of Man. Avoid all evil, resist all temptations, and the angels of God will be your constant companions.  Give my love and blessing to Prest. Naegle and wife and all the Elders with you. I am interested in the welfare of every Elder laboring in the vineyard of the Lord.  Spencer Clawson's wife died last week, and will be buried on Sunday. I would be glad to hear from you and know how you are getting along. Sister Woodruff, Blanch and Alice join me in love to you and Bro. and Sister Naegle.  From your Brother in the Gospel,  Wilford Woodruff

 De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontor for den skandinaviske Mission. Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn, Sept. 12 1893.  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear Brother:  When I was appointed to take charge of the Scandinavian Mission, May 1st Bro. Joseph Christiansen turned over to me as "Resources,"  a list of notes due this Offise from parties now in Utah, which notes, according to your suggestions had been sent to you for colection, in order to help this office out with the much needed funds.  I write this by way of a reminder. I will also state, that during the last few months but very little money has been sent from home, to this office for Emigrations; The few emigrants that has goen this summer, has mostly goen on money that has been to thier or here for a long time, and as stated above, but very little has come from home to Reimburse the office.  We have had several calls from home for money, that has been sent here for Emigrations, but when the parties, for whom it was intended could not go "at once", the money was recalled.  I suppose because of the hard times at home and the scarcity of money. All this has drained us interely and we are not now able to remit to Liverpool the full amounts for the emigrations as they go.  If 
 De Sidste-Dages Helliges Hovedkontor for den skandinaviske Mission. Sankt Pauls Gade Nr. 14, 1. Sal.  Kjebenhavn, _____, 189_____  we had the cash which these notes represents then we would be allright as far as the emigrations is concerned.  I expect Prest. Lund over here next week and I shall then take great plasure in showing him the condision of the mission financily,  I hope to hear from you favorably on this matter. The work of God is progressing in this lands, many are investigating the Gospel afpecialy in Norway and Sweden and if we only had more missionaries to send up there much more good could be done.  I remain yours in the Gospel of christ  C. A. Carlquist  Bro. Jack sayes, we are doing the best we can to collect those notes, but in these hard times, no one seems able to pay,  and there is but little hope of getting the money just now.  Besides the Copenhagen office has drawn on the Lpool office and the latter has drawn on this office, and will no doubt continue to do so.  J. F. S.

Brother Anderson came here last  May and was according to your wish, sent to the  City of Stockholm, where he gained admittance to the  best school in this country for the study which he  was to pursue Figure Molding. When Prest. Lund  and I visited Stockholm conference last fall we had  several talks with brother Anderson and learned  that he was progressing very rapidley, using  every opertunity offered for study.  The teachers  seems to take a special interest in him and he  feels that the Lord has His hand in this   Praying God to bless us all in our efforts to  do good I remain your brother in the Gospel  C.
