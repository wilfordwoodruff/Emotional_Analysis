Of necessity my address this  evening must be short. Yet I will touch upon a few prominent items  which I consider important to the subject in which I feel deeply interested  There are certain events which stand forth in bold relief of deep  interest in the history of evry nation under heaven. Therefore the History of the Indians or there present condition has also a deep interest  an interest of greater importance than at first presents itself to the mind of the American People Although it may appear to them as coverd with  A cloud or buried deep from their view yet it none the less exhists.   Then listen to me. I have deeply studied the situation and interest of my  brethren the Red men for years and I have resolved to call aloud upon the  white men of this Nation to give ear to my Petitons. If you do not see the Indian Orator in your midst making a displey of oratory like the  white man it is not because he has not talent but because he has not a chance to exercise it   1th My object in visiting the United States is to present A petition to  this Government that they may assist me in concentrating the Indians  together that they may live and not die I want Congress to grant them  a portion of Territory that they can call their own and be concentrated upon it that they not be driven from it any more. They once were  the owners and occupiers of the whole soil of all North America. The white man came and removed the Indians and continually driven them  untill they can see no hope but the grave before them. I now ask in their behalf a Territory to settle them upon that they may have a permanent  home forever And come under the United States Government  let them have some form of Government and become part and  parcel of the United States. In this matter I have studied the interest of all both the white and red men   1st Give them a Territory that they can call their own where  the children can point to the graves of their fathers and say we can  now live in Peace and be driven no more. We can visit the graves of  our fathers with none to drive us from them and they will be inspired  to engage in evry laudable undertaking that now marks the course of the white man   2nd You can then esstablish schools among them  that will be of benefit to them, they would obtain knowledge and  would make a good use of it. The gospel could then be introduced  among them and they would be far more ready to recieve it when they find the white man is consistant and willing to do them  good, but when the white man offers the gospel to the Indian one year and the next comes dand drives him from his home and the grave of his Fathers He has no faith or confidence in either the white man or his gospel   3rd You can then introduce agriculture  among them and they will recieve it for they would then see of necessity they must cultivate the land or die they could not depend upon  game for support and they would turn their attention to cultivating  the soil make improvements and take delight in the same dway as the white man   4th They would then be in a position whare they would be  deliverd from the Ill consequences of constant removing which has continually   ENDENTRY followed them for many years. And The Ill consequences of removing  have been multiplied and vary great. This has been one main reason  why schools have been unproductive of good among them. This is  also whone reason why Missionaries have done no more good among them The Indians are fast decreasing and Passing away what is the cause of all this. There are various causes Their constant remov- ing is one cause. Disease which has been introduced among them  By white men in the capacity of traders, missionaries, and Emigrants  Also the introduction of Alchoohol have had a tendency to waste them away. Also wars among themselves and wars with white men all of  which have continually wasted away the Indan tribes   I will here remark that in the origin of the wars with the whites  the conducting of those wars and in the treaties of peace made And  broaken the Indians have been badly treated and abused by the whites. For instance some ruffian or trader visites the Indians introduces wild fire or Alcohol among them and will get the Indians drunk and pehaps drunk himself and will cheat them in any way  he can And perhaps kill some of them and in his career he gets  killed himself, then the cry goes forth that the savage Indians are killings and murdering the inhabitants of the country. it is proclaim- ed in all the public Journals of the Union. Yes one side of the  story is proclaimed as with peals of thunder throughout the Earth  But no voice is raised in behalf of the poor Indian. their story  is not told the world hear it not they do not enquire or ask for it. But as soon as the story of the white man is told and proclaimed to the world, the armies of war must be prepared and soldiers sent forth to drive and Kill the Indians and burn their home  and in this way the most desolating and expensive wars have been  carried on for many years untill we feel it is time for the white man to take a different course with the Indians.   As an example of the bad Effects of continually removing the Indians I would refer you to the Cherokee Nation. That people were fast imprioving following rapidly in the footsteps of the white  man had extensive farms and good dwellings and continuallyed  rapidly advancing in improvements untill they were suddenly  brought to a stand in theire course by being cruelly called upon  by the state of Georgia to give up their lands and go away from the graves of their fathers into the wilderness and thus it was that  the mighty nation instead of recieving that support encouragement and comfort from the Nation that He ought to recieve was forced By  the cruel hand of oppression to bow their heads in sorrow and dispair as they wend their way to their so called home in the  wilderness whare they can find no other hope ownly to pass a few  more years in sorrow untill they shall be called to pass through the  same ordeal again to remove and remove untill they are anhilated  from off the face of the Earth. O Ye white man what incour- agement do you give the Indian to plant, to build, to learn, to  cultivate the Earth, or to recieve a Religion that professes love  mercy kindness and truth while those who profess to Enjoy it  deals out such deeds of oppression and cruelty upon the heads of the red men that it drives them to madness and Despair. Let the  American Nation stay their hand from this time forth in their oppression and drivings of the Indians lest they drive them beyound a point which  the Indian will endure and return a Blow upon the head of the  white man which will fill many a habitation with death. Once give the Indians A Territory A home whare they can have a full assurance   ENDENTRY that therier ears or those of their children will no more be  saluted with a call to remove from their lands then if they do not show forth a spirit of improvement then cast them  off as not worthy of your support or attention but untill then you are not justifyed yur garments are not clear   The spirit of the age and times demands that Congress should take immediate action upon theis matter.   1st The Indians cannot retain  their lands. Emigration of the white men are already surround- ing them and in their midst and the richness and fertility of the  Indians lands are a temptation to the white man and invite  him to settle thereon.   2nd The Indians have two much land  more than what they need to till and cultivate for their support  Let there be a Territory set off on the North west of Ioway North  of Missouri on which there is now no white settlement And let the Indians East of the Rocky moun- tains And in the United States be gatherd upon it. Then let other Territories in the west be appropriated And let all the Indians on the North American Continant be collected together and learned to cultivate the Earth. They will soon associate themselves  together, and cease their wors among themselves also with the white man. If there is not sumthing of this kind done the vast Emigration through all the Indians lands will soon  destroy the game and then want and starvation will ensue and this  will bring on war between the white and Red men.   If my Proposition is excepted by the American government  And they will carry it out it will be of vast benefit both to  the Indians And the people of the United States   1st The Benefit to the Indians will be it will give them a permanent  home, whare schools can be esstablished among them and  their children taught the English language. Farms can also be  opened among them and when they see they have a permanent  home for themselves and their children and they have no game  to depend upon for food they will immediately go to work and cultivate  the Earth like white men. The gospel can then be introduced among them to a good Effect and they will recieve it with  Thankfulness when they can be made to believe that then the hand that deals out the gospel to them is not laying a plan  to take the advantage of them and preparing a way to drive them from their home and country. It will also unite not ownly their  interest and attachment towards each other but their regard and interest  with that of the United States   The benefit to the Government is less expenses   1st Buying theire lands and Paying them yearly annuities whis  is costing the Government immens sums of money    2nd The contiunual transporting of Indians from place to place  there has already been 96000 indians removed by the govern- ment   3rd The keeping of many Indian Agents at great expens to Government could then be dispensed with    4th Fortifications have now to be erected ion the borders of all Indian  tribes with the Intention of keeping the Indians in subjection  these would not be needed of if the Indians were in a Territory of their own for by having their trail clear and no encroachments of the white man upon their borders there would be no cause of war or fortifications.   ENDENTRY Washington so on to lay my Petition before the Congress of the United States and urged them  to grant my Prayer for the benefit of both the white and Red men. I want your aid, I want you to sign my petition that the voice of thousands may be bheard in behalf of this petiontion. I want the names of Legeslators Governors and American citizens in General that my prayer  may be heard and answerd. Give the North American Indians A home, a place whare the soles of their feet can rest in peace then you will do your duty towards them, and place them in a situations whare you can teach them Literature, Agriculture, and Commerce, give them the chance the white man has, And I Prophesy in the name of the Lord that there will ere long be found among them their Philosophers, Franklins, and Washing- tons, who would do honor to any civillized or Christian Nation on the globe. But let this Nation turn a deaf ear to my Petitions and the Petitions of the Indians, continue  to oppress them and drive them to desperation, and the  hour is near when the campfire will be seen upon many a  hill. The war hoop will reache from one end of the Rocky Mountains to the other. The Indian will then sell his life  as dear as possible and deal out death whareever an opportunity offers. When this blow is struk It will be Terrible to all May God forbid that shch such a blow should fall at all, that the scenes of Bloody Brook should any more be enacted.   American Citizens it is to ward of this blow that I now stand before you, That I now call upon this Nation bearing a petition unto them, will you hear my Prayer, will you give the  Indian his rights, will you help bury the hate hat forever Or will you make a grave to bury your dead I leave you to DECIDE    The following is A true copy of the Petition   To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives The memorial of the undersigned citizens and Residence of the United  States Most Respectfully showeth That the present state of the Indian Tribes within the jurisdiction of the United States and the continant of North America is a subject worthy of the consideration of evry Christian and philanthropist in this union. That if by any practical method these Aboriginal and Primitive owners of the soil can be civillized  and incorporated into the body politic as enlightened and useful citizens no time should be lost in making the attempt.   The rapid advancing spirit of the age presents this subject before  Congress as indispensible to be acted upon now. With this subject in view and with earnest prayer to Almighty God to Enlighten your councils on this momentous subject we the under signed present the cause  of the Indians to the Earnest consideration of your Honorable Body praying that such means may be spedily adopted that will give to the Red Man a permanent home and all the Arts conveniences and com- forts of civillized life. To this End we pray that A sufficent portion of the great North Western Territory may be appropriated to this use for the reception and consentration of such of the Indian Tribes as may Be willing to become agricult- urist and recieve from the hands of the white man a sound ysystem of moral and intellectual  training. The land so appropriated to be erected into an Indian District subject to such form of  goverment and such laws as Congress may deem consistant with the constitution and laws of the United States   ENDENTRY Mr Copway remarked to W. Woodruff in personal conversation That He had long contemplated the situation of the poor Indians and he well know their position and feelings and if the United States did not soon take a different course and scease their persecutions and oppressions and driving the Indians to such extremities as they were doing that the Indians would soon rise up in their wrath  Unite together and seek revenge and strike a Blow unto death And it was in consequence of a knowledge of this fact that had inspired him to go through the United States call meetings and lecture  before the people and strive to call the attention of the white men  to use his influence to assist in staying this spirit of oppression against  the Indian. But I meet with but little success the Christians of this day manifest but little sympathy with me. I was a while with the Methodist and If I would confine myself with there doctrines they would help me but the moment that I wanted my liberty to bee free and act independantly they would forsake me but I am tired of such bigotry I am resolved to do all in my power to call upon the people and  Government that my garments may be clear in trying to ward off the blow which I know will come if the people of the United States do not scease their oppressions And when it does come I had rather not be alive than to see what will follow. But if they will not harken to my petition nor to the cry of the Indians I am as ready to die at  the cannons mouth as any whare els I will go before Congress and  talk plain before them And tell them that I want them to do sumthing with me for the Indians that we have bourn affliction and oppression from the hand of the people of the United States all the day long  and it is time it was stoped. The world have accused us of being connected with the Mormons to overthrow the Government I shall tell them it is false there has been no such combination at all but I shall tell them the Indians have treated the India white men well. And so have the Mormons thereated the Indians  well And the People of the United States And even have fed  their enemies And helped them while in distress in the willder ness. The Mormons have never given the wIandians any council to go to war with the whites or with themselves but always have coun cilled them to make peace. This principle I shall declare upon the floor of the Halls of Congress. But says this Lamanite Chief  If this Nation does not hear us, does not help us does not cease therir oppression still we have hope, for the Great SPIRIT will at  last both Hear Help and Deliver us For as A people we shall not die, for If the Lord has to raise us up help out of the Rocky Mountains  that Help will arise which will both save us and do us GOOD   rest of page blank ENDENTRY Views of Col. Thomas L. Kane on a Government for Deseret   Nov 26th 1849 In company with Dr J. M. Bernhisel I called upon Col Kane to have an interview with him In Relation to Petitioning Congress for the reception of the State of Deseret into the Union   The following is a synopsis of the conversation of Col Kane   You must not commit yourselves to any party but keep a close  mouth with all parties and the utmost discreet and wise course must  be pursued in order to do any thing at all. I will do what I can  with the free soil party. My Father and Mr Dallest with the Democ- rats. It will be the most critical Congress ever held. "I Applyed according to the wish of President Young for a Territorial Gove- rnment I had my last sad and Painful interview with Presi- dent Polk I found He did not feel disposed to favor your  People and had his men of his own stamp picked out to serve as Govornor and other officers who would have oppressed You  or injured you in any way to fill their own Pockets He would not appoint men from among yourselves. And I saw it absolutely necessary that you should have officers of your own people to govern you or you were better without any Government. I had to use my own discretion and I withdrew the Petition I am fully decided upon that point that you must have officers of yourselves, and  not military Politiscians who are struting around in your midst usurping Authority over you. It will not do for you to take the  slavery question or Antislavery or any other side but the nutral. Atchinson of Missouri with the Mormon opposing party will still be your enemies Thomas Benton has been an inveterate enemy and still may be. And all the Parties with the whole of Congress is a mass of corruption and abomination they are all governed by party manage- ment without any regard to principle and if we do any thing upon  this subject we shall have to Enter into wise Management we may have to favor the south some though they are your Enemies and I hate to do it. Parties are all breaking up And New Ones forming and no man can tel what a day will bring forth. Thomas Benton was at the Head of your being driven from  Winter Quarters the Indian Country and Polk favored it and I could not turn them from their purpose I told Mr Polk we should not present any Petition while He dictated matters. Benton is still your Enemy at heart.   Douglass is going down  with a certain class connected with him. The time was when  He could have done your People much good by merely bearing his Testimony of your good character while he was as Judge in Illinoise and He would not do it (Let this be remembered)   Col Kane remarked that from the acquaintance I have had with Mr  Bxxxxx I Apprehend entertain serious Apprehentions that He will by his course at Washington injure your cause, He was formerly A small  politition but a rough one of the Missouri Stamp and this in my view  to some extent would disqualify him for the business Besides He expressed a want of confidence in his wisdom prudence and discretion to manage this affair and that He would associate with an inferior class of men in the lower House which would also exhert a prejudi- cal effect upon our cause   ENDENTRY The following remarks were made By Col Kane to W Woodruff Dec 4th 1849   Col Kane remarked You are better without any Government from  the hands of Congress than a Territorial Goverment. The Political intreagues of Government Officers will be against you. You can govern yourselves better than they can govern you. I would prefer to see you withdraw the Bill than to have a Territorial Government  for if you are defeated in the State Government you can fall upon it again at another session if you are not a Territorial Government but if you are you cannot apply for a state Government for a number of years. I insist upon it you do not want corurupt Political men from Washington strutting around you with military epilets and dress, who will speculate out of you all they can. They will also control the Indian Agency land  Agency and will conflict with your calculation in a great measure. You do not want two Governments with you you have  a Government now which is firm and Powerful and You are under no obligations to the United States You owe them nothing but kicks cuffs and the treatment of wicked dogs for that is the ownly treatment you have recieved from their hands since you have been a People. ("And the golden rule is what measure men meet out shall be measured to them again")   Brigham Young should be your Govornor. His head is not filled with Law Books and Lawyieers tactics but he has power to see through men and things And all councillors Elders and agents abroad should be made to know their place, sustain the head man and work for the general good in all things and not act from selfish motives or to get some petty office or a little salary. He said if we you did make  up our minds to ask for a Territory we should use evry exhertion in our power to get the assureance of the President that our  choice should be granted us in a Govornor and other officers say Brigham Young for Govornor andc But if we could not get this assurance not to ask for it at all but wait the result He said If we were a state, there might be ever so many  men come along and say I am Judge, I am Col, I am Gen You can whistle and ask no odds of them. But while a Territory You cannot do it. And then their is always so many intrigues to make Political parties among you, the first thing you know A strong Political party is rising up in your midst who are selfish And against your interest.   Col Kane requested me to remember what He had said to me as He might not have health to do for us what he was now doing And He wished his views to be known to the Presidency in the valley. I remarked to him that I would do so and Pray for his success in our behalf also for his health strength  and prosperity. He thanked me and said He should Prize our prayers Highly.   I felt impressed that Col Kane was Endowed with much wisdom  in his course in our be half and I think that He had right views of things in General   rest of page blank ENDENTRY Signs of the times and remarks upon the year AD. 1849   The narrative of the year 1849 forms A remarkable chapter in the History of the world, perhaps no single year has embraced a greater number  of important events or involved so great and lasting consequences in such  a variety of relations. The overthrow of the Sikhs the esstablishment of  the British Power on the ruins of the sikh dynasty the deposition of the pope  the declaration of the Roman Republic and its early extinction by the French intervention and the struggles in sardinia, the movements of the people in Jerm- any; the contest between the Danes And Jermans; the intervention of Russia in Hungaryian affairs; the fall of Hungary; the overthrow of Venice and the movements in the national mind of France on social questions are all pregnant with vast Results Also the passing of the Bill in the British Parliament  on the 23rd of Feb granting to Jews the right to seats in the Parliament of Great Britiain is one strong omien of the redemption of that Peculiar people. These  in connexion with storms, whirlwinds, Earthquakes, fires and the most desola ting pestilence and Plagues which has swept over Europe and Eastern world shows  clearly to the reflecting mind who has any portion of the Testimony of Jesus Christ that the Great God has commenced his controversy with all Nations and that  Great Babylon is coming in Rememberance befor God. And when we turn our attention to the western Hemisphere the United States of America, any  true seer might Justly say that notwithstanding thy Nation O Land like the Antedeluvian world and Sodom and Gomorrow boast of their union strength goodness greatness and glory. Yet is here that I behold the signs of the  times big with Events, it is here that I behold the clouds thicken the Heavens gather Blackness, And the wrath of God ready to fall upon they head  For thou aret worthy. Notwithstanding O America thou art blowing aloud thy trumpet of fame and honor to all the world in sympathizing with Cossuth and other Brave Hungarians and offering a Home to the oppressed of  All nations, still thou art the man who dare commit the blackest  deeds of the Earth. It is here the God of Heaven has commenced to set  up his kingdom and offered thee the gospel of Jesus Christ to save the from the wrath of God. It is here whare that kingdom and gospel has been rejected first. It is here whare Presidents Govornors Judges and rulers of the Land with thousands of the people have broaken the  laws and Constitution of the United States and the several states by turning  mob And persecuting many of their own citizens who were the saints  of God, have deprived them of the rights of citizenship, burned their  goods and dwellings, taken some of them prisiooners held mock trials over them by a mob Jury who were their Jury by Day and guard by night who would pour whiskey down each others throats And then God Dam  God, And Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost, And evry religious sect they could  think of and close their songs twith the words God Dam the God dDam Mormons  then would imprision the saints in chains and feed them on Human  flesh, And finally murdered many of the Saints with the Phrophets  whom God hath sent unto them to call them to Repentance And when those  persecuted American cities citizens pled at the feet of the Presidents Govornors  and Judges of the Nation, they have been rejected and ridiculed while at the  same time they have in some instances been informed that there cause was  Just. And even down to the present day evry Petition presented by the  Saints of God who have been driven into the wilderness by the cruel hand  hand of oppression is rejected in evry possible way Because of these things the Lord hath said that He will arise out of his Hiding place and in his fury He will vex the Nation And in his Hot displeasure   ENDENTRY will cut off those wicked and unjust stewards and Appoint them  Portion with Hypocrites and unbelievers. One glance at the signs of  1849 in the United States will show that the Lord has commenced to fulfill his promise And He will not scease untill it is finished  There has never been A year since the esstablishment of the United States Government, when there has been so great a loss of property  and life by fire and Pestilence, or such an increase of mobs or confusion and Perplexity in the Government as in 1849. Among the most desolat- ing fires may be named the burning of Watertown on Sunday the 13th of  April $121,000 worth of property destroyed. five days after on the 18 of April  the tremendious conflagration at St Louis more than half the businesspart of the city was burned $6000000 worth of property destroyed. The  Plague also in the form of the cholera visited the same city soon after  the fire and in few weeks laid in the grave 8000 of its inhabitants the  cholera ahas also swept many thousand into the grave in various parts of  the United States. it has raged through most parts of the land during the  past season. Mobs have also increased to an alarming degree in the United  States, in Portland, they have been very consp- icuous. The desolution of the American Union also seems to be fast  ripening during the past year. the slavery question seems to be the great  hinge upon which the Nation will split At the meeting of Congress the House spent 18 days in organizing the House and Electing the speaker which cost the Goverment near $100000, And it continues to be one  of the most exciting Congresses ever met in the United States And  if the war spirit now visible in the midst of Congress continues to increase It is quite probable that the Union may be dissolved before the close of this session. Although many Editors of the public Journals have ridiculed for several years the Idea of the Dividing of the American  Union but this year thisey feel vary serious upon the subject And all the signs of the times in this government indicate that the hand writing  upon the wall is begining to be visibly seen concerning the fate of  this Nation.   When we turn our eyes towards Zion during the year 1849 we can behold the hand of the Lord also visible in her behalf. The Lord hath  promised great Blessings concerning Zion And the faithful Saints are watching  all signs appertaining to her with feelings of the deepest interest. for years past  Zion has been oppressed and as a captive removeing to and fromo but she has  finally found a resting place in the rich valleys of Ephraim in the great Bason  between the High Mountains and Everlasting Hills of North America And during  the year 1849 she has organized herself unto an Indipendant sovreign State And appointed her Governor and Nobles of themselves, so that Her Nobles are of themselves and her Govornor has proceded out of the midst of Ephraim in Zion she has prospered more than during any year since her  organization she is rapidly building up a city in peace, has good crops, universal Health, has made Arangements to lay of three New cities. Has re-organized her  marshal Legion of mighty men. 100 families have gone 200 miles South to  form A settlement under the Presidency of Bishop sand  Pitch valley. The Church during this years haves laid the foundation for  a fund called the perpetual fund the object of which is to gather  unto Zion all the poor saints who cannot gather themselves from Council Bluffs, the United States And from all the world, expect- ing it to increase yearly untill all Israel is gatherd this fund is esstablished by voluntary contributions of the Saints $5,500 was collected in the valley  in this way in one month And Bishop Edward Hunter was sent to   ENDENTRY Council Bluffs with the money to buy oxen to take up the poor from  there to the valley the coming spring. The Elders of Israel are also  determined to send the gospel to all the world as soon as possible  All of the Apostles who were in the valley have had missions  assigned them. Willard Richards  compose the first Presidency. Orson Hyde the President of the Twelve  the following are the full quorum of the present Twelve, Orson Hyde  George A. Smith, Charles C Rich Franklin D Richards. Orson  Hyde is publishing the Guardian and presiding at Council Bluffs  Parley P. Pratt is Appointed to preside over the Pacific Islands  Orson Pratt is doing a great work in England some ten or twelve thousand have been baptized under his Presidency  During 1849. Wilford Woodruff has been presiding over the  Eastern States and Canidas and has travelled over 5000 miles among the churches And is now called upon to gather the remnants to Zion George A. Smith And Ezra T. Benson has led a camp of  the saints from the Bluffs to the valley through many dangers  Amasa Lyman and Charles C Rich Are at San Francisco presiding over western Calafornia. John Taylor Lorenzo  Snow, Erastus Snow, and Franklin D. Richards, with about 20  Elders have arived in the States from the valley On mission  to England, Sweden so evry thing  is prospering in the Church and kingdom of God And All the comping of the Lord Jesus Christ   What 1850 will bring to pass time must determin but it  is certain it will be full of the Events of the times. The History  of Each year is important now Plagues, war, fire and Pestilence and  famine will lay many low in death: who will live. I am expecting to start in April to lead A company to the Bluffs and on to the valley  the dangers are many I shall have to go through, But I Pray  my Heavenly Father to protect and sustain me and those who shal  go with me that we may reach in safety. I Also pray to the Lord  to preserve and bless the Twelve And all the Elders of Israel who  go on foreign missions, And Bless the Presidency with the power  of God, and cause Zion to arise And put on her beautiful garments  I pray that the oppressions of Zion may scease that her inhabita- nts may have power to build Houses and inhabit them plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. I Pray that her landing may be like the Garden of the Lord that she may have the early and latter rain that the Land may bring forth ofin her stregngth. O, Lord order our cause aright which is before the Congress of  this Nation may all things work together for the good of thisy  saints, preserve us all from Evil of evry kind and help us to do thy will in all things on the Earth. O Lord Hasten the gathering of  Israel, who are cast out And the dispersed of Judagh may the Lamanites soon blossom like the rose, May the Zion of God who has risen and gone up into the mountains be clothed upon with wrighteousness and the power of God. May the Church become prepared like a  bride prepared for the coming of the Bridegroom And myay they People not ownly have cause to rejoice in the Holy One of Israel  during the AD 1850 But through all time And All Eternity   ENDENTRY I Travelled through Eleven of the  United States and New Brunswick  Prince Edwards Island  During the year 1849 Total distance Travelled 5040 Miles   I held public meetings 92 Meetings   I Baptized 11 Persons   I Confirmed 21 Persons   I Ordained Ezra Carter my Father in Law 1 Patriarch   Elders 4 Elders   High Priest 1 High Priest   Blest 11 Children   Administered unto sick persons 47 Persons   I Wrote 202 Letters   I Received 156 Letters   ENDENTRY WILFORD WOODRUFFS JOURNAL FOR 1850   ENDENTRY January 1, 1850 ~ Tuesday   Jan 1st 1850 FIGURE I recieved A letter from O Hyde containing power  of Attorney to collect $580.08 of Mr Oliver Carter No 4 Garland street Boston I spent part of the Day Journal writing    ENDENTRY January 2, 1850 ~ Wednesday   2nd I went into Carter bought some things    ENDENTRY January 3, 1850 ~ Thursday   3rd In company with my son Bradford in cars and sleigh and spent the night with Br Samuel Hardy distance 40    ENDENTRY January 4, 1850 ~ Friday   4th In company with three Brother Hardy's I went fishing on Rock pond and caught 20 lbs of Pickerell through the Ice    ENDENTRY January 5, 1850 ~ Saturday   5th We fished some on three ponds to day and cought 18 pickerell    ENDENTRY January 6, 1850 ~ Sunday   6th Sunday I preached to the Saints in Bradford had a good time took tea with Br G J Hardy    ENDENTRY January 7, 1850 ~ Monday   7th FIGURE I returned home by cars and recieved 3 letters from Wooly  N H Felt, And A letter and an Epistle from the presidency in Zion All of which were full of good News. The following is a portion of the contents or substance of it "They have universal health good crops plenty to eat No sickness or Death of late are Prospering on evry hand are laying off three new cities one at Sandpitch valley 200 miles south of salt Lake valley from 50 to 100 families had gone to form  a settlement at Sand Pittoh valley under the Presidency of Father Morley they had organized the Nauvoo Legion in the valley and it would have been a source of Joy to the Saints throughout the Earth could they have witnessed its movements on the day of its great parade to see a whole Army of mighty men in martial aray ground their Arms not by command but simply by request repair to the temple block and with pick and spade open the foundation for a place of worship and treat the pilasters beams and roof so that we now have a commodious edifice 100 by 60 feet with brick walls whare we assemble with the Saints from sabbath to sabbath and almost evry evening in the  week to teach, council and defise devise ways and means for the prosperity of the Kingdom of God, and we feel thankful that we have a better house  or bowery for Public worship the coming winter than we have heretofore had any winter in this dispensation. Also the walls of the Council House are nearly completed. The baths at the warm spring house are in Progress and the foundation is laid and the brick prepaired for an extensive store house and granary and no exheertions are wanting on our part  to push forward the Public works as fast as tithing and means are put into our hand. They spoke of their great celebration on the 24th July as being a day long to be remembered. 15 brethren had arived from the gold country some had plenty of gold some were as destitute as when they went on board of the ship Brooklin. "The true use of gold was for paving streets  covering houses and makeing culinary dishes and when the saints shall have preached the gospel raised grain and built up cities enough the Lord will open up the way for a supply of gold to the perfect satisfaction of his people. They hadve laid the foundation for a perpetual fund for the purpose of gathering all the poor saints to Zion who cannot gather them selves untill all the poor ar gatherd from Council Bluffs, the United States and all the World And $5,500 isas the first fruits of it is sent to Hunter to buy oxen to take the  poor with him to Zion this season and then Each year to return to the   ENDENTRY states with all the money of the perpetual fund to continue to gather the poor so that when A nation is born in a day they can be removed  the next of necessary. Therey are also resolved to send the gospel to all the world as soon as Possible. All of the Twelve Apostles who are in the valley with many others have their mission assigned them to the Nations. Elder Curtis E Bolton and Joseph Toronto  with him. Franklin D. Richards goes to George B  Wallace, Joseph W Young and Jacob Gates will all go on a mission to cooperate with President  Sweeden Elder P. P. Pratt will go on a western Mission to the Islands in the spring. The above named Elders except P P Pratt have Just arived  in the States. The Epistle also makes the following remarks Elder Orson  Pratt is Doing a great work in England and the cause of truth is ad- vanceing rapidly in all her home dominions and the rejoiceing of the Saints causes satan to howl for he is compelled to be subject to the power of  the highest. "Elder Woodruff is located at Cambridgeport Mass and has been comforting and instructing the saints in Caniala and the Eastern States the Past year. If Elder Woodruff will gather  up all the saints in his vicinity and come with them to this place He  will be doing a great work and will be opening a way for a visit to those Nations who have both eyes and ears and are crying to the Elders of Israel come tell ofus of the things of God for we have heard that God is with you." They call loudly upon me to gather up all the saints in the Eastern Country and bring them to Zion to Esstablish Woollen and Cotton factories and Iron founderies they say there is Iron and coal in good locations not far distant.
