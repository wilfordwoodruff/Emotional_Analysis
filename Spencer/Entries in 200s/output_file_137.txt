Yet I will touch upon a few prominent items  which I consider important to the subject in which I feel deeply interested  There are certain events which stand forth in bold relief of deep  interest in the history of evry nation under heaven. Therefore the History of the Indians or there present condition has also a deep interest  an interest of greater importance than at first presents itself to the mind of the American People Although it may appear to them as coverd with  A cloud or buried deep from their view yet it none the less exhists.    brethren the Red men for years and I have resolved to call aloud upon the  white men of this Nation to give ear to my Petitons. If you do not see the Indian Orator in your midst making a displ white man it is not because he has not talent but because he has not a chance to exercise it    this Government that they may assist me in concentrating the Indians  together that they may live &amp; not die I want Congress to grant them  a portion of Territory that they can call their own and be concentrated upon it that they not be driven from it any more. They once were  the owners &amp; occupiers of the whole soil of all North America. The white man came &amp; removed the Indians and continually driven them  untill they can see no hope but the grave before them. I now ask in their behalf a Territory to settle them upon that they may have a permanent  home forever And come under the United States Government  let them have some form of Government &amp; become part and  parcel of the United States. In this matter I have studied the interest of all both the white &amp; red men    the children can point to the graves of their fathers &amp; say we can  now live in Peace and be driven no more. We can visit the graves of  our fathers with none to drive us from them and they will be inspired  to engage in evry laudable undertaking that now marks the course of the white man    that will be of benefit to them, they would obtain knowledge and  would make a good use of it. The gospel could then be introduced  among them and they would be far more ready to recieve it when they find the white man is consistant &amp; willing to do them  good, but when the white man offers the gospel to the Indian one year &amp; the next comes  of his Fathers He has no faith or confidence in either the white man or his gospel    among them and they will recieve it for they would then see of necessity they must cultivate the land or die they could not depend upon  game for support and they would turn their attention to cultivating  the soil make improvements and take delight in the same  man    deliverd from the Ill consequences of constant removing which has continually   ENDENTRY  have been multiplied &amp; vary great. This has been one main reason  why schools have been unproductive of good among them. This is  also  The Indians are fast decreasing and Passing away what is the cause of all this. There are various causes Their constant remov- ing is one cause. Disease which has been introduced among them  By white men in the capacity of traders, missionaries, and Emigrants  Also the introduction of Alc away. Also wars among themselves &amp; wars with white men all of  which have continually wasted away the Indan tribes    the conducting of those wars and in the treaties of peace made And  broaken the Indians have been badly treated and abused by the whites. For instance some ruffian or trader visites the Indians introduces wild fire or Alcohol among them &amp; will get the Indians drunk &amp; pehaps drunk himself and will cheat them in any way  he can And perhaps kill some of them and in his career he gets  killed himself, then the cry goes forth that the savage Indians are killings &amp; murdering the inhabitants of the country. it is proclaim- ed in all the public Journals of the Union. Yes one side of the  story is proclaimed as with peals of thunder throughout the Earth  But  is not told the world hear it not they do not enquire or ask for it. But as soon as the story of the white man is told &amp; proclaimed to the world, the armies of war must be prepared &amp; soldiers sent forth to drive and Kill the Indians and burn their home  and in this way the most desolating and expensive wars have been  carried on for many years untill we feel it is time for the white man to take a different course with the Indians.    Indians I would refer you to the Cherokee Nation. That people were fast impr man had extensive farms &amp; good dwellings and continu rapidly advancing in improvements untill they were suddenly  brought to a stand in theire course by being cruelly called upon  by the state of Georgia to give up their lands and go away from the graves of their fathers into the wilderness and thus it was that  the mighty nation instead of recieving that support encouragement &amp; comfort from the Nation that He ought to recieve was forced By  the cruel hand of oppression to bow their heads in sorrow and dispair as they wend their way to their so called home in the  wilderness whare they can find no other hope ownly to pass a few  more years in sorrow untill they shall be called to pass through the  same ordeal again to remove and remove untill they are anhilated  from off the face of the Earth. O Ye white man what incour- agement do you give the Indian to plant, to build, to learn, to  cultivate the Earth, or to recieve a Religion that professes love  mercy kindness and truth while those who profess to Enjoy it  deals out such deeds of oppression &amp; cruelty upon the heads of the red men that it drives them to madness and Despair. Let the  American Nation stay their hand from this time forth in their oppression &amp; drivings of the Indians lest they drive them beyound a point which  the Indian will endure and return a Blow upon the head of the  white man which will fill many a habitation with death. Once give the Indians A Territory A home whare they can have a full assurance   ENDENTRY  saluted with a call to remove from their lands then if they do not show forth a spirit of improvement then cast them  off as not worthy of your support or attention but untill then you are not justifyed yur garments are not clear    immediate action upon th    their lands. Emigration of the white men are already surround- ing them &amp; in their midst and the richness &amp; fertility of the  Indians lands are a temptation to the white man and invite  him to settle thereon.    more than what they need to till and cultivate for their support  Let there be a Territory set off on the North west of Ioway North  of Missouri on which there is now no white settlement And let the Indians East of the Rocky moun- tains And in the United States be gatherd upon it. Then let other Territories in the west be appropriated And let all the Indians on the North American Continant be collected together &amp; learned to cultivate the Earth. They will soon associate themselves  together, and cease their wors among themselves also with the white man. If there is not sumthing of this kind done the vast Emigration through all the Indians lands will soon  destroy the game &amp; then want &amp; starvation will ensue &amp; this  will bring on war between the white &amp; Red men.    And they will carry it out it will be of vast benefit both to  the Indians And the people of the United States    home, whare schools can be esstablished among them and  their children taught the English language. Farms can also be  opened among them and when they see they have a permanent  home for themselves and their children and they have no game  to depend upon for food they will immediately go to work &amp; cultivate  the Earth like white men. The gospel can then be introduced among them to a good Effect and they will recieve it with  Thankfulness when they can be made to believe that then the hand that deals out the gospel to them is not laying a plan  to take the advantage of them and preparing a way to drive them from their home &amp; country. It will also unite not ownly their  interest &amp; attachment towards each other but their regard &amp; interest  with that of the United States       is costing the Government immens sums of money     there has already been  ment    expens to Government could then be dispensed with     tribes with the Intention of keeping the Indians in subjection  these would not be needed of if the Indians were in a Territory of their own for by having their trail clear &amp; no encroachments of the white man upon their borders there would be no cause of war or fortifications.   ENDENTRY  before the Congress of the United States and urged them  to grant my Prayer for the benefit of both the white and Red men. I want your aid, I want you to sign my petition that the voice of thousands may be  behalf of this peti Governors and American citizens in General that my prayer  may be heard &amp; answerd. Give the North American Indians A home, a place whare the soles of their feet can rest in peace then you will do your duty towards them, &amp; place them in a situations whare you can teach them Literature, Agriculture, &amp; Commerce, give them the chance the white man has, And I Prophesy in the name of the Lord that there will ere long be found among them their Philosophers, Franklins, &amp; Washing- tons, who would do honor to any civillized or Christian Nation on the globe. But let this Nation turn a deaf ear to my Petitions and the Petitions of the Indians, continue  to oppress them and drive them to desperation, and the   hill. The war  Mountains to the other. The Indian will then sell his life  as dear as possible and deal out  offers. When this blow is struk It will be Terrible to all May God forbid that  scenes of Bloody Brook should any more be enacted.    before you, That I now call upon this Nation bearing a petition unto them, will you hear my Prayer, will you give the  Indian his rights, will you help bury the hate hat forever Or will you make a grave to bury your dead I leave you to DECIDE        The memorial of the undersigned citizens and Residence of the United  States Most Respectfully showeth That the present state of the Indian Tribes within the jurisdiction of the United States and the continant of North America is a subject worthy of the consideration of evry Christian and philanthropist in this union. That if by any practical method these Aboriginal and Primitive owners of the soil can be civillized  and incorporated into the body politic as enlightened and useful citizens no time should be lost in making the attempt.

With this subject in view and with earnest prayer to Almighty God to Enlighten your councils on this momentous subject we the under signed present the cause  of the  praying that such means may be spedily adopted that will give to the Red Man a permanent home and all the Arts conveniences and com- forts of civillized life. To this End we pray that A sufficent portion of the great North Western Territory may be appropriated to this use for the reception &amp; consentration of such of the Indian Tribes as may Be willing to become agricult- urist and recieve from the hands of the white man a sound  training. The land so appropriated to be erected into an Indian District subject to such form of  goverment &amp; such laws as Congress may deem consistant with the constitution &amp; laws of the United States   ENDENTRY  That He had long contemplated the situation of the poor Indians and he well know their position and feelings and if the United States did not soon take a different course and scease their persecutions and oppressions and driving the Indians to such extremities as they were doing that the Indians would soon rise up in their wrath  Unite together and seek revenge and strike a Blow unto death And it was in consequence of a knowledge of this fact that had inspired him to go through the United States call meetings and lecture  before the people and strive to call the attention of the white men  to use his influence to assist in staying this spirit of oppression against  the Indian. But I meet with but little success the Christians of this day manifest but little sympathy with me. I was a while with the Methodist and If I would confine myself with there doctrines they would help me but the moment that I wanted my liberty to be and act independantly they would forsake me but I am tired of such bigotry I am resolved to do all in my power to call upon the people and  Government that my garments may be clear in trying to ward off the blow which I know will come if the people of the United States do not scease their oppressions And when it does come I had rather not be alive than to see what will follow. But if they will not harken to my petition nor to the cry of the Indians I am as ready to die at  the cannons mouth as any whare els I will go before Congress and  talk plain before them And tell them that I want them to do sumthing with me for the Indians that we have bourn affliction &amp; oppression from the hand of the people of the United States all the day long  and it is time it was stoped. The world have accused us of being connected with the Mormons to overthrow the Government I shall tell them it is false there has been no such combination at all but I shall tell them the Indians have treated the  men well. And so have the Mormons t well And the People of the United States And even have fed  their enemies And helped them while in distress in the wil ness. The Mormons have never given the  to go to war with the whites or with themselves but always have coun cilled them to make peace. This principle I shall declare upon the floor of the Halls of Congress. But says this Lamanite Chief  If this Nation does not hear us, does not help us does not cease the oppression still we have hope, for the Great SPIRIT will at  last both  die, for If the Lord has to raise us up help out of the Rocky Mountains  that Help will arise which will both save us and do us    rest of page blank ENDENTRY     Col Kane to have an interview with him In Relation to Petitioning Congress for the reception of the State of Deseret into the Union       mouth with all parties and the utmost discreet and wise course must  be pursued in order to do any thing at all.

One glance at the signs of  1849 in the United States will show that the Lord has commenced to fulfill his promise And He will not scease untill it is finished  There has never been A year since the esstablishment of the United States Government, when there has been so great a loss of property  &amp; life by fire &amp; Pestilence, or such an increase of mobs or confusion and Perplexity in the Government as in 1849. Among the most desolat- ing fires may be named the burning of Watertown on Sunday the 13 April $121,000 worth of property destroyed. five days after on the 18 of April  the tremendious conflagration at St Louis more than half the businesspart of the city was burned $6000000 worth of property destroyed. The  Plague also in the form of the cholera visited the same city soon after  the fire and in few weeks laid in the grave  cholera  the United States. it has raged through most parts of the land during the  past season. Mobs have also increased to an alarming degree in the United  States, in Portland, they have been very consp- icuous. The desolution of the American Union also seems to be fast  ripening during the past year. the slavery question seems to be the great  hinge upon which the Nation will split At the meeting of Congress the House spent 18 days in organizing the House &amp; Electing the speaker which cost the Goverment near $100000, And it continues to be one  of the most exciting Congresses ever met in the United States And  if the war spirit now visible in the midst of Congress continues to increase It is quite probable that the Union may be dissolved before the close of this session. Although many Editors of the public Journals have ridiculed for several years the Idea of the Dividing of the American  Union but this year th signs of the times in this government indicate that the hand writing  upon the wall is begining to be visibly seen concerning the fate of  this Nation.    behold the hand of the Lord also visible in her behalf. The Lord hath  promised great Blessings concerning Zion And the faithful Saints are watching  all signs appertaining to her with feelings of the deepest interest. for years past  Zion has been oppressed and as a captive removeing to and fr finally found a resting place in the rich valleys of Ephraim in the great Bason  between the High Mountains &amp; Everlasting Hills of North America And during  the year 1849 she has organized herself unto an Indipendant sovreign State And appointed her Governor &amp; Nobles of themselves, so that Her Nobles are of themselves &amp; her Govornor has proceded out of the midst of Ephraim in Zion she has prospered more than during any year since her  organization she is rapidly building up a city in peace, has good crops, universal Health, has made Arangements to lay of three New cities.

They spoke of their great celebration on the 24 long to be remembered. 15 brethren had arived from the gold country some had plenty of gold some were as destitute as when they went on board of the ship Brooklin. "The true use of gold was for paving streets  covering houses &amp; makeing culinary dishes &amp; when the saints shall have preached the gospel raised grain &amp; built up cities enough the Lord will open up the way for a supply of gold to the perfect satisfaction of his people.

The Epistle also makes the following remarks Elder Orson  Pratt is Doing a great work in England &amp; the cause of truth is ad- vanceing rapidly in all her home dominions &amp; the rejoiceing of the Saints causes satan to howl for he is compelled to be subject to the power of  the highest. "Elder Woodruff is located at Cambridgeport Mass and has been comforting and instructing the saints in Caniala and the Eastern States the Past year. If Elder Woodruff will gather  up all the saints in his vicinity and come with them to this place He  will be doing a great work and will be opening a way for a visit to those Nations who have both eyes and ears and are crying to the Elders of Israel come tell  you." They call loudly upon me to gather up all the saints in the Eastern Country &amp; bring them to Zion to Esstablish Woollen &amp; Cotton factories &amp; Iron founderies they say there is Iron &amp; coal in good locations not far distant.
