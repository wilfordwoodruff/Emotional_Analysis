I secured my citizen papers yesterday, and think that in abut 2 weeks the pass- board will be here. The reason why I wish to start before April is, because my brother ENDENTRY in law from Switzerland came on visit, and his business calls him home for the latter part of March, so I wish to travel with him. But if it is not according to your counsel I wish to stay untill the time set for me to go. Hoping that you will tell me when I should be in the city for further instruction  I remain yours humble servant Joseph Keller Logan Utah.  Let him go as soon as he gets his papers. J. F. S.

Woodruff  Dear Bro  I think it proper for me to  represent to you that Elder Oliver ^(or Olavas)^ Jacobsen of Randolph who has been called on a mission to  Scandinavia is the Bishop's Counsellor, and a very active useful man whom we cannot spare without  detriment to the welfare of the Ward. Woodruff is an outside place with a mixed population and re- quires all the care the Authorities can give it. Also the Co op Store of the Town has been badly managed, but is now under the direction of Bro Jacobsen who has the confidence of the people and I understand of the Z. C. M. I. who would I think probably close out the Store if Bro Jacobsen (whom they know) goes off and such action would cause much dissatis- faction.
