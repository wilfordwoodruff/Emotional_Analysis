 When in the course of human events have we ever witnessed a more interesting society of mortals than is here presented to our view it is the glorious motives that caused the assembly of those patriots that endowed its scene with such interest here before us is the portrait of our fore fathers and with the thoughts of tyranny & oppresssion chilled the blood in their veins & rights & liberty ocipyied a seat in their hearts & vibrated their assembly so powerfully that that they all of one heart & one mind like a band of brothers with an eager hand stretched grasp'd their pen & enrolled their names on a list which at this [maybe the] same time they were not insensible that if they they should be defeated they were signing their death warrant but this company of men were not destitute of deep forethought & sensibility they were men that highly prized the privileges liberty & happiness of America & their [maybe these or those or perhaps they're] ancestors with one accord trusting to the protecttion of Allmighty God pledged their fortunes liberties & lives to maintain the liberties which we now enjoy & by the help of God they suceed[e]d in their understanding & to the astonishment of the world accomplished the emancipation of America this company of enterprising men accomplished some of the greatest deedes that ever was recorded considering what they had to encounter inexperiance had to contend with dissapline [discipline] poverty [two words unintelligible] loss of charters one abridgement of liberty after another still indulging the feelings & adopting the languag of Affection untill [unintelligible word]  & religion bid them rise & they did and arise and secure to America those rights & privledges which the God of nature designed for all his rational offsprings but whare now are those noble men that turned the wheels of American independance we hope & trust their names are enrolled on that golden list of everlasting life & their immortal spirits in that society whare glory will never tarnish but will grow brighter & brighter long after after the spheers of nature stand still.	by a well wisher to liberty & freedom 
 while meditating uppon the glorious deeds performed by our forefathers we do not pretend to advance the argument that they were performed without the assistance of higher power. [illegible] as the amancipation of America has been accomplished no one of decided virtue will but admit that it was perfected by the hand of of a over ruling Providence who of us can [illegible] the imaginary idea but that the small monster[?] of europeans would not have been crushed by the wanton savages or driven like chaff before the wind by the disciplined armies that were conscripted to this continent for the sole purpose of subduing of the univers therefore let us live with a realizing sens of the privledges & blessings which we share & while we are partaking of these gifts may our harts be raised in thanksgiving to God that he has seen fit to give us a birth in such an enlightened part of the globe & may our time be so spent & our talents so improved that whare [or when] [two illegible words] done with life & sense & mortal puts on immortality that we may have a happy entrance in to courts of that being who ocupies a more elevated station than mankind    [written vertically in right margin] Willford 1831   [eleven similar flourishes, one in left margin and ten on bottom of the page]   
 My dear Brother,    I have but little spare time.  But I will appropriate these first few moments  which I have been able ^to^ catch from my num-  erous calls—to answer your very interesting  questions? Let me say to you I am glad you  took the liberty to propose them. I shall al-  ways be ready to listen to any similar re-  quests. But I hasten to my bussiness.    Your first question respects the Sabbath  & its change.    God having finished his work of Creation in six  days, ceased or rested therefrom on the seventh,  & set it apart for the more solemn worship of him  self by men, & as an emblem & pledge of their eternal  blessedness. ##Genesis 2:1-2|Gen II 1.2.##    The ancient Patriarchs observed the Sabbath, though  we have no particular account of it.    The "End of days," when Cain & Abel offered their  oblations, & The day when the sons of God met together  in Job's time, doubtless were Sabbath days. ##Genesis 4:3-7|Gen. IV.## ##Job 1:6|Job I.6##  & ##Job 2:1|II.1.##    When Gods ancient people were fed with manna from   Heaven, in the wilderness, they were told that a double  portion would fall on the day previous to the Sabbath  which should be gathered & that none should be gathered  on the sabbath for the Sabbath was the LORDs. ##Exodus 16:23|Exodus. 16.23## 
 Lines on the death  of an Infant    How short is life! Tis but a transient glow,  That's often dim'd by sublunary woe:—  So short is life— So feeble is its beam,  It scarcely glimmers ere its end is seen!    We've seen the Aged 'neath a weight of years,  Resign their breath, and leave this vale of tears—  We've seen amidst their glory and their prime,  Dear friends, remov'd from all the scenes of time—  We've seen the Youth both beautiful and gay,  By sickness seiz'd, and borne by death away  We've seen sweet Babes their tender eyelids close,  Forget to weep—and sink in still repose:  Cecilia too,— Dear Babe!— Her journey's o'er!  She breath'd—she wept;— but she shall weep no more.    How short her time by providence assign'd!  But fourteen days she was on earth confin'd !  Angelic bands her spirit did convey,  To happier realms in everlasting day:  Though latest born, she's first ariv'd at home,  To see the splendor of the eternal throne.    Like some fair plant to chilling winds expos'd,  (Before the tender bud its leaves disclos'd)  Which pluck'd by gentle hands, was borne away,  To some fair clime to bloom in bright array, 
 Thus it appears that the Sabbath was most sacredly re-  garded, before the moral law was given from Sinai.  But to mark the perpetual & universal obligations  of the observance of the Sabbath, God proclaimed the  law of it from Sinais wrote it in a table of stone,  a long with the rest which are allowed to be moral,  ##Exodus 20:8-11|Exodus XX 8-11##. Injunctions to keep it & threatenings for  the breach of it, are every where found in the law &   the prophets.    The Sabbath is therefore of universal obligation—  How is it changed from the seventh to the first day  of the week?    In answering this question I would observe  I. Man's moral obligation respects the seventh part  of his time, rather than any particular day.   It is not certain that the Godly before the flood, kept  the same day which they kept after that event.    Now it is certain that the same cronology was obser-  ved at the giving of the law at Sinia, which had  been observed before & after the flood.    But however cronology might alter, a seventh-  part of the time would be the same in all ages.    II To honour his own ressurrection, Jesus the LORD  of the Sabbath, changed the Sabbath from the  seventh to the First day of the week.    To mark the devine authority of this change,  he on that day, made repeated visits to his de-  ciples—##John 20:19-26|John XX. 19.26##. On that day he bestowed the mirac  ulous gifts & graces of the Holy Ghost. ##Acts 2|Acts II.1##. 
 The past    to the reflecting mind nothing is at once more instructive and interesting than a review  of the past. Who is this that has looked back on ages that are past and traced  empires and republicks through the various stages of their prosperity and decline, that  has trod amid the mouldering ruins of cities which were once grand and magnificent  that has reposed within the walls of palaces which were once the sects of luxury and festivity  but now deserted and forsaken but has turned his thoughts within uppon himself and been  convinced of his own insignificance and the mutability of all that is human  in the course of nature nations have arisen flourished and fallen the monuments  of kings the triumphal arches of conquerors and heroes have crumbled. Time in his  ravages has been as unyielding as Death and as insatiable as the grave in his rapid  flight he has dashed in ruins the strongest on the most beautiful fabricks that human  ingenuity could devise or human art construct he has but glanced at the  pride the pomp the pageantry of man & they have faded in oblivion. Man being  mortal himself how can he expect to confer immortality on his works  himself the vain & transitory being of a moment how can he expect that  stability to will be inherent in his actions. It is true he can clime the steep  and rugged hill of fame and uppon its towering summit light the fire of  his renown which will for ages burn a beacon to the univers he can  wear some stupendous fabrick & theire inscribe his name which will for centuries  stand a momento of his greatness but he cannot protect his trophies for on  the destroying hand of time or for a moment notand the all powerful arm  of death Time sweeps by with resistless force and man & his works are  borne away on his troubled waves to the shoreless ocean of eternity.    In this light how dimly shines the pomp and pagentry of earth, how  useless & unavailing the contentions of the great & powerful ware man  to review the past with calmness & reflection & imprint the truths  it unfolds uppon the mind convinced of the futility of all  sublemary things he would rase his thoughts from the xpanding  things of earth & place them on a brighter & better world  Full of the hopes of heaven avarice would unlock her hoarded gold  & extend his hand to brighteyed clarity. Ambition leaving his idolized  dreams would cease to deluge countries with the blood of his fellow beings  & study to alleviate their sufferings, luxury forsaking his revels & his  banquets would shed the tear of pity over the woes & miseries of the hungry  & destitute & in fine the primeval scenes of felicity would again be restored  & man would again be repose beneath the blissful shades of the  trees of Paradise    [sideways text] Willford 1832 [end of sideways text] 
 O thou immortal mind, saint to myself man in  This rapid flight from infancy to the tomb.

And there he searches in  Vain untill a voice sounds in his ear Ye Son of earth  Why will ye longer search below for that which invitingly  Calls thee from above the voice awakes him from his sleep  He hears the voice And lifts up his eyes with asstonishment  While wrapped with wonder that he has no long refused eternal  Life which has long been offered him by the greatest  Senator of heaven which is the Son of God Now he  Is awake to his guilt he feels he has to long refused  The calls of that kind heavenly friend But he now yields  To the calls and upon his mercy relies And what is the vault  Now he has a friend above all earthly, he has now happiness  Which satisfies a boundless and immortal mind Now  He has new views new aims His feet now is placed  In that strait & narrow path to Life eternal And while  persuing the path alone he feels it is not good to be  Alone, Then he raises a petition to his God to grant  Him some friend to assist him on his progress  But hark the rolling of wheels sounds in his ear  He lifts up his eyes and views a Charriot enters his  path and stops to awate his arival. He approaches it  With a slow but undaunted step Soon he stands by  Its side whare he views the name of friendship marked on  Its front in Capitals of light. the name he loves He  Is drawn still nearer by the occupient of the charriot  Of friendship, who sits in a female form By her  Side he requests a seat he is held awhile in deep suspens  By her silence But soon she vary reservedly bows  Her dignity and grants him his requests He seats  Himself amid the curtains of reserve and distance  Which in their proper colors shine. And soon its Charriot  Begins to advance although slow yet with apparent  Safty While the rain is tortly held he enters a field  Whare new scenes open to his view distance gives  Way reserve mooves back to make room for the  Curtains of confidence to appear to line the charriot  Of friendship Now they shine with more brilliant  Colors than the rays of the noon day's sun Now  Happiness beams on evry side And amid these delights  The flint of affection strikes fire which reaches his  Heart with deep vibrations which blows his soul into  A wide expansion to create room for one still more  Expanded to enter with a chain of feeling unfelt before  Amid these delights which language cannot paint the  Delicate finger of anticipation silently points him to  Yonder field of happiness Whose flowers are untarnished  Virtue.

 Among the great events of man  Amasa was erected to be active in the plan  Of bringing to pass Immortal things both heavenly & divine  Which are presenting themselves upon the wings of time    The hills of New hampshire have oft his footsteps bourn  Many of his youthful days to post amid the fields of corn  As the law to Adam hath not been repealed  It is yet virtuous for man to labour in the field    In all ages the Lord hath chosen whom he would  To bring to pass the great events of God  David left his flocks to meet an unce^i^rcunsised foe  Amasa now is call to warn this generation to    As light out of darkness and truth out of the earth hath sprung  And given access to a covenant God made with man  At nineteen years of age Amasa did this covenant secure  And now his voice to this lofty motive is believed    He is engaged in a great and glorious cause  Which is teaching God's great and Celestial laws  While millions will not raise their hands  To gain an inheritants on Joseph's land    A dispensation of the gospel is commited unto him  That he may warn this generation to flee from sin  By the [laws ]of Joseph the people will be made one  And be prepared for the Revelation of God's own son    Amasa hath left his kindred and home  To preach the same gospel that did Moses Lehi & John  And if faithful he will arise in clouds above   And be crowned with King Jesus in an element of love    He fears not the ep threats or epethets of man  While he is a coworker with Joseph in bringing fourth the plan  Of gathering all Israel upon the promised land  Abraham's seed will then be numerous as the sand    When Amasa herd the fulness of the gospel sound  He opened his heart The seed took root on mellow ground  And then by faith he launched forth  With Zerubbabel to proclaim its worth    After spending eighteen months in a glorious cause  And faithfully warning the gentiles to keep Gods holy laws  He is called of God to be a high priest  And to journey with his brethren to the far west    In eighteen hundred thirty four on the firstfifth day of May  Amasa joined his Brethren on that illustriois day  And with them did journey to Missouri's land  To protect his Brethren which were on afflicted land    In this worthy deed his faith hath been prooved & tryed  And his offering compared by Abrahams side  This mission now is over with him  The people of the south will hear his voice & flee from sin    Tis true that in the summer of eighteen hundred, 34  That Amasa was afflicted very sore  Yet in the same year on Missouri's banks he did stand  With Willford and [received] the promised land    On the twenty third of December—he is prepared to go forth  To preach the gospel to the people of the south  Haman his pardner Milton and Joseph to  Will proclaim the gospel as other Apostles do    Dear Brethren in the Lord I say go on  Adorn your high standing before the Father & the Son  They are privleged above most who have a birth  In this generation or now supply a place on earth    May God grant you grace while you travel  That you may over-come the powers of the devil  May not the force of Earth or hell combined  Destroy the peace of your expanded mind    Let a zeal for Gods law vibrate your soul  While you teach the fruits of a Kingdom begining to roll  Spare not.

 [page torn] she, thrice happy Babe By hands Divine,  Was rais'd to bloom in a more healthful clime,  Where sin does ne'er appear, nor grief, nor pain;  But peace and joy uninterupted reign:  Remote from ills, secure from earthly woe,  Where chilling blasts are never to blow.    Cecilia! Lovely Babe!— Her infant frame  No more shall feel the smart of mortal pain.  She only sleeps!— Tho' motionless she lies,  Her sacred dust, refin'd, again shall rise,  To shine in bliss most exquistitely bright,   Surpassing far the sun's refulgent light.    And is she dead? O no! She enter'd life  The moment she escape'd this world of strife:  For here by tegious tedious flight the mind aspires,  And thro' the sense all its skill acquires;  And waits imprison'd, till by slow degrees,  The organs strengthen, and the spirit sees,  Or feels (by means of sense) the things around,  Or harks, delighted, to the pleasing sound.  But now from earth remov'd, her soul expands,  And by the throne in holy rapture stands;  Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streams,  And basks delighted, in unsully'd beams;  Now hears with wonder the melodious strain,  And joins to celebrate Messiah's name;  Her mind illumin'd, now with glad surprise,  Sees happier worlds, unseen by mortal eyes. 
 III. This is called the LORDs day.    The Psalmist in refference to the day on which Christ  arose & to the whole day of the Gospel dispensation—  says, This is the day which the LORD hath made  let us rejoice & be glad therein.    John the Revelater calls the first day the LORDs  day. ##Revelation 1:10|Rev. 1–10##.    IV The primitive christians met for public wor-  ship & made their collections for the poor on  the first day of the week. ##Acts 20:7|Acts 20.7##. ##1 Corinthians|Cor. 16##.    They also met on the evening of the first day  of the ^week^ & their devine LORD repeatedly met  with them.    I close these remarks by observing—That there  is an alarming laxness among christian pro-  fessors in keeping the christian Sabbath. O that  we might all awake to righteousness, on this  subject.    In answer to your second question of^n^ the  subject of miracles—I answer in general.    I. Miracles were wrought for a definite  purpose—in the apostolic age—summari  ly to establish the devine authenticity  of the holy religion of the blessed Jesus.  That object has been accomplished. The evi-  dence arising from miracles alone, is clear—

 Tho' while on earth, unnotic'd by her mind  Were all the splendid scenes of human kind,  She now perhaps from Sion's height sublime,  Looks down and views the simple things of time;  Or, if permitted, to the earth descends,  And gladly mingles with her earthly friends:  Altho' unseen, her happy spirit near,  May hear the sigh, and see the falling tear,  May with concern behold maternal grief,  And fondly wish to soothe and give relief.    Sigh not surviving friends—let sorrow cease—  She now inherits everlasting peace  Tho' now you grieve, your grief shall turn to joy,  And loftiest praise shall all your pow'rs employ:  For when with you all earthly things are o'er,  Beyond old Jordan's flood, on Caanan's shore,  Your lovely Babe, with rapture fill'd shall stand,  And shout your welcome to the promis'd land!

 convincing & overwhelming.    II If we should exercise strong faith in God, and  live at the fountain head of holy influence  that is—should we watch unto prayer, and  pray without ceasing—should we daily fear  to sin & daily deny ourselves & take up our  cross & follow christ—should all professors  of religion persue this course—doubtless a  wonderfull change would be effected at  once in the state of the church, but even  in that case I do not see that the church  would have any authority to attempt  to perform such miracles, as were performed  in the apostolic age.    They doubtless would shed their holy  influence all around & be instrumen-  tal in the conversion of thousands of souls,  & the glorious Gospel would be spedily  be preached to all who dwell upon the  earth. For christians would feel that  all they possessed is christ's & they would  most cheerfully devote themselves their  time, talents, property privileges,  spirits, souls & bodyies—with their present  all & all they ever expected—to the  service of their dear LORD & master.  Let us pray fervently my dear brother, that 
 The LORD would hasten this glorious state of  the church.    Then will the deciples of Jesus be instrumen-  tal in performing as great or greater miracles  than did the apostles.    As it respects your—    III. Question. I would observe that it  is in my view, always desirable that those  who are baptized should join a church, an  evangelical church—But I am ready to—  baptize all persons who apply to me to  administer that ordinance—provided they  give evidence of evangelical piety.    That the blessed saviour would direct—  you alway & into all truth & finally bring  you to glory is the prayer of your    friend & brother.  George Phippen.    Willford Woodruff.

 Brother W. Woo^d^ruff.    Sir, your Letter of the 9th. of March, dire  cted to Bishop Partridge, Presidents Joseph Smith Jr., Sidney  Rigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the saints in Zion, came safely to  them, some days since. And on account of the press of business  now on their hands, ^and the request of J Smith Jr.,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it.  You say that you have heard of the deplorable state of things in  Kirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, that  you viewed those things in their true light. Great has been the  afflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our beloved  Brotheren Joseph Smith Jr., and S. Rigdon.    In the last  summer, I Journeyed from this place in company with Wm  Smith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose of  meeting in Conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival,  we soon learned the difeculties that then existed there: these  however ware all appearantly settled, preveiously to my leaving  Kirtland: And^W^ Parish, who has since become [4 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the book  of Mormon^ [1 illegible word] ^revealed religion,^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Joseph  and the Church. Others also did the same; But this settlement  was not of long duration. Soon after this, President Hyram  Smith and J. left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: and  President Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ Wm.  Smith, soon followed us to Far West: and during their  absence, it seemes that ^Wm. Parish, J. F Bointon, Luke  Johnson, Joseph Coe, and some others, f[]ted ^united^ togeather in  for the [1 illegible word] ^repeting the proceding^ of the Church. President Smith and  his company returned on or about the 10th. of December;  soon after which this [1 illegible word] ^decenting^ band, openly, and pulickly,  renounced the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints, and claimed,  themselves to be the old standard, called themselves the Church  of Christ, excluded that of saints, and set at naught Br.  Joseph and the whole Church, denounceing them as Heriticks   
 Dear Willford  You here find the mysterious thing which was hid in the drain and  these little fellows will tell you my sentiments better than I can   myself so I leave it for them to do, thus you see that I have no  secrets but what I intend for you to know.  I think when you find and read this you will   laugh wont you — so good bye my dear   Willford for the present may God bless you  & bring you safe home is the prayr  of your Phebe  P.W.W. 
 George Phippin's answer to  Willford Woodruff  Jan 7th 1837 
 How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned from  Righteousness to wickedness. They did not understand, that by taking  upon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of the  Church of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church,  was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again,  it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, which   ^says^ saith; "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, and  the greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given to  the people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saints  here alluded to, were certainly Latter day Saints; was much, as the  above prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yet  future, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.  We have of late learned, that Parish, and the waste of this [2 illegible words] ^combination^,  have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and beome deists—  I will now Leave Kirtland, and give you some acount of the move  ment of things here, as they are and have been.  I am, [as to?] [1 illegible word], well remember the visit, which I, in company with  Elder Groves, made to the Churches in Kentucky and Tennessee, in  the summer of 1836. You also may recollect, the nature and  result, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poor  bleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of the  Children of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundred  and fifty dollars, which we delivered unto Wm. Phelps & John  Whitmer on our arrival to this place. But these men, instead  of laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleeding  Zion, purchased Land for their own instrument. They g^e^nerally  did their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^within^ the bishop  or High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ author  ities of zion: not only because they purchased land With  Church funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement,  but because they selected the place of the City Far West  and appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to be  built on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed and  ordained a committee to build the same, without  asking of seeking council, at the hand of either Bishop,  High Council, or first presidency; when it was well under  stood that these authorities were ^appointed^ for the purpose of coun  ciling on all imporant matters pertaining to the saints of  God. These two presidents also managed to get the town platt  into their own hands, that they that they might reap the avails  arising from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, with  many other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3d. day of  April 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishop  and his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W.  Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th. inst. to which time they  adjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the 
 5th., and after lbouring dilegently three days in succession, it was unanim  ously agreed upon, that the town Plat, with 4 ^four,^ eighties adjacent  to the platt, should be at the disposal of the Bishop and his council  the High Council, the two presidents, and the two apostles.  During this labour the two presidents acknoledged they were wrong, and they  to all appearances wittingly suffered themselves to be the corrected by the Council.    In the begining of May following, the Council again met, and resolved  to have the above mamed ^named^ property transfered into the hands of  the bishop, as an equivalent to the Poor bleeding zion money, and  that the avails of said land, should be thereafter applied to the benefit  of the poor, and other publick purposes. The business of the transfer  of said property, was transacted by the two presidents, the Bishop and his coun  cil, and by some means they managed to bind the bishop in a hearing  mortgage ^of three thousand four hundred and fifty dollars^ to apply two thousand dollars of the avails of the town plat ^which they had [1 illegible word]^ to  the building at the House of worship, which they intended to build ^have^ erected  Since that time, the affair of building the house has falen through.  Consequntly, many people have withdrawn ther subscription to  it, and these two men, claiming this two thousand dollars as their  subscription, chose to withdraw it, and put it into their own pockets  a small part of which has been already paid to Wm. W. Phelps.    The Council, not feeling ^willing^ that the Church should be defrauded  of two thousand dollars of her public funds, and also know^ing^ that  the Church in general as well as themselves, had become dissattisfied  with their conduct as Christians, in many things, appointed a  committee to labour with them; after which, they called the whole  church in zion togeathe, who almost unanimously voted them  out of their presidenceal office.    Not long after this, the Council  saw cause to appoint a second committee, to wait on these men  who still presisted in their opposition to the interest a[page torn]  the Church. After which, charges were prefered against them  before the Council, which were substantiated, and they were  excommunicated. Also, the Church has had much sorrow durring  the past winter, on account of the unfaithfulness of O. Cowdry,  David Whitmer, and Lyman Johnson, and in consequence of this, and  Their opposition to our beloved Brothr Joseph Smith Jr., and  the best interests of the Church of Jesus Christ, ^on^ for presisting in  the same, a number of Charges have been substantiated against  them, before the Councils & bishop of the Church, and they have  also been excluded from felloship. "How has the gold become dim  the most fine gold changed!!! But I mus drop the subject for want of  room. suffice ^it^ to say Bretheren, J. Smith Jr. & S. Rigdon are now  with us, the Church now flourishes, and the Saints rejoice,  and the ^intended^ enemies of the Church are down. You will see by the above  prospectes, that your anxious desires for the Journal are about to be granted.    May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, bless you, and keep you unto  his coming and kingdom, Amen! My love to all the saints in those  regeons.   Yours in the Love of God. Thomas B.

 P. S. Since Br. Joseph Came to this place, we have been favored with a lengthy  revelation in which many important items are shown forth. First. that the  Church, shall hereafter be Called "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter  day Saints" Second it saith ^says^ "Let the City Far West be a holy and a  consecrated land unto me, and it shall be called most holy, for the ground  upon which thou standest is holy: Therefore, I command you to build a house  unto me, for the geathering togeather of my Saints, that they may worship me" &c  It also teaches, that the foundation or corner stone must be laid on the 4th.  of July nex, and that a commencement must be made in this following season,  and in one year from the 26th. of April last, the foundation must be  again commenced, and from that time, to continue the worke untill  it is finished. Thus we see that the Lord is more wise than men, for  Phelps & Whitmer thought to commence it long before this, but it was  not the Lords time, therefore, he overthrew it and his appointed his   own time. The plan is yet to be shown to the first presidency, and all the  saints, in all the world are commanded to assist in building the house  Thomas B. Marsh.—    Mr. Wilford Woodruff  Vinalhaven.

 Montrose Lee County Sept. 1st 1840    My Dear Wilford    I sit down this morn. to acknowledge the reception   of your letter bearing date of June 3th & after sending many times to the office  for a letter the day before yesterday I was persented with a letter from you brought   by some of the brethren from Eng. as I learned that 4 family arrived in Commerce the 27  of this Aug. I have not seen any of them or learned any of their names ^yet^ and report says that   there are 30 families more in Cincinata Ohio, on their way to Commerce. I was truly glad   to hear from you of your health and the prosperity of the work with you—your last   letter before this came to hand the middle of June dated April 24 you say you   sent me 4 letters since you arrive in Eng. I have received them all  and have sent you 6 before this am verry sorry you have not received more   of them particularly my Jan. one in that I spare you a more particular acc-  -ount of my situation and how things were with and around me and I   commenced this morn with a determination to tell you something more but   what shall I say I am almost inclined to pass over the past but as if I   cannot tell my dear Willford about my troubles who can I tell while those   around you me say I dont write anything to make him uneasey but I will  give you a brief sketch of the situation of things with me who since you left  me. — For 2 week after you left me I ejoyed quite good health then was taken with  the fever and ague in a few days I was moved that is my bed and some other things  out to brother Smoots where I had ^the best^ attention the house could afford although it had  no floor in it or door or window—I was sick with the chills about 3 months and   little Sarah was verry sick to for days together I was not able to sit up to   have my bed made. I was reduced so low I remained there 8 or 9 weeks and   sister Smoot was taken sick my house was not done and it was with the  utmost exertion that I could get any thing done to it if sister Taylor had   not moved into my room with sister Pratt in Montrose I thought of going there   but I did not blame her in the least about it I think she could not help it   as she was situated—about the forepart of Nov. they called it done it had no   door or window or loft in it the roof verry poorly laid on so that the snow and   rain came in verry plentifully the snow would be a number of inches deep and   mostly over the floor thus was my house finished when I moved into it and   I had the chill and fever then and could not sit up only apart of the   time and Sarah was unwell to I had a young girl with me 2 weeks then   she left me and then I had to do as I could with little Sarah cow and all   I did not sit up all day thong but got much slandered for haveing that girl so long

 my house was exceeding cold with much of the daubing out of it and I was much  troubled for wood I suffered much with my dear little Sarah for want of wood  brother Avery in this neighbourhood was appointed bishop and when I asked him  for any thing he was cross and would complain, so one day when my floor   was covered with snow and I had not one stick of wood or more fire than   could be put into a pint cup nor had I had any for about one week accept   some little sticks the children had picked up for me. I was sitting close in   one corner with a shawl on and my child under it to keep her from the snow  which then came in on us and the weather was severe cold brother Pesly  Clark called to see me and saw my situation he went home and told   his father and he sent for me immediately to come and make it my home at  his house and made me as welcome as my fathers house he took my cow and   calf and kept them through through the winter—the people in Loovely street   was tired with me for not selling my calf some of them talked of making   me sell my clothes to provide for myself—but I trust those days are over   and they are kind to me here their family is large and I thought you would   certainly be home this fall but I am now fearful of it father Clark still tells   me to stay there untill you come home. My health grew better soon after   I went there and the most of the time I was comfortable through the winter  sat up most of the time—On the 22 of march my babe was born for 2 weeks   I was comfortable then was taken with the chills which lasted me untill June  in the time my babe was verry sick and had the hooping cough and seamed   near dying he has since that had 2 verry sick turns and is verry low now   I think it verry uncertain whether you ever see him in this world or not  of the 16th of July our little darling Sarah was taken sick and died on the   17 as I have told you the particulars in a letter sent by L. Snow—since  June my health has been quite good—before little Sarah's death I felt quite   reconciled to your absence although I have had almost one continued scene of   trouble since you left me—but since her death I cannot feal reconciled to   my situation I feell far more lonely than I have at all particularly now my   babe is so sick I have to bear my trouble alone no Willford or relative to   sympathise with me and can you tell me my dear companion who has   a better ^right to^ share to a part of your attention and kindnes than your best friend  your absence renders me miserable indeed since last July had you been at   home I think our dear child might have been living but I forbear for   this is a heart rending subject to dwell upon. I must say that I want   you to come home exceedingly this fall if you do not know of a certainty that  the Lord requires you to be there if so I suppose I must submit to it and if I   live, live through another cold lonely winter. Yes my heart sinks within me when   I think of spending my life mostly alone but I me intend to go with you some times

 Dear Brother Stanly Building Bath Street   Liverpool Aug 1st  1845    Elder Taylor    Beloved Brother    I wish once more to call your  attention to the subject of your Times & Season in this Country   We have rented a New Office called Standly Stanley  Building Bath street Liverpool where we wish all addresses   to us directed hereafter it is a vary [suitable] office much more  so than the one we have had. And as your papers have   been brought here & I am now about to take charge of them   I wish an understanding with you upon the subject   All that I have written to you heretofore upon that   subject I have said according to the statements made to   me by Elders Hedlock & Ward I know nothing about it   more than what they have said. In a letter I got from   Nauvoo I was informed that some one told you from  Scotland that if he had known they were in this country he   could have sold them all. I dont know who the person was  but who ever he might be I think he was mistake in that. I do   not know how great a little exertion the Brethren have   made here to sell them but they advertised them several times  in the Star & Elder Hedlock says that in his travels through  England & Scotland in all his conference, He spoke of them  The Stars speak for thousands upon that subject. But I will   here say since I have come their is not a Book in England   I have taken more pains to try to sell than the Times & Seasons    [written in sideways text] Coppy of a letter   To Elder J Taylor  Nauvoo Aug 1st  1845 [end of sideways text] 
 men that do business through agents for others to sign their   own names, as in the case of Emigration my name   as yet is not known in Liverpool at all in that line of   Business. R. Hedlock as yet has carried on the Business  & the ownly name known. I rejoice much that  the Covenants is recived to the Church & whare it can go   in the prayer channel, & will give us the privilege of printing  it throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Canida,  the East Indies & all over the world whare Brittania swings  her septer, & as far as any door opens for me to attend to   it in France or Germany or anywhare els I will do it. We have   blocked up the fway forever through out the British dominions   against Rigdonites or any other apostates dallying at all  with the Covenants by securing it ourselves & my anxiety   upon the subject has been very great untill it was accomplished  As to the remarks made in your letter concerning the council  given me not to Emegrate any more on your account or the account   of the office in a I would say that I have not Emegrated any soul  since I came or given any council for any to be Emegrated on the   account of the Office but I have councilled against it. Their are   one or two still remaining who you have sent orders for to be  sent away the orders sent by Br Hedlock, & a letter came  yesterday to Br. Clark to send a number of persons who had  left you & Br Clark have some notes & glass or sumthing of   that Nature with your name & Br Rudlock signed to   it, but we will get along the best we can with all these   things 
 Margarett Smoot on  the Death of Sarah Emma  July 17th 1840 
 Stanley Building Bath Street Liverpool  Sept 4th 1845    Dear Brother Smith    I sit down in great haste to drop  a few lines to you this is the first time I have had an  oppertunity to forward you your steel pens since I  have obtained them I have done you up these  Boxes of pens & one & a half dozen of pen holders & when  you have worn them out send me word & I will  send you more I dont know how good they are  but they are as good as I could get. the whole cost  about 10/ shillings sterling, I hope they will answer  your purpose. I have not yet been able to get  the drawing paper & penscils for sister Smith I may obtain  some hereafter if so I will forward it to you In fact I   have been overwhelmed in business of one knid & another so  that I have not had time to attend to such things as   I would have liked. As to News in this Country I would   ownly say that the work is on the increase through most all  the conferences & Churches. I attended a conference last  Sunday at preston their had been 45 Baptized during the   last 3 months I thatought that was well considering it was   the old tramping ground Elder Hardy has been presiding  there but must now go home I appointed a presiding  Elder over the preston Chuch & another over the conference 
 see my address to the Churches in the land Vol 5 No 9  also Vol VI No 3. & in all my travels since I have been here  in conferences & councils I have urged the sail of that work   the sail of it does not interfere with any Books in this land   I Brought about one dozens of the IV Vol Bound some I gave to  some of my American Elders & what I sold I sold of 8/  the Brethren thought that if they were bound & sold for  6/ shillings that they would readily be disposed of But I   have told them that will not do it will neither satisfy you   nor pay the cost, but I have concluded tnot to bind them   at all, but do all in my power to sell them as they   are at 8/ per volume that is about the same as $2 per Vol  I am confident they will not fetch more than that   & if you can get that it is better for than for   them to lie on the shelves here for years I am   starting some churches whare are laying by a little each  week so when they get 8 shillings they will take one I will   do any thing I can cheerfully upon this subject & I will   not charge anything for my trouble, & Ias I am about   to take them into my own hands I have been to the trouble   of counting each Number of the 4th & 5 volume all over report  so that I know what I do reveal of them the duty on them   is 6/ per pound & some other expenses of cartage &c Elder Hedlock   said that you have required the duty & all expense to be added   to $2 per vol he says it will amount to near 9/ per vol  & that this is the reason why no more could be sold. 
 Stanley Buildings Bath Street Liverpool  Sept 4th 1845    Dear Brother Clayton    While the wicked, the Righteous  & all nature is wraped in sleep I seat myself to say a  few words to you Firstly I will come to business  matters, I recieved the two peaces of paper you sent me  in president Youngs Litter. The order of Brother Blackhurst  that was sent for the Books of Mormon that were in the office  has Been appropriated according to the order ie they have nearly  all been sold & applyed to the Temple accout so says Elders  Hedlock & Ward the exact amout I have not as yet been  able to assertan though the multiplicity of business but thy  inform me that it is all on Book, their is left of them  37 common & 9 Best & as fast as they are sold the  money is put with Temple funds & will be accounted for  As to the last order I immediately sent to Preston  to inquire into it & recieved the following answer  by the presiding Elder of that conference, that  Beardsworth had let Blackhurst have some money at  some time & that Blackhurst had told him to take  his pay out of the Books of Mormon, and Beardsworth  had apostitized & sold evryone of the Books of Mormon  to make his money he had sold them for 2/ & the  best for 3/6 which made Book of Mormon vary cheap  in that region for a while at any rate I was informed that   I could neither get a Book of Mormon nor any money  from that source on that order so you must act acordingly  The process of Tithing in this country is attended with such  care & labour. I have a large Book of printed Recpts

 Stanley Buildings Bath Street Liverpool  Sept 6th 1845    President Brigham Young    Dear Brother    This is to inform you that I  have forwarded Elder Lorenzo D Barnes trunk  with all its contents to you for Examination  by the hand of Elder James Houston when you  have examined it taken int into your custody  & retained his Journals or any thing els that you   think will be a benefit to the Chuch as touching his  life or Hisstory you can forward to his Father &  Mother & friends such things as you in your wisdom  think proper when an oppertunity offers I have no  doubt but his friends ie fathers family would Highly  prize any articles he has left that may fall into his  their hands But these matters are left to your own  Judgment. I also send a package of the last Stars to the  Twelve directed to you. please distribute them as you  have an oppertunity. Br Hedlock is about clearing the ship  Oregon with about 760 passengers for Nauvoo I forwarded  you a letter conserning the Bell & Clock whethe it should be  purchased in America or England I shall be looking for an  answer from you soon. I consider it Due Elder Houston  to say he has proved himself worthy true & faithful in all 
 Lines on the death of Sarah Emma Woodruff    How short is life! Tis but a transient glow,  Thats's often dim'd by sublunary woe—  So short is life—So feeble is its beam,   It scarcely glimmers ere its end is seen!    We'ere ^we've^ seen the Aged 'neath a weight of years,  Resign their breath, and leave this vale of tears—  We've seen amidst their glory and their prime,  Dear friends, remov'ed from all the scene of time—  We've seen the youth both beautiful and gay,  By sickness seiz'd, and borne by death away,—  We've seen sweet Babes their tender eylids close,  Forget to weep—and sink in still repose:  Yes Sarah to—Dear Babe!—Her journey's o've o're  She breath'd—she wept—but she shall weep no more.    How short her time by providence assigned!  About two years she was on earth confined!  Angelic bands her spirit did convey,   To happier [realities] in everlasting day:  Our babe has first arrived at home,  To see the splendor of the eternal throne.    Like some fair plant to chillings winds expos'd.  (Before the tender bud its leaves disclos'd)  Whhich pluck'd by gentle hands, was borne away,  To some fair clime to bloom in bright array, 
 I forwarded according to your request your remarks to Wm  Miller on the £5 on land that you spoke of. Concerning the   Bell for the Temple I will to say that I will do all in my   power upon that ^subject^ I have made an appeal to all the Elders through  the Star, & also made diligent Enquiry concerning the praice of  the Bell & Duties on the same & we have also concluded to   try to furnish a clock as well as a Bell if it will be a  agreeable. We will endeavor to furnish means to pay for both  as soon as possible but now the question arises whether we  these things canot be furnished to much better advantage in   America than in England for the Duties are vary high   they are 30 per cent I can get a Brass Bell 2000 lbs weight  for about £140 about $600 dollars the duties on that in the  United State a landing would be about £42 pounds or $204, this you  see is a heavy amount for Duty, the whole would be £182, or—  $about $800. We can the price of an Iron Bell would be about  £20 $100 but I have no Idea that the Lord wants an   Iron Bell. As to a clock as to the price of a clock it would   depend upon what kind of one it was, whether it should have   one face or four whether lighted or dark some have thought that   one of the first quality would cost £100 or $500 but as you   said nothing about a clock I dont know whether you think of having   one or not, or whether you have made arangements for one   els whare. Now Br Young I wish you would ascertain what   a Bell can be obtained for in the United States & if by purchasing  it there the duty can be secured so much the Better as it   will save $200 if the Bell can be purchased there we will forward 
 out of the preston Saints. We need American Elders  vary much to assist us in this land. I shall  look for some as soon as they get their Endowment  If I can strike hands with one true & faithful  man who has his Endowment in this land I will  think the Lord. Elders M Holmes & L Hardy are the ownly  Americans that are going home now the others I shall  hold on to untill I get some more help, the  work is generally much better than I could expect  considering the few labourers in the Country. Ione  or two Rigdonites has been through this country  of late trying to esstablish Rigdonism but   every place as yet they have visited they have gone  out of it as soon as they went in their care  has been so prompty attended to by all Elders they  have met that they consider their pilgramage a hand  are getting weak in their faith & begin to deny their  own calling at least are trying to palm themselfes  off as Saints if others do not faire any better  than those that have come it will not pay them  for their trouble the truth is Rigdonism will   find hard work to ever find a foot hold in this  land the Judgments of God are still in the Earth in  the Easten world a dreadful whirlwind has desolated a  spot in fFrance of late many lives & much property  was lost. Asia Minor is desolated by famine 
 one of which I give to the Treasuer of each Branch or to each  person that sends a donation to me if not through the book of  the treasurer I also keep a duplicate of the same which  remains in the Book, Besids this all the names is taken  down in another Book with the sum each has given & as   much of it is penny & happing subscription it makes  much writing then we have to draw a copy of the same  to send to the Trustees in Nauvoo each 3 or 6 months  as the case may be it is a vary safe but laborious  way of doing business I have been stiring them  up of late on the Clock & Bell & am in hopes they  will be rather more liberal than they have been  for I do not think they have been as forward in all  respects in this county in the tithing as in America  though I realized they are tithed & taxed & taxed &  tithed from many others sourses than from the Lord   or his Saints, & then again they do not realize the importance  as fully as they do in America as the Elders that are over  the most of the Conferences & Branches do not feel as we do  we have but few labourers in the field here at the prestent  time that understand it properly we have but about half a  dozen Americans in these whole dominions we want men  who have recieved their Endowment. I have not been able  as yet to travel a great deal among the churches wharever  I have been I have strirred them up upon these subjets  I have often thought I wished I had Elder Clayton with  me to assist in business matters as well as preaching  I recieved your request in a letter a long time since  to send you a peace of linen & a Black Lace veil 
 Elder Ward has sold the Stars Bound for 3/6 & 4/ the   cvenants Bound are sold for 3/6 & all publications are   cheeper in England than in America & when they come to   see 9/ charge for the Times & Seasons ^unbound^ it frightens them   & as you allow for sale evry 10th Vol to agents I have   thought if you would allow them to be sold for 8/ I   would throw in my own trouble & try to get agents   that sell in the conferences & churches ^to^ do the same which   would mostly make up the loss. I wish you to informe   me as soon as you get this after considering all these  things what you are willing to do whether you are willing  to have them sold at 8/ or not  if you require 9/ per Vol  for them I think it will take many years to dispose of   them for they have now been here over two years & ownly   £ 3,3,0 worth have been sold while the expenses & Duty   has been £ with the £ 5, sent you £22,13,9. If it was   my care property I would far prefer to sell them at 8/  or even some less than to have them lie on hand as they   probably would at 9/ but when you come to consider  all these things if you say hold on to them at 9/ I   will do so. I will do by them as well as I would if   they were my own. I hope Br Taylor will not think   that I am wishing to dictate him concerning his property  But I have done as I would wish to be done by in   making these statements. Their has ownly one or two  volumes of the fifth Vol been sold in consequence of their not 
 things on this mission has Baptized about 100 Built up  a good church in Scotland & done well. I am Enjoying goo  comfortable health at the present time but my cares & labours  have been of such a nature that for a length of time that  I have grown rather lean & old I wish you to let Br  Houston have a little private conversation with you  Ias I have confidentially had some conversation with  him upon a subject that I have not heretofore felt disposed  to communicate by writing but I may do so hereafter  I want anoth an interest in your prayers that I may  be sustained in my office & place & fill it with dignity  & honor in all righteousness before God. Mrs. Woodruff  has been out health for sever days & is confined to her  beed at the present time brought on by overexertion  since her confinement. But I think she will not  be Ill Long my too two children arwith me are  both well. We have not been able to find the Key of  Elder Barnes Trunk Elder Hedlock laid it away & it  could ^not^ be found we also think the lock is injured in some  way we cannot open it if the Custom House officers  should Break it open at New orleans Elder Houston  would Notify you of it. if not you will have  to open it when it arives at Nauvoo. I rejoice  at the good News I hear from Nauvoo from

 Stanley Buildings Bath Street   Liverpool Oct 1st 1845    President Brigham Young    Beloved Broth & President  in the Kingdom of gGod whom I love of a truth for  the truth sake that dwelleth in you    I seat myself once  more in this life to make an address to you with  pen & ink I have now lying Before me three letters  from you of Dates Feb 11 by A Fielding June 27th  & lastly Aug 21st All of which I feel thankful for  all these favors for you may rest assured they operate  upon my spirits like a live coal from off the Altear  which kindle a flame in my soul I feel to magnify   ^inspired & uphold^ the name of God for the manner he has sustained you  since the death of Joseph & Hyrum  & the way he is giving a signal victory  to the citizens of Zion the City of Joseph. I look upon  it myself as a great omin of & evidence that the   time had come to favor Zion & that her Land   & light must & will sped spedily go forth propelled  by the spirit & strength of the God of Israel untill  Zion arises will all her strength power beauty & glory  untill she fully accomplishes all that the Ancient   prophets anticipated yea I rejoice in the prosperity  of all of which your letters speak My prayers have  assended day & night before God that he would not 
 the means as fast as it can be obtained to pay for   the same as soon as you assertain please forward me   word. You will see in all my addresses & teaching that  we published in the Star that I have thoroughly urged  the necessity of all the Saints in this kingdom strictly  abiding by the Laws of the land which agrees   with your council. As to News in this country  I will say as a general thing we are prospering inevry part   of the vineyard before what we could expect considering  the Extent of the field & the few Experienced Elders that   are in it there are still some few Conferences yet   that are some out of order & behind the time but in   all such cases it is for the want of a change of   officers to preside over the conferences but we have   no time for a Elders on hand to make the change with   fo[u]r out of Eleven thousand Saints Scattered over such   a vast field we have ownly about six American Elders   to supply the whole with except 2 or 3 of us in Liverpool   & nearly all that are here else expecting soon to   leave for America to be in Nauvoo in the Spring  and if we can hold our own untill we get 50   or 100 good wise Judicious men next spring after the   Endowment to our help we shall do well. O how I should   rejoice to think back with a company of such men   on these shores. For I am now in one [servis] alone  though surrounded by many. The Lord has been with 
 Ah! she, thrice happy Babe,—By hands Divine,   Was raised to bloom in a more healthful clime,  Where sin does ne'er appear, nor grief, p nor pain,  But peace and joy uninterupted reign:  Remote from ill, secure from earthly woe,  Where chilling blasts are never known to blow.    Yes Sarah Lovely Babe! Her infant frame  No more shall feel the smart of mortal pain.  She only sleeps! Though motionless she lies,  Her sacred dust, refin'd, again shall rise  To shine in bliss most exquisitly bright,  Surpassing far the sun's refulgent light.    And is she dead? O no! She enter'd life   The moment she escaped this world of strife:  For here by tedious flight tehe mind aspires,  And though, the senses all its skill acquires;  And waits imprisoned 'till by slow degrees,  The organs strengthen, and the spirit sees,  O feels (by meanes of sense) the things around,  O harks, delightd delight'd, to the pleasing sound,  But now from earth removed; her soul expands,   And by the throne in holy rapture stands;  Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streames,  And basks delighted, in unsully'd beames;  Now hears with wonder the melodious strain,  And joins to celebrate Messiahss name;  Her mind illumin'd now with glad surprise,  Sees happier worlds, unseen by mortal eyes, 
 being complete I suppose from the counting of them that   it was intended for 400 copies of each Vol but they very  may materially as they now stand the following is a true   account of them as they come into my hands    [sideways text]          Vol 4th   Vol 5th          1- 356 1- 393    2- 361 2- 383    3- 362 3- 400    4- 361 4- 391    5- 366 5- 289    6- 362 6- 413    7- 351 7- 390    8- 362 8- 392    9- 362 9- 385—    10- 356=9 10- 388    11- 353=7 11- 389    12- 362 12- 382    13- 360 13- 368    14- 308 14- 381    15- 374 15- 399    16- 362 16- 390    17- 362 17- 382    18- 367 18- 394    19- 368      20- 366      21- 367      22- 374      23- 368      24- 366      [end of sideways text]    Thus you see the lowest Number of the 4th Vol is 308  while 15 & 22 are as high as 374. Also Vol 5th No 5 as low  as 289 while No 6 as high as 413. Many of the 5th Vol were   just as they were when they came from Nauvoo not opened at all   & still they served in their Numbers as much as any other.  Their has bean som bad managemet some whare in   counting them out but the list I have given you is Just   as they now stand I had two hard days work counting them   over & I found in Vol 4th No's 11= & 10 7 numbers of the first  part of No 11 & the last part of No 10 was put together which spoiled   7 numbers of both 10 & 11. Before I left the office the Tim[es]   & Seasons were all counted out & we found a good  many spare Numbers more than would make full   volumes if you could send me 43 extra Numbers of the   14th No of the 4th Vol it would make 43 full volumes more   than what we now have here & whare you see any of   these Numbers deficient on this list & you have any of the same 
 time to time. I pubished some Extracts in  the last Star from your letters But fleft out  any items that I did not wish to pubished to the world  yet they were good news to me. please send  us some good wisle faithful Americans when they  get their Endowment that will act in consont  with me in this land & I shall rejoice therein  Broth pYoung please answer me the following  question in some of your communications to me    When a person is cut off the second time for  Adultery is their any way whareby He can be restored  to the Church? the Doctrins & Covenants conveys an idea  that they cannot but if their is any exceptions to that rule  please informe me of it. my councils has been asked  in one or two cases of this kind in this country but  I do not give any council to the Saints that comes in   contact with the face of the covenants & my concil  has been not to recieve such into the church. I  received a letter from Elder Dan Jones yesterday  saying that for the last month he had Been  meeting from one End of the principality to the

I am Enjoying  a tolerable degree of health as is my wife & children  my little Joseph is a fine child & doing well  All the American Elders are well as far as   I know. We hear good News from the City of  Joseph all the while for which I feel thankful  I suppose you have interesting times continually  with you. as to myself I can say of a truth   in no stage of the Chuch or of my labours have  my cares been as great as since I have been heree  in fact some of them are of such a nature that  it makes me grow old & poor But with the  Blessings of God I think I shall weather it all & live  to again see my my Native country.    give my love to Sister Smith your Father &  all who inquire after me, Also Mrs Woodruff  writes to be remembered to all    As Ever I reman Your Friend & Brother    W.

 this is the first time I have had a chance of sending  direct I have forwarded a package to you contining a   peace of fine Linen & Veil forwarded by Elder James   Houston the Bill you will find in the package  as follows 26 yards Linen 1/5 £ 1.16.10 one  one Black Lace veil £ 1.1.0 (Total £ 2.17.10) this I  paid out of Temple money as you  directed I hope they will suit you Mrs Woodruff  picked them out according to the Best of her judgment  I am doing all in my power to gather money  Enough to pay for a Bell & Clock I have forwarded  word to Elder Young to see what they can be   purchased for in America if they can be got  nearly as cheap there as in England it will save  the heavy duty of 30 per cent. The work of the Lord  is prospering thoughout this country better than  what we could expect considering the few labourers  in the vineyard. All the Conferences are Replying  many whare American Elders are labouring Manchster  is doing exceding well under Elder Holmes ^in^ Preston  has ^Ben^ Baptized 45 the last 3 months under Elder Hardy  & nearly all the Branches throughout the kingdom are on  the increase, some few Rigdonite missionaries have  visited this land but for some reason or other their stay  has been exceding short, & they are now trying to get  back to America it does not take root in this land  they know nothing about the Stranger the judgments of God are

 ownly do by his servant Brigham Young as he did  by Joshua of old after the death of Moses But that  he would do as much better by him as the work  greatness labour & work of this dispensation required [##Joshua 1:1-9##]  I have also reunited all the Twelve & Elders in all  the world I thank you for for all the information & scholing ^instruction^  you have given me & of so often speaking ^of^ our ownly  son in Zion. We are all well at present our youngest  son is two months old the largest & healthiest child  we ever had of his age. All is going on as well as can   be expected is this country considering all things the few  wise labourers &c. Elder Jones I think is doing well in   Wales he has laboured faithfully, sown much seed that   is now taking root & begining to bring forth much  fruit, within a few days past they have Baptized two  Campbellite Evangelist or ministers & they are ordained  priest I ordained one of them & a prospect of ther doing  much good Br Jones has preached vary extensively  in the largest cities & towns though that Welch  domain & said their was nearly a hundred added  tho the Branches in that land a few weeks before he   left, ^to pay me a visit^ I have held on to what few Americans their  is in this land according to your request exept   Elders Holmes & Hardy from Georgetown Mass they  had settled their affairs & about ready to sail when  your letter arived & Elder Hardys family is   in such a cituation He is obliged to go home   so I did not stop them but I think we can 
 me on this mission thus far, & have been enabled  to perfect much of a union in many conferences &   Branches & at the present time they are Baptising through  most of the confrences. One Rigdonite Missionary   has made his arival & we understand others are following  I have not yet been able to get the name of the   one that has come, he has been careful to keep away   from me, his stay in Liverpool was of vary short duration  for though he tried hard but he said he could do no good   He went to Manchester Conference & he met with equal  poor success he has now gone to Ireland & if those   that follow him do not have better success they will   not get pay for their trouble for the Saints in   this land have nothing to do with Sidney Rigdon or  his followers for they are strangers. We are pretty well   prepared for any Rigdonites that may visit this country  the bars we will put up. While I was in London Elder   Hyde sent a letter to Elder Ward to put his address before   the High priest quorum & send him the prophets for he was   poor, so I found his pamphlet in print on my return to   Liverpool 1500 copies, so thes pamphlets will be circulated abroad  among the chuches which will help block up Rigdonism.  we were Blessed with a fine son aon the 18th of Aug July   I Blessed him on the 8th day & call him Joseph myself &   family are all well. The late Steam Araude Brought   me Times & Neighbor from Nauvoo as late as July 2nd & letters   from Boston & New York & Philadelphi all of which bring 
 Though while on earth; unnoticed by her mind  Were all the splendid scenes of human kkind,  She now perhapse from Zion's hight sublime,  Look down and views the simple things of time;  Or, if permitted, to the earth descends,  And gladly mingles with her earthly friends:  Altho' unseen, her happy spirit near,  May hear the sigh, and see the falling tear,  May with concern behold maternal grief,  And fondly wish to sooth and give relief.    Sigh not surviveing friends - let sorrow cease—  She now inherits everlasting peace.  Tho' now you grieve, your grief shall turn to joy,  And loftiest praise shall all your powers employ:  For when - with you all earthly things are over,  Beyond old Jordans flood, on Cannan's shore,  Your lovely Babe, with rapture filled shall stand,   And shout you welcome to the promised land! 
 it would be be well to take good care of them   & not dispose of them as they will make full volumes  with what we have here. I have been looking for Elder   Fielding for a long for a long time & expected the   remainder of the 5th Vol commencing with the 19th  No as we have the 18th here. I have not thought proper  to break the 5th vol or sell a part of it untill the whole   arived, but I think I have said quite sufficient upon   this subject. I have no doubt but that you are   quite busy but still I hope you will steal time   enough to duly consider this subject & give me an   answer. As to news in this county I will merely   touch upon a few items. the 18 of July brought us a fine  Son. I blessed him on the 8th day, his name is Joseph. Father  Mother, Son & Daughters all well. The Acader Brought us   Times & Seasons May 1st Neighbor July 2nd, 1st No of the   N. York Messenger letters from Boston, Philadelphia,  & Connecticut & brought grand news I hope you will   continue to forward me the Times & Neighbor & when you   cannot find any thing els to do write a letter, all the American   Elders Here ^are^ well but what few we have got here are expecting   most of them to go home soon. The work is prosprous throughout   this country are generally well united & in the increase The   Liverpool Branch is in better order than it has been for years  Elder McGuffee that has been apostizing for more than a   year & we cut him off. But he has since been ^in^ hell & is now   broke down is as humble as a child has made a most humble confession  & is now coming into the church again. One Rigdon Missionary  has arived & more we understand are comeing but unless   those that follow have better success than the one that is now   in England that will not get pay for their trouble.

You will see the reason  of this request when you have read the whole of this communication  & also that you will notify me who have received ther  Endowment & who have not.

 are prepared for the receptince of any Rigdonites that may   come to this country I have no fears of their doing much   damage to the Church in this country land for though   our ulabourers are few we have good success in keeping the   bars up. we have published 1,500 hundred of O.

 [sideways text] Orson Hyde Dec 29 1860 [end of sideways text]    Hon. W. Woodruff, Moroni Sanpete Co U T    Dear Brother, Dec 29, 1860    I owe you many  apologies for not earlier answering your kind  letter of the 20th Ult.ins I have written to my  family in the city but once since I left, and  have seen my wife in Sanpete but about three  times since the President was here. I have been   very busy in building me a house and in  preaching the gospel. Away from home I seldom  could find a decent pen, or a half sheet of clean  paper. I have written a little through necessity  and a very little only. I might urge many other  reasons for not writing sooner, but none for want  of a disposition to write. I have not had time  even to write a love letter, however strong my in-  clinations may have been to do so. I never labor  ed with body and mind more intently in my life  than during the past season. I Am now reduced  to the size of a decent man. But my house is  so far finished that my goods are pitched into  it, and have left my family to regulate for  themselves while I go to Fillmore where I   expect to be on New Years night. I am now  on my way there.    Accept my thanks for your Kind  attention to my vineyard. It was a swamp 
 Please read the remainder of this communication to thyself    President Young    I consider that a sens of duty requires  me to lay before you certain things which have been  a source of much greif & sorrow to me since my arival  in England. sSome of the reasons why I have not before opened  my mind to you upon the subject has been that I  have not wished to trouble your mind with any  thing that I could get along without, & it has been much  against my will to find fault with my Brother & lastly  I have lived in hopes of arranging all matters in an  amicable manner without without calling your attention  to the subject at all. But I have at last come to the  conclusion that you ought to know all. You will then  understand my position & know how to remember me before  the Lord and perhaps you may be sumwhat surprised at   what I am about to reveal to you At the death of Joseph   you are well aware their was a strugling for power among  certain men in America ^have^ you have felt the wait of this   truth, in Zion So have I in Liverpool among men from  whom I looked for better things viz R Hedlock & T Ward  Their has been one Evil in this church from the Begining give men  a little extra power & influence for a season when it is called  for they are not willing to give it up or fill their own place &  sustain men in theirs at least I have found it so here  I will now give you a statement of facts as near as I  can in truth since my arival in Liverpool. When I first  landed I discovered a coldness & distance on the part of Elder Hedlock  towards me but much more to towards Br Clark after  spending a few days in getting settled I began to make inquiry   into the affairs of the office Br Hedlock said the account Books  were there I could Examine them. the Books not being kept  in a Systematical order I could not readily comprehend things

 I soon saw evry exhertion was making to prejudice my mind  against Br Clark the spirit against him was of such a   Nature that I saw he could never work with Br Hedlock  in fact the accusations against him was of such a Nature  & urged so [warningly] I was obliged to make it almost my  first business to trace up the the accusations against him  to the fountain head through all its windings it appeared  to me to be like great groanings among the mountains to   to bring forth a mouse, it Ended in this fact he had  kissed somebody but in my opinion it was more to keep  him out of the Emigration business thus to clense the  church of crime. After I settled that up I advised him  to take charge of some conference for a season untill  their was a better feeling at Liverpool. I made my   Address to the churches though the Star & had my recommend  published with it that the Saints might know that I  came with Authority from Head the proper Source I   saw that Br Hedlok & Ward seemed to he much troubled  about their standing so I made choice of them for councillors  out of respect to the men & their former standing, thinking  they would operate with me, their was nothing through the   Star but what all was right but the more I advanced toward  my place as president to take charge of things & direct them  the more I found a spirit against it & secretiveness in  all things Esspecially with Br Hedlock & Br Ward had so much  of John Bull in him that it seemed at times that it was of  more consequence to him than the priesthood, & as out of the  heart the mouth speaketh I soon sayw things in their hearts  not right if I could judge from the causes they were   persuing their feelings was we have power & influence & we   will hold it.

 Snow at Springtown is about 18 Inches deep and  at this place about 6, and only 6 miles apart. We have  had a beautifully mild season until Wednesday last when  the snow fell very freely and it became intensly cold. We have  no wind storms to do us any serious damage in the county  with the exception of about one third of the roof of the Meeting  house at Fort Ephraim which was blown off by reason  of a door being left open and the house being tight, it had  to burst. But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustained  by our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that no  human lives were lost. Speaking of Judgments, the Lord  said, "My saints shall hardly escape."

The road from the North Bend to Spanish Fork is worked  through for horsemen and empty wagons, but to make it  a good and safe thoroughfare, will require very much more  labor. Many of the citizens here have petitioned for an  appropriation to work it through.

In fact  he does all business in his own name without any regard to  me whatever as Funding Emigration Renting rooms & one  would think from his actions that he was laying a foundation  to speed generations to come upon his own Book in Liverpool  He has been to much expens this season in publishing large  handbills & cards in his own name & settled them all  over the kingdom as a general shiping agent without consulting  me at all upon these things. He is so secret in his movements  & singular in his habits that Neither myself nor any man  about the office knows whare he lives or Boards Neither can  I find out though I have asked his several times He cards  it an insult to be asked the question. He has kept the Temple  Books untill of late & signed all the recept in his own name  AHe has manifested a spirit to gain all the influence possible  I had a plain talk with Elder Ward a short time since  upon the subject. As I had heard much testimony from  others what they had said behind my back. I told Br  Ward I knew my place & my councellors out to know it  also. I informed him they could not [gruge] success or   [swallow] me that if they undertoook to ride me they would find  a hard seat before they got through. I told him that Brigham  Young & not Reuben Hedlock was president of the Church &  if Hedlock had power & influence the presidency of the Church had  given it to him. And is he was in the way of his duty he  would throw that influence into the chanel what it out  to be for the stream had run out of the chanel by Enough  I told him it was time for me to have for tiems for  Emigration & for my name to appear upon the door  post & sign Boards & hand Bills & cards as well as R  Hedlocks. Elder Hedlock had found fault because I had  interfered with the Temple Books but I have gone forward 
 P. S. I perceive by the news that Bro Gardner Snow of  Manti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He is  a very good man; but is completely wraped up in his son  Warren and in George Peacock. The people of Sanpete  have paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvements  can be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. It  is like all improvements in Manti, unfineshed. Several  Back houses have been begun, but I know not one finished  The jail in like condition. $4,500 was the contract price  for completeing it, as I am told, when $2,000 would build and  complete a much better building than that would be of finished  The county is greatly in debt, and no improvements that are  of much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered,  the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has suffered  The people have suffered by their stocks being made into  strays and then into beef. This Indian department has  suffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations going  in the same way. The people of Sanpete think the  Bourbons have reigned long enough, and that Bourban  Dynasty should end. If the county seat were removed  from Manti to Moroni or to Springtown it would  suit the notions of the people much better. If to Moroni  M. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown,  Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I have  expressed no opinion here as to the removal of the county  seat, neither any with regard to this choice of a Judge  yet the above are my true sentiments and 19 twentieths  of the people here would endorse them, the opinion  of our representative to the contrary notwithstanding 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,   Salt Lake City, Utah, Jeune 18, 1888.    R. W. Sloan, Esq.,   Chicago.    Dear Brother:    Your favor of the 13th. inst., written at Minneapolis,   has just been received and read with interest. Since our last reply to you we have   received several papers containing interviews with you.    We see nothing objectionable in your statements, when we   consider the duties that you have assumed. In any other capacity than that in which   you are acting, of course, different statements would be made. If you had not ac-  cepted the position, doubtless some other person would have done so who would perhaps  have made much broader statements than you have made, without giving information  that would mitigate the bad effect, so far as our people are concerned. If you   should be judged harshly by some who do not take into consideration all the circum-  stances, or who may not know the motive you had in accepting the position which you  occupy, it will not be the first time that motives have been misconstrued and wrong   judgements formed upon us; but we do not anticipate that there will be much of this.    We are glad to hear that Dr. Miller, our old-time friend,   still feels so kindly towards us and our rights. He has been, so far as we know, a   constant and an undeviating friend and a liberal-minded man. When you return you

Are any of them going to school, Clara and  Owen ought to go. I have not heard from any of you for  so long a time. I am as well as usual only I have  taken a little cold and got pains over one of my eyes  this morning. I want you ^to^ take good care of Henry & see  that he doesn't work too hard. I don't expect I need  to ask you to be a good girl for I expect you are always  good. I want you to give my love to Clara, Owen & Blanche.  I cannot write to them today, I expect Clara is getting  almost a young woman. I want ^to have^ her and all the  children learn all they can while they are young &  I want to give you a little council for your future  good and that is what leisure time you have to spend  devote it to study the Bible, Book of Mormon, &  covenants and you will there find those principles &  knowledge that you will need to sustain you through  and will help you to lead your children in the   principles of virtue & righteousness I think I have read  all three of these books through sinse I left Salt Lake City  and I find them very profitable. What we store up in  this life will go with us and affect us in the world to  come whatever it be good or evil, and we need all the good  we can procure to prepare us to inherit eternal life—and

I do not think that he manifest the secrecry that   the circumstinces at all times requires.

Woodruff, Moroni Sanpete Co US  Dear Brother, Dec 29. 1860  I owe you many  apologies for not earlier answering your kind  letter of the 20th Ulttno I have written to my  family in the city but once since I left, and  have seen my wife in Sanpete but about three  times since the President was here. I have been  very busy in building me a house and in   preaching the gospel. Away from home I seldom  could find a decent pere, or a half sheet of clean  paper. I have written a little through necessit  and a very little only. I might my many other  reasons for not writing, frome, but now for want  of a disposition to write. I have not had time  even to write a love letter, however strong my in-  clinations may have been to do so. I never labor  ed with body and mind more intently in my life  than during the past season. I am now reduced  to the size of a decent man. But my house is  so far finished that my goods are pitched into  it, and have left my family to regulate for  themselves while I go to Fillmore where I  expect to be on New Years night. I am now  on my way there.  Accept my thanks for your kind  attention to my vineyard. It was a suemts

 Kirtland O. January 4, 1836.  Dear Brother    Yours came to hand 8 or 10 days  since.  I hope you will pordan me for not  writing sooner, for I feel that I have a just cause  to be excused.  And this because of a multiplicity of  business.  The Hebrew School commenced this day, and I  hope that I shall be able to attend it same, but  aut of neusity I will be excluded part of the  time because of the press of business.  You have no doubt an idea in regard to  the endowment and if you should suppose that  God intends to indow a man to destroy another  because he repents not I would inform you that  your idea is incorrect, but I presume that you  have no such an idea.  God will indow no  man except he has obtained wisdom and under =  =standing enough to use power with discretion  and according to the will of God.  I presume  the solemn assembly will take place in Febu-  ary if there will be no hinderance in the comple=  -tion of the house.    I have written a letter to bro Seth Morley, and  no doubt you have seen it ere this, had I  time I would write a long letter to you.  But  I have not.  And Elder Parish wrote you and  you have the Bible Book of Mormon & Book of  Covenants these together with the Sipirit of God with   will make you wise unto salvation, and give you  inteligence to lead others into the mansions of  bliss.  I am sensible that you feel your weekness  while in the days of your youth, and so for pain  your brthren &the prophet or But be not dismayed trust in God  and you shall not be confounded, for remember  what our Savior saith of the the Ravens, and of the  Lillies of the field, they toil not neither do they spin but 
 12th  congenial spirit wandering to & fro so if all things have  not been conducted as you would wish in evry respect since  I came here I trust you will make some allowance   for my cituation I want the Anointed of the Lord to   remember me in their prayers that I may have power  to fill my place & station & overcome evry obsticle  And I am resolved to wage a warfare with both men  & Devils in the name of Jesus Christ & by virtue of the   Holy priesthood & the keys of the kingdom of God untill I   can perfect stand in the lot & place that God & the   president of the church has appointed me. You know my  Nature, make, & spirit  that I cannot sit down & rest  in peace if a work that I am appointed to do is not going   right No I never was made to fold my arms at  ease & sleep while Zion is travelling in pairs to be delivered  & while the God of heaven is whispering to me by the Holy  spirit day & right that his judgements are spedily to be poured  out open this Nations as well as America & that all the gentile  Nations will follow in their train And urging me to magnify   my calling while the day had lest Blood be found in my sheets  & then when I meet my councellor instead of bowing our keeds  Knees together to call upon God for my time to be spent in contending  for my standing place rights & place at times it makes me  sick at heart. I parktake of a portion of the same feeling that   Joseph & Brigham is accquainted with at times when they have   had to rise up & tell the people they are president for the people   dont seem to know it among so many presidents unless they  acordingly tell them off it. 
 13  I think I have said Enough upon this subject I have let  out what was in my heart & I feel a good deal Better  Any council you have to give me I will abide by it according  to the best of my ability. when men undertake to pull me  down here they try to pull you down & when they pull you down   they pull the kingdom of God down. But thank God they cant  [curse] it. I know that God is with you & I know he is   with me in this land & I shall do what I can for the   cause, though I have been telling a kind of sorrowful tale  I am not discouraged I am in good spirits the Lord is   on our side & some men will learn a lesson in days to   come. I have no disposition to injure Elder Hedlock or ward I  wish them well, though they have not taken a wise course  in all things since I came. If Elder Hedlock ever goes home  I think Elder Ward will work with me & harken to my council  He is a vary capable useful business man if he takes  a right course. I have not brought up any of these things   wishing to make an accusation or case of trial of them but that  you might know the truth of my circumstances. I know   how to pray for me. With regard to the joint stock  company Elders Hedlock Ward & Wilson are the main  officers in it at present. I think their was a spirit manifest  in some deepest at its organization against my being a   director in it but at that time I did not wish it & refused  to have as I had so much on hand but as most of the  members & Directors are members of the Church I think  they will harken to our council upon the subject I have  tried in all my council & Teachings to impress upon  the minds of all the importance & Necessity of walking by  the council of the presidency of the church & I think they will do  it. They find it much more Expressing than they expected to  get registered according to act of parlament & to get the  seal of State. It will cost over of £100 pounds 
 I have perhaps it is due Elders Hedlock & Ward to say that  in the midst of all our affairs their has been no spirit  manifest by them that they wanted to appostitize & leave  the work, but to keep what power & influence they have  & get more if they could even if it was at my expens  they had been appointed Agents & presidents over the  could Church & they could not get it into  their heads that their presidency seased when I came  I have written a letter to you about the Bell  I hope I shall have ian answer soom for if   the Bell is Bought in America to save so heavy  Duty as 230 per cent I will immediately forward the   money to you to purchase it the first safe  opportunity.

The enclosed article cut  out of a St Paul's newspaper  speaks for itself & is the oc  casion of my writing to you.  I know little, and still  I know enough of the Mormon  Faith and of the past strug  gles of your divine Church, to  have confidence in her future, 
 although I feel presently  very sensible to the repeated  persecution to which you  are subjected.    It is, by no means, an  honor for a civilized nation  to slander & to vilify a peo-  ple because of his religious  belief as they have done to  the Mormons & to track out  of every social position your  faithfull spurred with suspicion.    I am sure, most Reverend  & dear Sir, that you will   vindicate yourselves calmly,  yet firmly: charitably, yet  proudly conscious of the integ-  rity of your motives & the   impregnability of your position. 
 [sideways text]   A. E. Hinckley.  Hackberry  Jan 31 [18]83   [end of sideways text]    For President John Taylor.    Hackbery, Jan. 15th, 1883.    President Woodruff.    Dear Brother,    I sit down  to drop you a few lines. You will excuse the bad gram-  mar, spelling, without any punctuation, passing over  all, until we come to this place. On the 26th of Dec.  last we arrived at this place, and found a portion of the   Wallapais tribe of Indians here, and added to their low  and filthy condition, the corruption and diseases of civ-  ilization and, in looking forward to the time when the  Lord would fulfil his promises upon them, I realized  that it was the Lord's work, and that He would have to  work by his power, manifest in their midst, to bring it  about. I learned that this nation had no place to gather  to, to farm and till the earth. The whites have taken up  the watering places, and the Indians, in many places where  they used to be the lords of the soil, have to pay to water  their horses now. The government has stopped giving them  rations and they are in a bad condition. Still, the chief  refuses to accept of our going to any place with them, to  learn them to farm, or school their children. He says that  they were on the reservation a few years, their children to  school, many of them died, and he would rather they would  live, hunt rabbits, work for the Americans, cut wood, wash  dishes, and so forth, than gather together, be sick and die,   and he does not want us to come there with anything of the    and have not done so. They appear always to remember a   promise. Our promise is to write to the Mormon Chief,   and he will do as he thinks best, and Brother Harris is  to meet them and report to them whether there is any one comes  or not, and, if not, to tell them the reason why. There is large  tracts of good land on the Colorado River, above and below Fort  Mojave. The Shemojaves are situated in their valley about  60 miles below the Fort. There is some good land in their  valley, but most of the tribe is below there, on the reservation  on the California side, 50 miles below their valley, and a  portion of the Mojave tribe is on this side the river, oppo-  site them, on their reservation. The location is good to reach  them and the Wallapais in the Mojave Valley, and this Chief  that can read and write we think will be of great benefit to  the cause, if he obeys the Gospel. The promises made to them,  the Mojaves, was 20 years ago, or more, yet they told us of it.  This shows that they never forget, so that we made ours con-  ditional, as I said. Told them that the Lord had told our  Chief to send us out to tell them to be at peace with all,  to become one with us, to learn to do good, be brothers together.  I guess that I have written enough in my wandering way  this time. Hope that I shall be able to say more in less words  in the future.    With love and peace to all,  We remain, your brothers in the Gospel,  A. E. Hinckley. 
 kind at present. He says that he may know better after  a while, but until then this is his decision positive now.  The tribe is fast wasting away with venereal diseases.  There appears to be no place to commence with them, but  to work with their neighbors. We have been to the Mojave  tribe. They wish you to send some families to come and   work with them, teach them better how to farm and school their  children. They make two propositions—one, to go with some  of them and clear some land, 20 miles below St. Mojave;   another, on a piece of land above the fort, about four miles,  which is cleared, which the River overflows, and is sure of  making a crop. The land below is not safe or sure without  digging wells and putting up windmills. The land in both  places is very rich. The land below belongs to government and  the Railroad. That above is at present occupied by the head  Chief. The chiefs are very anxious, and also the people, to   have some of our people to come, and we think that it is  one of the best chances of bringing about the work with them.  Brother Harris has promised to be back there in four months.  He expresses himself that he would like to go and settle  there, as he says that they are the finest tribe in this Territory.  They are a very industrious people, but they have become very  much diseased and are somewhat under the control of the  whites, but there is no denomination or sect among them.  The second chief can read and write. We left with him the  Voice of Warning and promised to send to him the Book   of Mormon. His name is Mariman. If you can send    him the book, address it to him, Mariman, a Chief of   Mojave Indians, Fort Mojave. He is a well disposed  man. He says that he wants to do right when he knows  what right is. We think that he will be a very useful  man in the future. We think that 2 or 3 families at  each place could do great good. Brother Harris will  be there about the first of May, and if you think that   it is wise to send some Elders to meet him there, either  with or without their families, to commence work with  them, you will please let us know at Mesa. Direct in  care of Pres. A. F. MacDonald. If they come, the most  direct road will be by St. George, Pearce's Ferry, from thence  to Mineral Park, from there to Fort Mojave. We send this  by way of suggestion. Brother Harris will meet them, the  Chiefs, whether anyone is sent or not. It will be as you,  the Council say, whether he stops with them or not. He  has said as much, that he would like to do so, if he could  be as useful there as otherwise. He is a very zealous  man. As to myself, to be a travelling missionary than to be  located in a tribe, and indeed I believe with such a  man as Ephraim Hanks, if we were as well united  in faith and feelings as we were when we were out  to meet the hand-cart company, that we would be will-  ing to keep on south among the Lamanites until we  come to the end of them, if we could live faithful enough  to do so. The Mojaves say that the Mormons have  been to their tribe twice and promised to come back, 
 my warmest feelings for  the final success of the cause  of the Mormon faith. The   sufferings of the Saints are  the seed of the Church.

Dear Sir,  I am a  student in the High School  of this city, and the subject  of Mormonism was given  me on which to write a  paper.    I see in a recent copy   of "The Inter Ocean," your  name as President of the  Church. And as I wish  some information from  authoritive source, and also 
 much interested being with us, it  was deemed best for Bros. Campbell  and Trejo, to go over in the vicinity  of Fronteras where a person resides  who owns a small grant of land  with good timber and water claims  and whose acquaintance Bro Campbell  made last summer while in Sonora  and who was very anxious to have Bro  Campbell, go there, buy some land  and settle with them he being a good  machinist, and his family spanish   offering to sell him a league or two of  land on reasonable terms. we thought  the opening worth following up; but  as his letter indicates the indians this  spring appear troublesome, but they are  probably now in Sonora. Bro Campbell  last season put up a Mill for ex. Gov.  Resqueria (I beleive is the name) from whom  he received marked attention and respect  spending many occasional hours making

 York Hill November 18th 1853.    Dear Brother and Sister Woodruff    With a grateful sense of your kindness to my Husband  and children I take my pen to address you and try if Language  can convey my thank to both of you. My daughters Letters are full  of fresh proof of your goodness to them and yet I write to ask for  more favours still. It is a Mothers fears that constrains me to en-  croach on kindness like yours, but the Saints of God are always  ready to assist each other. My Girls are yet but very young and  not used to be left to their own will. I greatly fear for their inexperiance  in the world, that some harm may come on them if some known Friend  like Sister Woodruff does not assist me in this affair.    They both love you better than any one they ever saw before, they  will therefore listen to your advice, and be ready to do what you  think right, under these circumstances I am induced to solicit  your assistance and I hope you will watch what companions they  choose and advise them when they go rong.    They do not seem at home with their Aunt I do not know why they have  not said one word about her, or even mentioned her name, it cannot  be any fault of their Uncle for he would make them happy if he could  I am quite sure of that. I do not want Ann or Marion to go far  from your watchful eyes it is my wish that they make no new  acquaintances however fascinating for you well know that Man   and Woman may have the Tongues of men and Angels and  yet we are informed even weeping they are enemies of the cross of  Christ but by ^Their^ fruits you shall know them.

 Wrexham Monday 26 Feby. 1845    Dr Br Woodruff,    I have neglected writing until now, expecting to have the better  news to give you, because I had some forebodings of glorious consequences.  Of course Br. Stratton told you how I was getting on up to the time of his  departure. Since then I have been working my way into the heart of the  Welsh Colleries, & Ironworks, but have found my way blocked up, by the   preposesed prejudices, predicated upon the ffalse statements of returning Apostates  as well as all other lies that any Impostors, or bad men have ever ben guilty  of, all the stories I think that the Devil & his Priests can think of, are sent  the rounds here too, but as luck wd have it, by being a little sly I scaled some  of their Ramparts before they were aware, and I hope, have put in a little leaven  but the Priests here are not doing much else, but consulting together what  to do with me, the first thing of cours was to turn me out of the good old synagouge   and caution all their sheep, not to believe, or talk to me, they would not allow me to give  my reasons for leaving them, but through the influence of a friend, I got posses-  ition of one of ^their^ sanctuarys last Sabbath ^week^ about 5 miles from here, & got my own  play for the time, but since then the deacon has been under the eeves of that Sanctum  but since Br. Stratton left I have prepared a work for the press, principally about  the order ^of^ the Kingdom set up in the days of the Apostles, & illustrating the first  principles, the immutability of the Gospel &c something similar to P. P. Pratts,  on ^the^ Kingdom, in the voice of warning, but Welsh of course, twil be in pamplet  form about two sheets, or 48 pages, of twelve fold, close type, they wanted £16 pn 1000   but tomorrow I have ^to^ go & see another printer, & will make a trade with him  for a thousand copies ^for something less^ & get him to print them in two weeks, I have to depend on   you to send me that amt, by that time, for I need not expect any quarters from  any source, neither would I have any one know here my financial affairs, upon  any consideration, I have had to steer between wind & water, with friend & foe,  and carry ^a^ stiff upper lip, for I have to pay my board here & wife. My wife's illness  has kept me here rather confined, & while this work is going through the Press  I will have to be here to correct the proof sheets, but have some open hearted  friends in Wales, who have invited me to see them, some dozen miles off or so,  them of cours I will attend too, in the mean time, but after I get this workout  I will take a larger circuit, especially after conference. I am glad withal  they are making such a stir among the^mse^lves, on my act. here, I expect my wifes  ilness will be ofver before I come to conference, and I hope that by then, the  object I had hinted to Br S. about, will be acomplished, all right thus far, &c  Would I had a mate, who would go shoulder to shoulder with me in the Welsh!  But I have a p[r]ospect of one before long, one who has his hand in, but tho, I shd remain alone  I am resolved in the strength of Joseph's God, to die on the field of battle, rather   than [m]eet my kindred on that day, & found guilty of their blood, poor people, they know not   what they are doing. the best way of remittance will bye by post office.

 Salt Lake City, Aug. 8th, 1887.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff and  The Quorum of The Twelve Apostles:    Dear Brethren:    Agreeable to the wishes of the family  of the late Pres. John Taylor and also in response to a  desire on our part to see a proper biographical and chrono-  logical history of his life presented to the public we  have thought providing the matter meets your approval  and concurrence of publishing, at an early a day as possible,  a biograpy of his life, together with such contemporaneous  history, memoirs etc. as space and the scope of the  work will permit.    With reference to the propriety of the publication of such  a work, it is perhaps unnecessary for us to offer any  special argument; but it seems to us that the issuance  of such a work would fill a two or three-fold mission.  The people, we believe, would not only welcomely receive  any work which would properly recount the incidents  and lessons of the life of such a man as their late

 HOME. FAMILY.  ESTABLISHED 1879.  35,000 Members.   A GREAT FRATERNAL ORDER.  The Order of Chosen Friends.  ITS OBJECTS AND PLANS.    The Order of Chosen Friends is a Fraternal  Benevolent and Protective Society. Its business  is conducted privately, yet in such a manner that  those conscientiously opposed to secret societies  can endorse and affiliate with it.    It was established May 28, 1879, in the city of  Indianapolis, Indiana. It has now over 700  Councils and 35,000 members in the United States  and Canada. It is an Order making provisions  for paying, in addition to sick and death benefits,  one to its aged members, and also providing for a  benefit to those who become totally disabled by  reason of either disease or accident. It has met  with the approval and endorsement of the think-  ing public. The success and growth of the  Chosen Friends in the past, confirms the wisdom  of its projectors, and the adaptability of the  Order to meet the wants of thousands who are  without any, or need more, protection.    The Order is representative in its management,  having a Democratic-Republican form of govern-  ment. It is in fact, a sovereignty within itself;  self-controlling and independent. Within its own  prescribed sphere its authority is supreme. Its  members acquiesce in the teachings of its faith,  and are required to yield obedience to its laws.  Friendship and fraternal co-operation is the cen-  tral principle by which it is governed, the power  2    that gives potency to its resolves. The perpetu-  ation of the Order depends upon an adhesion to  the established principles of its ritual and its  fundamental laws, and upon the recognition by  Chosen Friends of the great principles of Fra-  ternity, Aid and Protection. The distinctive features  are briefly stated in the following    OBJECTS OF THE ORDER:    1. To unite fraternally acceptable white per-  sons of good character, steady habits, sound bodily  health and reputable calling, who believe in a   Supreme Being.    2. To improve their condition morally, socially   and materially, by timely counsel and instructive  lessons; encouragement in business, and assist-  ance to obtain employment when in need.    3. To establish a Relief Fund from which a  sum not exceeding three thousand dollars ($3,000)  shall be paid:    a. When a member becomes disabled by the  infirmities of old age: Provided, the age of  seventy-five years has been reached.    b. When by reason of disease or accident, a  member becomes permanently disabled from fol-  lowing any occupation.    c. When a member has died.    SECURITY OF THE ORDER.    The history of kindred fraternal societies  proves that the plighted faith of the members of  an organization who are bound in honor and self-  interest to maintain its integrity, can be relied  upon for protection and good faith quite as con-  fidently as business companies managed by men  whose interests are in natural conflict with those  of their patrons. The co-operation of men and  women for mutual protection, on an equitable  and economical basis, is a matter of prudence,  justified by our daily experience.    The Order has three divisions; these are:  1. Supreme Council.  2. Grand Councils and Districts.  3. Subordinate Councils.  3

Taylor deal with the vital principles of  our religion, others with our rights as citizens; and a  repetition of these like the repetition of any principle  of truth would be salutory and proper for all people, and  their existence should be kept green. Again, such a work,  if properly written and judiciously compiled, would do much  to still more fully foster and encourage the literary tastes of  the people, as it may also encourage the efforts of those  who undertake the work of publication; but we shall  not try to protractedly enumerate the possible good  which may accrue from the matter, believing that you  appreciate and understand these matters quite as well as  they they can be represented; and that if you ^it^ is  deemed wise that such a work should, be pub-  lished and placed before the people that it will  receive your full sancition and approval.

 March 1850    Dear Brother Woodruff    It is with pleasure I embrace the   present oportunity of adressing a few lines to you   respecting your clothes. Our work fell off as I   antisepated and with the sanction and   councle of Bro Cartwright. I got the cloth of   my Employer as he profered me aney thing I   wanted at wholesale prices, as he said was his   custom to his Employes, and I did it the more   readeyly before the money was obtained, as I should  not then be restricted to a few shilling in the   price of the article as we should have been after   a scertain amount had been obtained    I selected a good firm Bodey'd cloth for coat and   vest one that I beleive will weare well and   strong. it is wool dyed, and cost 4 1/4 p. yd   and the pantaloons are the heavest and best that is   made and I beleive you will say it is the best   price of good's evver you had it cost 2.88 per yd   and I hope it will give you and Sister Woodruff   satisfaction I was in hopes to have seen you   before you left New York, to have tried on a   calico coat I cut out, expecting to see you but   not haveing the oportunity I made it to the   measure, and if there is aney part of it which   requires alteration I shall be happey to do so 
 The Supreme Council is regularly incorporated  under the laws of the State of Indiana.    From this body emanate all laws for the govern-  ment of the Order, and to it is entrusted the en-  tire management of the Relief Fund.    Subordinate Councils are local organizations for  the extension of the Order in their immediate  vicinity. They have the power to solicit, accept  and reject members who are admitted on petition,  by ballot. Every applicant for membership must  be over eighteen years of age, of good moral char-  acter, steady habits, reputable calling, sound  bodily health, and believe in a Supreme Being.    The admission of members is guarded by pro-  tective rules similar to those of the Masonic, Odd  Fellows, and other successful fraternal organiza-  tions, and for beneficiary membership by a   thorough medical examination of each candidate.    Beneficiary membership is optional with the  member. The Subordinate Council is expected  to provide for the social, moral and intellectual  improvement of its members, for the relief of  the sick, for the assistance of those out of employ-  ment, for the encouragement of its members in  business, and for the inculcation and dissemina-  tion of the principles of Fraternity, Aid and Pro-  tection. By-Laws to accomplish this are framed  by each Council as desired.    Meetings are held weekly or semi-monthly and  members must pay dues quarterly in advance.  Each Council fixes the amount to be paid as dues.  One dollar per quarter is recommended, if Coun-  cil does not pay sick benefits.    HOW COUNCILS ARE INSTITUTED.    Subordinate Councils are organized by the  Supreme Councilor, or his representatives ap-  pointed for that purpose, on the application of  twenty or more persons possessing the necessary  qualifications, and who agree, by ballot, at the  time of organization, to associate with each other  in fraternal relation.    This Order permits an unlimited membership on the  Charter list Strong Councils, with a large mem-  bership in each, are preferred.  4    MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS.    A rigid medical examination is required by an  authorized Medical Examiner, and the applica-  cation must be approved by the Supervising  Medical Examiner before the member can be-  come beneficiary.    EXPENSE OF ORGANIZATION.    No Charter fee is required. A set of supplies  sufficient usually to last the Council for several  months, and most of the books will last for years,  is furnished free. The membership fee is $5.00.    This fee, each applicant for beneficiary mem-  bership must pay, and it covers    Medical Examiner's Fee As agreed upon  Supervising Medical Examiner's Fee $0.50  Certificate Fee 1.00  Balance is placed in Council Treasury.    In addition to the $5.00 above mentioned, each  beneficiary member must pay one advance Assess-  ment, according to age and amount of Relief  Fund Certificate (see table of rates).    Social members are not required to pay Medi-  cal Examiner's fee or assessments, but must pay  a Certificate fee of $1.00; which certificate can  be exchanged for a Relief Fund Certificate should   the member become beneficiary within one year  from the date of initiation.    The membership fee must be paid to the Sec-  retary; Medical Examiner's fees and Supreme  Medical Examiner's fees, to the Medical Exami-  ner; all other fees, to the Secretary of the Coun-  cil, to be applied as directed by the Constitutions  and Laws.    RELIEF FUND.    There is connected with this Order a Relief  Fund, from which each member, or the properly  designated beneficiary, is entitled, under the pre-  scribed regulations, to draw a sum not exceeding  the amount named in the Relief Fund Certificate.    These certificates are issued either in the  amount of five hundred, one, two or three thou-  sand dollars, as the member applying for the  same may elect, subject, however, to the approval  5

 when we meet, but I have every confidence   in its both fitting and pleasing you   I should have written before, in fact I did   write when I had it partly done but when  I enquired for your adress I found Bro Cartwrigh  had sent to you. I thought it was useless for me   to send untill the clothes was finished, and then   you will please lett me know how they do   and aney little advice you can give us respecting   our coming Jurney for with the Blessing of God   we intend to come on with Bro Cartwright   My wife and me long for the day to be out of this   place for ever since we have been here it is like  being on forbidden ground. we feel in sincerity   a continual anxiety to get away from here we feel   as though when we came here w[e] had sliped  from under that sweet Influence which used   to surround us in Liverpool I feel to thank God   that our lives has been precious in his sight   and that we where spaired on the day of the   Explosion as it happend I may say next door   to us in that little street, in which our side   Door stands I dare say you recolect its position   it Burst open our room door smashed the back   window and rocke'd the House like a cradle   in fact I thought the House was falling and   I was more surprised to find it was not   so than I should have been to be huried into 
 Cincinnati Oct 23rd 1849    Dear Brother Woodruff    I take this opportunity to write  these few lines to you in order to asertaine  what restitution I and my wife are to make  in order to be brought into the Church as we  are both willing to do all that lays in our  power for we take it very hard to be here  and cannot enjoy ourselves with the Saints  of God. we are willing to make acknow-  ledgement to all that we have done and  we are determined to keep the command-  ments of God for the future, but at the  same time believe that there has been  a great deal said that was not true but  what has been done was through the  teachings of William Walker and others  while we were in England. the reason my  wife left New York was because of the  scandle that was raised about her by  Mr J D Brown for he stated that my   wife was in the family way be Littlefield  which has proved itself fals so my wife  thought she would come to me and get me  to write to N York to you but I took very  sick so that I could not write in time before  the letter came to this place stating 
 of the Supervising Medical Examiner, who has  full authority to refuse an application, or to re-  duce the amount as he shall deem right.    Beneficiary members are required to pay into  the Relief Fund an amount, graded according to  age, as follows:    TABLE OF RATES.    AT THE AGES OF ON $500. ON $1,000. ON $2,000. ON $3,000.          18 and 25, incl., $0.35 $0.70 $1.40 $2.10          26 and 30, incl., .40 .80 1.60 2.40    31 and 35, incl. .45 .90 1.80 2.70    36 and 40, incl. .50 1.00 2.00 3.00    41 and 45, incl. .60 1.20 2.40 3.60    46 and 50, incl. .75 1.50 3.00 4.50    51 and 54, incl. 1.00 2.00 4.00 6.00    And this amount, paid by the applicant on  applying for a Relief Fund Certificate, remains  his or her Assessment for life (or until 75 years of  age), and is paid, without notice or demand, on  the first day of each calendar month, except when  the Assessment is remitted, which is done when  the amount in the Relief Fund is sufficient to  pay all claims that are, or may be, presented  during the succeeding month.    Up to July 1, 1894, this Order has issued  90,000 Relief Fund Certificates to members.  It has received and disbursed for its objects  $8,500,000.00. It is now paying benefits at the  rate of about $3,000 every day in the year.    SECURITY OF FUNDS.    All officers of the Order who have charge of  any of its funds are required to give sufficient   bond for the faithful discharge of their duties.  These bonds may be increased from time to time,  and are always in a sum not less than double the  amount the officer will probably at any time have  in his hands. In addition to these safeguards,  such an arrangement has been made with the  banks where the Relief Fund is deposited that it  can only be drawn on the regular Relief Fund warrants,  thus putting it out of the power of the officers to  use it for any purpose except to pay death and  disability benefits.  6    YELLOW FEVER.    This Order does not extend into the yellow  fever districts, as Councils are not allowed to be  organized in the States of Mississippi, Arkansas,  Alabama, Louisiana and Florida, and portions of  Tennessee and Georgia, in which that disease has  prevailed.    SUMMARY.    The Order of Chosen Friends combines the fol-  lowing substantial benefits and advantages:  1. Death benefits of from $500 to $3,000.  2. Disability benefits of from $250 to $1,500.  3. Old age benefits of from $500 to $3,000.  4. Sick benefits of $5 or more a week.  5. It admits males and females to member-  ship with equal privileges.  6. It secures more benefits for less money  than any other Order.  7. It is the great family Order of the country.  The family is the greatest institution in the  world, and an Order that incorporates that insti-  tution into itself is destined to become the strong-  est in the world.    CONCLUSION.    This Order offers the surest way to prevent the  household loaf from being buried with the house-  hold head. It helps to rid the community of  pauperism and of the crimes incident to poverty.  It brings relief to the sorrows of bereavement,  and brightens the pathway of the distressed. It  provides a property not exposed to the demands  of creditors, but protected by law for one's   beneficiary. It brings ready money just at that  moment when it is most timely and welcome.    To all who want more, or have no life or health  protection, the ORDER OF CHOSEN FRIENDS presents  the same better than can be obtained elsewhere.    If there is not a Council in your vicinity, help to  organize one. If there is a Council, join it.    For particulars address any Officer.  7

 To President Wilford Woodruff, and the Twelve Apostles.    Dear sir when I sent to you last winter for the priviledge and appointment, of teaching  the principles of the gospel contained in the New Testament, Book of Mormon, and Former  Commandments, you did not according to the conduct of your servant Sakes, think it worth  your while to even give a respectable answer to my request, but said that there was nothing  worth answering that he knew of. I would not at this ^time^ think that it would be worth while to write  any more to you, if I had not been reading your Epistle to the Church, for you appear so indepen-  dent, yea so much above your fellow man, that I should leave you go on to the end of your days,  but my soul is filled with sorrow, when I behold the miserable condition you and the people  are in. In your Epistle you give your testimony about what the prophet Joseph taught you and  the Twelve Apostles before his death, and the keys, endowments, blessings, and powers you received  from him, and that he appointed no one but the Twelve that should have authority to lead the  Church, and you are the last of that Twelve, that heared these things. It is now over forty 40 years  since that time and you are the last of that wasTwelve that was left by Joseph to lead the Church.  Even forty years is a long time to wait for that, that may be compared to a great river of corru-  ption and wickedness that did spring from the unbelief and carnal desires of the people  that are now nearly all passed away. The darkness of that unbelief was terrible to behold,   in it many of the sheep of the fold has been scattered to an fro, here and there, and almost every  where. Are you not satisfied with the past experience and misery of this people? Do you  want to continue this state of things, until those that are scattered will all perish, and  the riseing generation to dwindle away in unbelief, without a knowledge of God, like  an anchor to hold them, while the storms are beatting about them? I write to you this  time as the representative of the Church, because you stand now at the head of the highest

 Quorum in the Church. I did think that what I wrote to you before was plain enough  for almost any one to understand, but at this time, I shall try to write still plainer to you,   so that you ^may^ have a better understanding conserning the things that will come to pass.   I am sorry that the Chuch was in such a lamentable condition of unbelief, at the time you   testify that you and the Twelve got your endowments, keys, blessings, and powers, from  Joseph Smith the prophet. If you had been faithful to God as you should have been, instead of  receiveing your endowments from man, you could have a greater blessing from God, even   the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as they did on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem; you could   have the promise of the Savior made good to you, so well as them; See the last chapter of   Mark as follows: "And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they   cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they   drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they   shall recover." xx [##Mark 16:17-18##] "And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working   with them, and confirming the word with signs following." See also the teaching  of Paul the apostle in first Corinthians and 12th chapter on spiritual Gifts. [##I Corinthians 12##]  I call your attention to these things because you appear as if you had forgotten   them, in your great zeal to establish an other order of things in the Church. Through   your transgressions you have lost much of the powers of heaven, you have exchanged  the blessings of heaven for the things of the earth, instead of being spiritually minded,   you have become carnally minded, and have addopted a law of carnal com-  mandments, instead of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What has become of the spirit-  ual Gifts that was given by the God of heaven, with the Everlasting Gospel in the   beginning, when it was restored in its fullness to man on the earth? Did you and the   Twelve Apostles all agree and join together, to stop the Saints that had these gifts to  use them? If you did have a voice or vote to that effect, you are under condemnation.

 If you will read the last chapter in the Book of Mormon, you shall there see the last testi-  mony of Moroni as follows: "And wo unto them who shall do these things away and die,   for they die in their sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I speak   it according to the words of Christ, and I lie not." {##Moroni 10:26|Moroni 10:26##] He also says that he will meet all that has  or will do any such an evil deed at the bar of God, and then He (God) will ask you if  He did not warn you through this man (Moroni) against such a wicked deed. The Saints   had sacrifised all earthly pleasures, leaveing their homes and relations and endureing  insults, dishonor, and persecution, for the sake of secureing the favor and gifts of the Eternal   God, according to the promise of His Son, but to their grief and dissappointment when   they arrived among the mountains of Utah, instead of being encouraged in their   spiritual course of righteousness, their attention was called to a law of carnal com-  mandments doing away with that which was spiritual, even those things that was their   comfort, and consolation, that enabled them to endure all their aflictions, and tribulations,  even the grandest and greatest gifts of God to man, that they relied on in life, or in death,  in time, or in eternity, even the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Where was that love and sym-  pathy that you should have for your brothers and sisters, when you caused them   to stop useing the gifts of the gospel of Christ? The greatest comfort they had in the   world was taken from them at that time, the Gifts that enabled them to commune  with the Great Father and Son, through the Holy Ghost, the saints was hindered   from useing. What right do you suppose you had to change the sacred and eternal   order of the house or Church of God? Even stopping the Gifts of the Spirit of God,   the only means of salvation given through our Savior to mankiind. How many  hearts do you think you have caused to be broken, by trying to comply with your   order of things? Thousands of innocent, harmless, and good people, has come to   these mountains, for the purpose of doing God's will, and to gain a greater portion

Patent Office in 1886 to get it Patented. on  which I Claim a Patent because They have kept  Me Out of a Naumber of Millions of Dollars,  and Robbed The World of The Use, of This Invau-  luable Machine.

 1    Ogden 8/16 1897    To the Venerable Wilford Woodruff:  Beloved President    Please forgive the lib-  erty I take in thus writing to you, but  it ^is^ nothing but the agony I suffer that  would induce me to do so. Will be as brief  as the circumstances will admit of. I was  president of a Ward Primary Association  at the time the call was made for means  to complete our grand & noble Temple & I  found out my nerves were giving out under  the strain of that ^&^ with the cares of a large  family of small children & unable to afford  help. but my desire to keep up until  we had given entertainments enough to  donate a goodly portion to that cause   prevented me from resigning & the Sisters  with whom I was laboring felt like it  would be wrong to resign when weI had 
 Kalihiwai Kauai S. Islands  Feb. 7th 1855    Brother Woodruff    Dear Sir    In compliance with your  request, I will endeavor to improve the present opportunity  by writing a few lines to you. With a few slight exceptions  I have enjoyed good health since leaving the valley.  I presume you are aware of our delay at California, which  was occasioned by circumstances that we were unable to  control, therefore I believe it was all right. I landed at  Honolulu the 24th of December in company with Bros. Caine  and Johnson, being the last that arrived, of the Breathren  that were ^appointed^ to this mission, by the last April conference.  I stayed in Honolulu untill after the funeral of the old  King and the coronation of his successor, which took place  on the 10th & 11th of Jan. The funeral procession was a sple-  ndid affair and reflected much credit on the Kingdom.  As this Island had been designated as my future field of  labor, myself and Bro. Whitney (who was also appointed to  this Isdland) took the steamer on the 12th and arrived at this  Island the morning of the 13th & amediatly commenced the  task of learning the native language. Bros. R. A. Allred  and Molen are upon this Island. Bro. Molen has been here  about three months, he can talk some but has not a  sufficient knowledge of the language to preach much yet, but  is making rapid progress, the young Breathren generaly are  making are obtaining the language very readily, some of  them have commenced preaching. Judging from the length  of time that I have been here, Bro. Molen thinks I will get  the language pretty quick, but it is tedious for a person that  has not been accustomed to confine their mind to any one  thing. The Breathren that were here when the last lot  came, will all probably leave for home, after our July

 4  of spiritual power from Him who is Almightly, but to our sorrow instead of geting more  abundantly of the fruit of righteousness, even that portion we had was made inactive  or inoperative through your Order of things. The nurishment that is necessary for  a spiritual increase has been stopped, the result is a spiritual weakness causeing   many to be discouraged and fall by the way unheeded and unaided by many that  pass by. The young people among us have not been accustomed to see nor feel   the power of God manifested through the Gifts of the Spirit, the most of them depend on   the words of others, instead of getting a Knowledge for themselves from God. Hence the   urgent necessity of granting me and others that desire, the priviledge and right to   preach the fullness of the Gospel, as it was restored in its purity from God, to man in these   last days. I hope that the end of all that is dark corrupt and miserable is at hand, and   that the dawning of a brighter day will soon spread its glory over the world, when   the Gifts of the Holy Ghost which is the power of the Everlasting Gospel, will be   enjoyed by all those that believe in it.  There is thousands of honest people in these   mountains that would be willing and thankful to have the priviledge to live   according to the fullness of the Gospel, and would rejoice and give glory to God  in the hightest, if they had the gifts of the Holy Ghost according to the promise of   Jesus Christ. If you deem yourselves unworthy to receive the Gifts of the Holy Ghost,   according to the pattern given in the Holy scriptures, then you should step aside  to make room for them that have faith, that God can and will bring about a   restoreation, of all the gifts and powers that has been lost to you by transgression, but   secured to all that have faith in the unchangeable covenant of the Everlasting Gospel.   What do you suppose that furture generations will think of your conduct towards  me, in refuseing to give me a hearing, when I testify to you conserning the things that   has been revealed to me? If you do not repent, your condemnation will go forth 
 New York Dec 19th [18]49    Dr Brother Woodruff    according  to your request I will give you  my oppinion with regard to the best  route from Saint Louis to the Bluffs.  the route I would advise—is—that   by Montrose or Keokuck Iowa  from thence to Fort desmoines and  from thence to the Bluffs by way  of Pisgah or by the new route lately  laid out. My reasons—are these    1st. You will abvoid the difficult and   dangerous navigation of the Missouri   river    2nd You will ^be^ enabled to purchase your   waggons in Saint Louis—ship them up to   the above places—there fit them up for your  journey while at the same time a portion  of your company couldcan go out into   the Northern part of Illenoise or  into Missouri bordering on the   Missippi where oxen and cows  are much cheaper than at the Bluffs

So I con-  tinued until the following June when  the anniversary of Pres't Young's Birth-  day was to be celebrated by the children  & when those exercises were over, & a  short time after another child was  born to me I was a complete nervous  wreck & am yet; my brain troubling  me to such an extent I can scarcely  endure the children to speak to me  & when they worry me I feel like I  would go raving mad. The oldest one  is a boy of 12 yrs & I am obliged to  remain all day alone with them.   On account of my long seige of help-  lessness we are very much reduced  in circumstances & for that reason  it is very difficult to get help.    Have been administered to by the Elders

 conference. Bros. Johnson Karren & Lawson have gone.  I believe the work is prosperous on these Islands  generaly speaking, although the faith of the saints areis weak  in some places, they are a weak minded people and unless  continualy stired up will becom[e] slack and negligent.  at one branch where I stayed a couple of weeks, the Presiding  Elder and a number of the members threatened to leave  the Church in consequence of having to feed us, but there  are many good saints here, that are willing to do all  they can for the Elders, but after all the Elders have  a great many difficulties to encounter as the natives are  so poor it is almost impossible to get the means to defray  the expences of going to the different Islands, to attend conference  &c. But when a servent of God goes out in the world to procl-  aim the principles of  eternal life, they naturaly expect  to to see hard times. I fancy they do not expect the same kind  of fare that they receive at home in the valleys of the mou-  ntains, at least I did not, I expected to pass through some  pretty tight places, and ^to^ undergo hardships & suffer privations,  if I do not have to suffer anything but should receive my  pay as I go along of course I should not expect to be rewarded  hereafter, my prayer is continualy that the Lord will  streangthen me & enable me to be the instrument in his  hands of accomplishing some good in this Kingdom.  It appears to be a difficult task to better the condition of  this people in their present condition situation, surrounded  with the influences that dos surround them.    This is a splendid country and in the hands of an enterp-  rising people could no doubt be made very productive,  vegitation grows the year round, which gives the face of  the country a beautiful aspect.    While in California we heard a great deal about the anex-  ation of these Islands to the United States but after  we arrived here we did not hear much about it, and I 
 5    from generation to generation, so long as your history will be known among men.   But if you do repent and turn to the Lord, with all your heart, then you shall be ab-  undantly blessed, and rejoice in the way of salvation in your old age. I ask can it   be possible that you have willingly cast away the sweet influencies of the Gifts of the Spirit of   God, in exchange for those things which are caral, vain, sinful, and degrading in   their nature? How long will you strive to lock out of the Church, the wisdom and power of  God, to make room for the display of your carnal performances? I wonder that you have   been so much like the children of Israel anciently, their prophet Moses desired that they   should sanctify themselves, but they would not come up to that hight standard of perfec-  tion, so he gave them a law of carnal commandments. [##Exodus 34##] Has it not been so with you in  these days? Would you choose to appear before our Savior as the advocate and defen-  der of a law of carnal commandments instead of being an advocate and defender of   the Gospel of Jesus Christ?  If so, then I ask you where is that substancial manhood, and  independence of character, that should adorn every one that will have the honor, of being   called valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ? Have you been so high minded as to over-  look the above priceless stamp of human character? I look with admiration upon the  manhood and independence of character manifested in the life of our Savior, and others   I could name; but a perverted manhood and independence, I despise. I ask what can   be the reason that it appears by your condict, that you can not afford the time, to write or   speak to your fellow man, when you think him below your rank of honor? Where did   you find such an example of perverted aristocratic pride, in the Gospel of Christ?   We have such as the above example, given by them of old, who persecuted and killed   the prophets, and them that God had sent to them. Would you also follow after them?   I have never refused to speak or reason, on the fair and grand platform of equality,   with any of my fellow men, be they high or low; in the esteemation of other men. If we

It is for the sake of my children  that I pour out the anguish of my  soul to you, not being able to go to  meetings with them & their father has  to work every day Sundays & holidays  too they are running wild.    Although this nervous trouble has been  coming on for years, one of the  Bishops here says it is the adversary  that is troubling me & I do not un-  derstand how that could be when  I have tried in every way to do  right & have never shrank from a  duty in the Church but have gone  under very trying circumstances  when I & my children have been  sick
