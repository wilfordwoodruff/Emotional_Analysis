 When in the course of human events have we ever witnessed a more interesting society of mortals than is here presented to our view it is the glorious motives that caused the assembly of those patriots that endowed its scene with such interest here before us is the portrait of our fore fathers and with the thoughts of tyranny & oppresssion chilled the blood in their veins & rights & liberty ocipyied a seat in their hearts & vibrated their assembly so powerfully that that they all of one heart & one mind like a band of brothers with an eager hand stretched grasp'd their pen & enrolled their names on a list which at this [maybe the] same time they were not insensible that if they they should be defeated they were signing their death warrant but this company of men were not destitute of deep forethought & sensibility they were men that highly prized the privileges liberty & happiness of America & their [maybe these or those or perhaps they're] ancestors with one accord trusting to the protecttion of Allmighty God pledged their fortunes liberties & lives to maintain the liberties which we now enjoy & by the help of God they suceed[e]d in their understanding & to the astonishment of the world accomplished the emancipation of America this company of enterprising men accomplished some of the greatest deedes that ever was recorded considering what they had to encounter inexperiance had to contend with dissapline [discipline] poverty [two words unintelligible] loss of charters one abridgement of liberty after another still indulging the feelings & adopting the languag of Affection untill [unintelligible word]  & religion bid them rise & they did and arise and secure to America those rights & privledges which the God of nature designed for all his rational offsprings but whare now are those noble men that turned the wheels of American independance we hope & trust their names are enrolled on that golden list of everlasting life & their immortal spirits in that society whare glory will never tarnish but will grow brighter & brighter long after after the spheers of nature stand still.	by a well wisher to liberty & freedom 
 while meditating uppon the glorious deeds performed by our forefathers we do not pretend to advance the argument that they were performed without the assistance of higher power. [illegible] as the amancipation of America has been accomplished no one of decided virtue will but admit that it was perfected by the hand of of a over ruling Providence who of us can [illegible] the imaginary idea but that the small monster[?] of europeans would not have been crushed by the wanton savages or driven like chaff before the wind by the disciplined armies that were conscripted to this continent for the sole purpose of subduing of the univers therefore let us live with a realizing sens of the privledges & blessings which we share & while we are partaking of these gifts may our harts be raised in thanksgiving to God that he has seen fit to give us a birth in such an enlightened part of the globe & may our time be so spent & our talents so improved that whare [or when] [two illegible words] done with life & sense & mortal puts on immortality that we may have a happy entrance in to courts of that being who ocupies a more elevated station than mankind[written vertically in right margin] Willford 1831 [eleven similar flourishes, one in left margin and ten on bottom of the page] 
 My dear Brother,I have but little spare time.But I will appropriate these first few momentswhich I have been able ^to^ catch from my num-erous calls—to answer your very interestingquestions? Let me say to you I am glad youtook the liberty to propose them. I shall al-ways be ready to listen to any similar re-quests. But I hasten to my bussiness.Your first question respects the Sabbath& its change.God having finished his work of Creation in sixdays, ceased or rested therefrom on the seventh,& set it apart for the more solemn worship of himself by men, & as an emblem & pledge of their eternalblessedness. ##Genesis 2:1-2|Gen II 1.2.##The ancient Patriarchs observed the Sabbath, thoughwe have no particular account of it.The "End of days," when Cain & Abel offered theiroblations, & The day when the sons of God met togetherin Job's time, doubtless were Sabbath days. ##Genesis 4:3-7|Gen. IV.## ##Job 1:6|Job I.6##& ##Job 2:1|II.1.##When Gods ancient people were fed with manna from Heaven, in the wilderness, they were told that a doubleportion would fall on the day previous to the Sabbathwhich should be gathered & that none should be gatheredon the sabbath for the Sabbath was the LORDs. ##Exodus 16:23|Exodus. 16.23## 
 Lines on the deathof an InfantHow short is life! Tis but a transient glow,That's often dim'd by sublunary woe:—So short is life— So feeble is its beam,It scarcely glimmers ere its end is seen!We've seen the Aged 'neath a weight of years,Resign their breath, and leave this vale of tears—We've seen amidst their glory and their prime,Dear friends, remov'd from all the scenes of time—We've seen the Youth both beautiful and gay,By sickness seiz'd, and borne by death awayWe've seen sweet Babes their tender eyelids close,Forget to weep—and sink in still repose:Cecilia too,— Dear Babe!— Her journey's o'er!She breath'd—she wept;— but she shall weep no more.How short her time by providence assign'd!But fourteen days she was on earth confin'd !Angelic bands her spirit did convey,To happier realms in everlasting day:Though latest born, she's first ariv'd at home,To see the splendor of the eternal throne.Like some fair plant to chilling winds expos'd,(Before the tender bud its leaves disclos'd)Which pluck'd by gentle hands, was borne away,To some fair clime to bloom in bright array, 
 Thus it appears that the Sabbath was most sacredly re-garded, before the moral law was given from Sinai.But to mark the perpetual & universal obligationsof the observance of the Sabbath, God proclaimed thelaw of it from Sinais wrote it in a table of stone,a long with the rest which are allowed to be moral,##Exodus 20:8-11|Exodus XX 8-11##. Injunctions to keep it & threatenings forthe breach of it, are every where found in the law & the prophets.The Sabbath is therefore of universal obligation—How is it changed from the seventh to the first dayof the week?In answering this question I would observeI. Man's moral obligation respects the seventh partof his time, rather than any particular day. It is not certain that the Godly before the flood, keptthe same day which they kept after that event.Now it is certain that the same cronology was obser-ved at the giving of the law at Sinia, which hadbeen observed before & after the flood.But however cronology might alter, a seventh-part of the time would be the same in all ages.II To honour his own ressurrection, Jesus the LORDof the Sabbath, changed the Sabbath from theseventh to the First day of the week.To mark the devine authority of this change,he on that day, made repeated visits to his de-ciples—##John 20:19-26|John XX. 19.26##. On that day he bestowed the miraculous gifts & graces of the Holy Ghost. ##Acts 2|Acts II.1##. 
 The pastto the reflecting mind nothing is at once more instructive and interesting than a reviewof the past. Who is this that has looked back on ages that are past and tracedempires and republicks through the various stages of their prosperity and decline, thathas trod amid the mouldering ruins of cities which were once grand and magnificentthat has reposed within the walls of palaces which were once the sects of luxury and festivitybut now deserted and forsaken but has turned his thoughts within uppon himself and beenconvinced of his own insignificance and the mutability of all that is humanin the course of nature nations have arisen flourished and fallen the monumentsof kings the triumphal arches of conquerors and heroes have crumbled. Time in hisravages has been as unyielding as Death and as insatiable as the grave in his rapidflight he has dashed in ruins the strongest on the most beautiful fabricks that humaningenuity could devise or human art construct he has but glanced at thepride the pomp the pageantry of man & they have faded in oblivion. Man beingmortal himself how can he expect to confer immortality on his workshimself the vain & transitory being of a moment how can he expect thatstability to will be inherent in his actions. It is true he can clime the steepand rugged hill of fame and uppon its towering summit light the fire ofhis renown which will for ages burn a beacon to the univers he canwear some stupendous fabrick & theire inscribe his name which will for centuriesstand a momento of his greatness but he cannot protect his trophies for onthe destroying hand of time or for a moment notand the all powerful armof death Time sweeps by with resistless force and man & his works areborne away on his troubled waves to the shoreless ocean of eternity.In this light how dimly shines the pomp and pagentry of earth, howuseless & unavailing the contentions of the great & powerful ware manto review the past with calmness & reflection & imprint the truthsit unfolds uppon the mind convinced of the futility of allsublemary things he would rase his thoughts from the xpandingthings of earth & place them on a brighter & better worldFull of the hopes of heaven avarice would unlock her hoarded gold& extend his hand to brighteyed clarity. Ambition leaving his idolizeddreams would cease to deluge countries with the blood of his fellow beings& study to alleviate their sufferings, luxury forsaking his revels & hisbanquets would shed the tear of pity over the woes & miseries of the hungry& destitute & in fine the primeval scenes of felicity would again be restored& man would again be repose beneath the blissful shades of thetrees of Paradise[sideways text] Willford 1832 [end of sideways text]

 [page torn] she, thrice happy Babe By hands Divine,Was rais'd to bloom in a more healthful clime,Where sin does ne'er appear, nor grief, nor pain;But peace and joy uninterupted reign:Remote from ills, secure from earthly woe,Where chilling blasts are never to blow.Cecilia! Lovely Babe!— Her infant frameNo more shall feel the smart of mortal pain.She only sleeps!— Tho' motionless she lies,Her sacred dust, refin'd, again shall rise,To shine in bliss most exquistitely bright, Surpassing far the sun's refulgent light.And is she dead? O no! She enter'd lifeThe moment she escape'd this world of strife:For here by tegious tedious flight the mind aspires,And thro' the sense all its skill acquires;And waits imprison'd, till by slow degrees,The organs strengthen, and the spirit sees,Or feels (by means of sense) the things around,Or harks, delighted, to the pleasing sound.But now from earth remov'd, her soul expands,And by the throne in holy rapture stands;Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streams,And basks delighted, in unsully'd beams;Now hears with wonder the melodious strain,And joins to celebrate Messiah's name;Her mind illumin'd, now with glad surprise,Sees happier worlds, unseen by mortal eyes.

 convincing & overwhelming.II If we should exercise strong faith in God, andlive at the fountain head of holy influencethat is—should we watch unto prayer, andpray without ceasing—should we daily fearto sin & daily deny ourselves & take up ourcross & follow christ—should all professorsof religion persue this course—doubtless awonderfull change would be effected atonce in the state of the church, but evenin that case I do not see that the churchwould have any authority to attemptto perform such miracles, as were performedin the apostolic age.They doubtless would shed their holyinfluence all around & be instrumen-tal in the conversion of thousands of souls,& the glorious Gospel would be spedilybe preached to all who dwell upon theearth.

 Brother W. Woo^d^ruff.Sir, your Letter of the 9th. of March, directed to Bishop Partridge, Presidents Joseph Smith Jr., SidneyRigdon, ^and^ Hyram Smith, and the saints in Zion, came safely tothem, some days since. And on account of the press of businessnow on their hands, ^and the request of J Smith Jr.,^ I have taken it upon me to answer it.You say that you have heard of the deplorable state of things inKirtland; and it gave me much Joy to learn by your letter, thatyou viewed those things in their true light. Great has been theafflictions of the saints in that place, particularly our belovedBrotheren Joseph Smith Jr., and S. Rigdon.In the lastsummer, I Journeyed from this place in company with WmSmith, and D. W. Patten, to Kirtland, for the purpose ofmeeting in Conference those with the 12 ^twelve^. On our arrival,we soon learned the difeculties that then existed there: thesehowever ware all appearantly settled, preveiously to my leavingKirtland: And^W^ Parish, who has since become [4 illegible words] ^an unbeliever in the bookof Mormon^ [1 illegible word] ^revealed religion,^ affected to repent and become sattisfied, with Br. Josephand the Church. Others also did the same; But this settlementwas not of long duration. Soon after this, President HyramSmith and J. left Kirtland for the upper Missouri: andPresident Joseph Smith, President S. Rigdon, and ^Prest.^ Wm.Smith, soon followed us to Far West: and during theirabsence, it seemes that ^Wm. Parish, J.

 George Phippin's answer toWillford WoodruffJan 7th 1837 
 How blind and infatuated are the minds of men, when once turned fromRighteousness to wickedness. They did not understand, that by takingupon them the name of Latter day Saints, did not do away that of theChurch of Christ. Neither did they consider, that the ancient church,was the Church of Christ, and that they were Saints. And again,it appears that they did not consider the Prophesy, of Daniel, which ^says^ saith; "The saints shall take the Kingom" &c "Again, "the Kingdom, andthe greatness of the Kingdom, under the whole Heaven, was given tothe people, (the Saints) of the most High" &c And the Saintshere alluded to, were certainly Latter day Saints; was much, as theabove prophesy is to be fulfilled, in the Last days; and is yetfuture, as all professed readers of the bible will confess.We have of late learned, that Parish, and the waste of this [2 illegible words] ^combination^,have openly renounced the Book of Mormon, and beome deists—I will now Leave Kirtland, and give you some acount of the movement of things here, as they are and have been.I am, [as to?] [1 illegible word], well remember the visit, which I, in company withElder Groves, made to the Churches in Kentucky and Tennessee, inthe summer of 1836. You also may recollect, the nature andresult, of our visit. We came to solisit assistance, for Poorbleeding Zion: And we obtained, through the goodnes of theChildren of God, in those regeons, the sum of fourteen hundredand fifty dollars, which we delivered unto Wm. Phelps & JohnWhitmer on our arrival to this place. But these men, insteadof laying out the money for the benefit of Poor bleedingZion, purchased Land for their own instrument. They g^e^nerallydid their business, independantly of the aid, or council of ^within^ the bishopor High Council. This gave some uneasiness to the 2 ^two^ authorities of zion: not only because they purchased land WithChurch funds, in their own name, for their own agrandisement,but because they selected the place of the City Far Westand appointed the spot for the House of the Lord to bebuilt on, drew the plan of said house, and appointed andordained a committee to build the same, withoutasking of seeking council, at the hand of either Bishop,High Council, or first presidency; when it was well understood that these authorities were ^appointed^ for the purpose of counciling on all imporant matters pertaining to the saints ofGod. These two presidents also managed to get the town plattinto their own hands, that they that they might reap the availsarising from the sale of the lots. In consequence of these, withmany other things, the Council met by themselves on the 3d. day ofApril 1837, and resolved to invite the two presidents, the Bishopand his council, and the two apostles, namely T. B. Marsh and D. W.Pattatten, to meet with them, on the 5th. inst. to which time theyadjourned. Acordingly the above named authorities met, on the 
 5th., and after lbouring dilegently three days in succession, it was unanimously agreed upon, that the town Plat, with 4 ^four,^ eighties adjacentto the platt, should be at the disposal of the Bishop and his councilthe High Council, the two presidents, and the two apostles.During this labour the two presidents acknoledged they were wrong, and theyto all appearances wittingly suffered themselves to be the corrected by the Council.In the begining of May following, the Council again met, and resolvedto have the above mamed ^named^ property transfered into the hands ofthe bishop, as an equivalent to the Poor bleeding zion money, andthat the avails of said land, should be thereafter applied to the benefitof the poor, and other publick purposes. The business of the transferof said property, was transacted by the two presidents, the Bishop and his council, and by some means they managed to bind the bishop in a hearingmortgage ^of three thousand four hundred and fifty dollars^ to apply two thousand dollars of the avails of the town plat ^which they had [1 illegible word]^ tothe building at the House of worship, which they intended to build ^have^ erectedSince that time, the affair of building the house has falen through.Consequntly, many people have withdrawn ther subscription toit, and these two men, claiming this two thousand dollars as theirsubscription, chose to withdraw it, and put it into their own pocketsa small part of which has been already paid to Wm. W.

After which, charges were prefered against thembefore the Council, which were substantiated, and they wereexcommunicated.

 P. S. Since Br. Joseph Came to this place, we have been favored with a lengthyrevelation in which many important items are shown forth. First. that theChurch, shall hereafter be Called "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints" Second it saith ^says^ "Let the City Far West be a holy and aconsecrated land unto me, and it shall be called most holy, for the groundupon which thou standest is holy: Therefore, I command you to build a houseunto me, for the geathering togeather of my Saints, that they may worship me" &cIt also teaches, that the foundation or corner stone must be laid on the 4th.of July nex, and that a commencement must be made in this following season,and in one year from the 26th. of April last, the foundation must beagain commenced, and from that time, to continue the worke untillit is finished. Thus we see that the Lord is more wise than men, forPhelps & Whitmer thought to commence it long before this, but it wasnot the Lords time, therefore, he overthrew it and his appointed his own time. The plan is yet to be shown to the first presidency, and all thesaints, in all the world are commanded to assist in building the houseThomas B.

 Montrose Lee County Sept. 1st 1840My Dear WilfordI sit down this morn. to acknowledge the reception of your letter bearing date of June 3th & after sending many times to the officefor a letter the day before yesterday I was persented with a letter from you brought by some of the brethren from Eng. as I learned that 4 family arrived in Commerce the 27of this Aug. I have not seen any of them or learned any of their names ^yet^ and report says that there are 30 families more in Cincinata Ohio, on their way to Commerce. I was truly glad to hear from you of your health and the prosperity of the work with you—your last letter before this came to hand the middle of June dated April 24 you say you sent me 4 letters since you arrive in Eng. I have received them alland have sent you 6 before this am verry sorry you have not received more of them particularly my Jan. one in that I spare you a more particular acc--ount of my situation and how things were with and around me and I commenced this morn with a determination to tell you something more but what shall I say I am almost inclined to pass over the past but as if I cannot tell my dear Willford about my troubles who can I tell while those around you me say I dont write anything to make him uneasey but I willgive you a brief sketch of the situation of things with me who since you leftme. — For 2 week after you left me I ejoyed quite good health then was taken withthe fever and ague in a few days I was moved that is my bed and some other thingsout to brother Smoots where I had ^the best^ attention the house could afford although it hadno floor in it or door or window—I was sick with the chills about 3 months and little Sarah was verry sick to for days together I was not able to sit up to have my bed made. I was reduced so low I remained there 8 or 9 weeks and sister Smoot was taken sick my house was not done and it was with theutmost exertion that I could get any thing done to it if sister Taylor had not moved into my room with sister Pratt in Montrose I thought of going there but I did not blame her in the least about it I think she could not help it as she was situated—about the forepart of Nov. they called it done it had no door or window or loft in it the roof verry poorly laid on so that the snow and rain came in verry plentifully the snow would be a number of inches deep and mostly over the floor thus was my house finished when I moved into it and I had the chill and fever then and could not sit up only apart of the time and Sarah was unwell to I had a young girl with me 2 weeks then she left me and then I had to do as I could with little Sarah cow and all I did not sit up all day thong but got much slandered for haveing that girl so long

Woodruffhas faithfuly laboured amoung us in all humility and meekness; and that we feel gratefull to the Lord for his goodness, in sending him among us.

 my house was exceeding cold with much of the daubing out of it and I was muchtroubled for wood I suffered much with my dear little Sarah for want of woodbrother Avery in this neighbourhood was appointed bishop and when I asked himfor any thing he was cross and would complain, so one day when my floor was covered with snow and I had not one stick of wood or more fire than could be put into a pint cup nor had I had any for about one week accept some little sticks the children had picked up for me. I was sitting close in one corner with a shawl on and my child under it to keep her from the snowwhich then came in on us and the weather was severe cold brother PeslyClark called to see me and saw my situation he went home and told his father and he sent for me immediately to come and make it my home athis house and made me as welcome as my fathers house he took my cow and calf and kept them through through the winter—the people in Loovely street was tired with me for not selling my calf some of them talked of making me sell my clothes to provide for myself—but I trust those days are over and they are kind to me here their family is large and I thought you would certainly be home this fall but I am now fearful of it father Clark still tells me to stay there untill you come home. My health grew better soon after I went there and the most of the time I was comfortable through the wintersat up most of the time—On the 22 of march my babe was born for 2 weeks I was comfortable then was taken with the chills which lasted me untill Junein the time my babe was verry sick and had the hooping cough and seamed near dying he has since that had 2 verry sick turns and is verry low now I think it verry uncertain whether you ever see him in this world or notof the 16th of July our little darling Sarah was taken sick and died on the 17 as I have told you the particulars in a letter sent by L. Snow—sinceJune my health has been quite good—before little Sarah's death I felt quite reconciled to your absence although I have had almost one continued scene of trouble since you left me—but since her death I cannot feal reconciled to my situation I feell far more lonely than I have at all particularly now my babe is so sick I have to bear my trouble alone no Willford or relative to sympathise with me and can you tell me my dear companion who has a better ^right to^ share to a part of your attention and kindnes than your best friendyour absence renders me miserable indeed since last July had you been at home I think our dear child might have been living but I forbear for this is a heart rending subject to dwell upon. I must say that I want you to come home exceedingly this fall if you do not know of a certainty thatthe Lord requires you to be there if so I suppose I must submit to it and if I live, live through another cold lonely winter. Yes my heart sinks within me when I think of spending my life mostly alone but I me intend to go with you some times

And as your papers have been brought here & I am now about to take charge of them I wish an understanding with you upon the subject All that I have written to you heretofore upon that subject I have said according to the statements made to me by Elders Hedlock & Ward I know nothing about it more than what they have said. In a letter I got from Nauvoo I was informed that some one told you fromScotland that if he had known they were in this country he could have sold them all. I dont know who the person wasbut who ever he might be I think he was mistake in that. I do not know how great a little exertion the Brethren have made here to sell them but they advertised them several timesin the Star & Elder Hedlock says that in his travels throughEngland & Scotland in all his conference, He spoke of themThe Stars speak for thousands upon that subject. But I will here say since I have come their is not a Book in England I have taken more pains to try to sell than the Times & Seasons[written in sideways text] Coppy of a letter To Elder J TaylorNauvoo Aug 1st1845 [end of sideways text]

I have not yet been able to getthe drawing paper & penscils for sister Smith I may obtainsome hereafter if so I will forward it to you In fact I have been overwhelmed in business of one knid & another sothat I have not had time to attend to such things as I would have liked. As to News in this Country I would ownly say that the work is on the increase through most allthe conferences & Churches. I attended a conference lastSunday at preston their had been 45 Baptized during the last 3 months I thatought that was well considering it was the old tramping ground Elder Hardy has been presidingthere but must now go home I appointed a presidingElder over the preston Chuch & another over the conference 
 see my address to the Churches in the land Vol 5 No 9also Vol VI No 3. & in all my travels since I have been herein conferences & councils I have urged the sail of that work the sail of it does not interfere with any Books in this land I Brought about one dozens of the IV Vol Bound some I gave tosome of my American Elders & what I sold I sold of 8/the Brethren thought that if they were bound & sold for6/ shillings that they would readily be disposed of But I have told them that will not do it will neither satisfy you nor pay the cost, but I have concluded tnot to bind them at all, but do all in my power to sell them as they are at 8/ per volume that is about the same as $2 per VolI am confident they will not fetch more than that & if you can get that it is better for than for them to lie on the shelves here for years I am starting some churches whare are laying by a little eachweek so when they get 8 shillings they will take one I will do any thing I can cheerfully upon this subject & I will not charge anything for my trouble, & Ias I am about to take them into my own hands I have been to the trouble of counting each Number of the 4th & 5 volume all over reportso that I know what I do reveal of them the duty on them is 6/ per pound & some other expenses of cartage &c Elder Hedlock said that you have required the duty & all expense to be added to $2 per vol he says it will amount to near 9/ per vol& that this is the reason why no more could be sold.

 Lines on the death of Sarah Emma WoodruffHow short is life! Tis but a transient glow,Thats's often dim'd by sublunary woe—So short is life—So feeble is its beam, It scarcely glimmers ere its end is seen!We'ere ^we've^ seen the Aged 'neath a weight of years,Resign their breath, and leave this vale of tears—We've seen amidst their glory and their prime,Dear friends, remov'ed from all the scene of time—We've seen the youth both beautiful and gay,By sickness seiz'd, and borne by death away,—We've seen sweet Babes their tender eylids close,Forget to weep—and sink in still repose:Yes Sarah to—Dear Babe!—Her journey's o've o'reShe breath'd—she wept—but she shall weep no more.How short her time by providence assigned!About two years she was on earth confined!Angelic bands her spirit did convey, To happier [realities] in everlasting day:Our babe has first arrived at home,To see the splendor of the eternal throne.Like some fair plant to chillings winds expos'd.(Before the tender bud its leaves disclos'd)Whhich pluck'd by gentle hands, was borne away,To some fair clime to bloom in bright array, 
 I forwarded according to your request your remarks to WmMiller on the £5 on land that you spoke of. Concerning the Bell for the Temple I will to say that I will do all in my power upon that ^subject^ I have made an appeal to all the Elders throughthe Star, & also made diligent Enquiry concerning the praice ofthe Bell & Duties on the same & we have also concluded to try to furnish a clock as well as a Bell if it will be aagreeable. We will endeavor to furnish means to pay for bothas soon as possible but now the question arises whether wethese things canot be furnished to much better advantage in America than in England for the Duties are vary high they are 30 per cent I can get a Brass Bell 2000 lbs weightfor about £140 about $600 dollars the duties on that in theUnited State a landing would be about £42 pounds or $204, this yousee is a heavy amount for Duty, the whole would be £182, or—$about $800. We can the price of an Iron Bell would be about£20 $100 but I have no Idea that the Lord wants an Iron Bell. As to a clock as to the price of a clock it would depend upon what kind of one it was, whether it should have one face or four whether lighted or dark some have thought that one of the first quality would cost £100 or $500 but as you said nothing about a clock I dont know whether you think of having one or not, or whether you have made arangements for one els whare. Now Br Young I wish you would ascertain what a Bell can be obtained for in the United States & if by purchasingit there the duty can be secured so much the Better as it will save $200 if the Bell can be purchased there we will forward 
 out of the preston Saints. We need American Eldersvary much to assist us in this land. I shalllook for some as soon as they get their EndowmentIf I can strike hands with one true & faithfulman who has his Endowment in this land I willthink the Lord. Elders M Holmes & L Hardy are the ownlyAmericans that are going home now the others I shallhold on to untill I get some more help, thework is generally much better than I could expectconsidering the few labourers in the Country. Ioneor two Rigdonites has been through this countryof late trying to esstablish Rigdonism but every place as yet they have visited they have goneout of it as soon as they went in their carehas been so prompty attended to by all Elders theyhave met that they consider their pilgramage a handare getting weak in their faith & begin to deny theirown calling at least are trying to palm themselfesoff as Saints if others do not faire any betterthan those that have come it will not pay themfor their trouble the truth is Rigdonism will find hard work to ever find a foot hold in thisland the Judgments of God are still in the Earth inthe Easten world a dreadful whirlwind has desolated aspot in fFrance of late many lives & much propertywas lost.

 one of which I give to the Treasuer of each Branch or to eachperson that sends a donation to me if not through the book ofthe treasurer I also keep a duplicate of the same whichremains in the Book, Besids this all the names is takendown in another Book with the sum each has given & as much of it is penny & happing subscription it makesmuch writing then we have to draw a copy of the sameto send to the Trustees in Nauvoo each 3 or 6 monthsas the case may be it is a vary safe but laboriousway of doing business I have been stiring themup of late on the Clock & Bell & am in hopes theywill be rather more liberal than they have beenfor I do not think they have been as forward in allrespects in this county in the tithing as in Americathough I realized they are tithed & taxed & taxed &tithed from many others sourses than from the Lord or his Saints, & then again they do not realize the importanceas fully as they do in America as the Elders that are overthe most of the Conferences & Branches do not feel as we dowe have but few labourers in the field here at the prestenttime that understand it properly we have but about half adozen Americans in these whole dominions we want menwho have recieved their Endowment. I have not been ableas yet to travel a great deal among the churches whareverI have been I have strirred them up upon these subjetsI have often thought I wished I had Elder Clayton withme to assist in business matters as well as preachingI recieved your request in a letter a long time sinceto send you a peace of linen & a Black Lace veil 
 Elder Ward has sold the Stars Bound for 3/6 & 4/ the cvenants Bound are sold for 3/6 & all publications are cheeper in England than in America & when they come to see 9/ charge for the Times & Seasons ^unbound^ it frightens them & as you allow for sale evry 10th Vol to agents I have thought if you would allow them to be sold for 8/ I would throw in my own trouble & try to get agents that sell in the conferences & churches ^to^ do the same which would mostly make up the loss. I wish you to informe me as soon as you get this after considering all thesethings what you are willing to do whether you are willingto have them sold at 8/ or not  if you require 9/ per Volfor them I think it will take many years to dispose of them for they have now been here over two years & ownly £ 3,3,0 worth have been sold while the expenses & Duty has been £ with the £ 5, sent you £22,13,9. If it was my care property I would far prefer to sell them at 8/or even some less than to have them lie on hand as they probably would at 9/ but when you come to considerall these things if you say hold on to them at 9/ I will do so. I will do by them as well as I would if they were my own. I hope Br Taylor will not think that I am wishing to dictate him concerning his propertyBut I have done as I would wish to be done by in making these statements.

As to News in this countryI will say as a general thing we are prospering inevry part of the vineyard before what we could expect consideringthe Extent of the field & the few Experienced Elders that are in it there are still some few Conferences yet that are some out of order & behind the time but in all such cases it is for the want of a change of officers to preside over the conferences but we have no time for a Elders on hand to make the change with fo[u]r out of Eleven thousand Saints Scattered over such a vast field we have ownly about six American Elders to supply the whole with except 2 or 3 of us in Liverpool & nearly all that are here else expecting soon to leave for America to be in Nauvoo in the Springand if we can hold our own untill we get 50 or 100 good wise Judicious men next spring after the Endowment to our help we shall do well.

 Ah! she, thrice happy Babe,—By hands Divine, Was raised to bloom in a more healthful clime,Where sin does ne'er appear, nor grief, p nor pain,But peace and joy uninterupted reign:Remote from ill, secure from earthly woe,Where chilling blasts are never known to blow.Yes Sarah Lovely Babe! Her infant frameNo more shall feel the smart of mortal pain.She only sleeps! Though motionless she lies,Her sacred dust, refin'd, again shall riseTo shine in bliss most exquisitly bright,Surpassing far the sun's refulgent light.And is she dead? O no! She enter'd life The moment she escaped this world of strife:For here by tedious flight tehe mind aspires,And though, the senses all its skill acquires;And waits imprisoned 'till by slow degrees,The organs strengthen, and the spirit sees,O feels (by meanes of sense) the things around,O harks, delightd delight'd, to the pleasing sound,But now from earth removed; her soul expands, And by the throne in holy rapture stands;Expanding still, she drinks the blissful streames,And basks delighted, in unsully'd beames;Now hears with wonder the melodious strain,And joins to celebrate Messiahss name;Her mind illumin'd now with glad surprise,Sees happier worlds, unseen by mortal eyes,

One Rigdonite Missionary has made his arival & we understand others are followingI have not yet been able to get the name of the one that has come, he has been careful to keep away from me, his stay in Liverpool was of vary short durationfor though he tried hard but he said he could do no good He went to Manchester Conference & he met with equalpoor success he has now gone to Ireland & if those that follow him do not have better success they will not get pay for their trouble for the Saints in this land have nothing to do with Sidney Rigdon orhis followers for they are strangers. We are pretty well prepared for any Rigdonites that may visit this countrythe bars we will put up. While I was in London Elder Hyde sent a letter to Elder Ward to put his address before the High priest quorum & send him the prophets for he was poor, so I found his pamphlet in print on my return to Liverpool 1500 copies, so thes pamphlets will be circulated abroadamong the chuches which will help block up Rigdonism.we were Blessed with a fine son aon the 18th of Aug July I Blessed him on the 8th day & call him Joseph myself & family are all well.

 it would be be well to take good care of them & not dispose of them as they will make full volumeswith what we have here. I have been looking for Elder Fielding for a long for a long time & expected the remainder of the 5th Vol commencing with the 19thNo as we have the 18th here. I have not thought properto break the 5th vol or sell a part of it untill the whole arived, but I think I have said quite sufficient upon this subject. I have no doubt but that you are quite busy but still I hope you will steal time enough to duly consider this subject & give me an answer. As to news in this county I will merely touch upon a few items. the 18 of July brought us a fineSon. I blessed him on the 8th day, his name is Joseph. FatherMother, Son & Daughters all well.

 [sideways text] Orson Hyde Dec 29 1860 [end of sideways text]Hon. W. Woodruff, Moroni Sanpete Co U TDear Brother, Dec 29, 1860I owe you manyapologies for not earlier answering your kindletter of the 20th Ult.ins I have written to myfamily in the city but once since I left, andhave seen my wife in Sanpete but about threetimes since the President was here. I have been very busy in building me a house and inpreaching the gospel. Away from home I seldomcould find a decent pen, or a half sheet of cleanpaper. I have written a little through necessityand a very little only. I might urge many otherreasons for not writing sooner, but none for wantof a disposition to write. I have not had timeeven to write a love letter, however strong my in-clinations may have been to do so. I never labored with body and mind more intently in my lifethan during the past season. I Am now reducedto the size of a decent man. But my house isso far finished that my goods are pitched intoit, and have left my family to regulate forthemselves while I go to Fillmore where I expect to be on New Years night. I am nowon my way there.Accept my thanks for your Kindattention to my vineyard. It was a swamp 
 Please read the remainder of this communication to thyselfPresident YoungI consider that a sens of duty requiresme to lay before you certain things which have beena source of much greif & sorrow to me since my arivalin England. sSome of the reasons why I have not before openedmy mind to you upon the subject has been that Ihave not wished to trouble your mind with anything that I could get along without, & it has been muchagainst my will to find fault with my Brother & lastlyI have lived in hopes of arranging all matters in anamicable manner without without calling your attentionto the subject at all. But I have at last come to theconclusion that you ought to know all. You will thenunderstand my position & know how to remember me beforethe Lord and perhaps you may be sumwhat surprised at what I am about to reveal to you At the death of Joseph you are well aware their was a strugling for power amongcertain men in America ^have^ you have felt the wait of this truth, in Zion So have I in Liverpool among men fromwhom I looked for better things viz R Hedlock & T WardTheir has been one Evil in this church from the Begining give mena little extra power & influence for a season when it is calledfor they are not willing to give it up or fill their own place &sustain men in theirs at least I have found it so hereI will now give you a statement of facts as near as Ican in truth since my arival in Liverpool. When I firstlanded I discovered a coldness & distance on the part of Elder Hedlocktowards me but much more to towards Br Clark afterspending a few days in getting settled I began to make inquiry into the affairs of the office Br Hedlock said the account Bookswere there I could Examine them. the Books not being keptin a Systematical order I could not readily comprehend things

 I soon saw evry exhertion was making to prejudice my mindagainst Br Clark the spirit against him was of such a Nature that I saw he could never work with Br Hedlockin fact the accusations against him was of such a Nature& urged so [warningly] I was obliged to make it almost myfirst business to trace up the the accusations against himto the fountain head through all its windings it appearedto me to be like great groanings among the mountains to to bring forth a mouse, it Ended in this fact he hadkissed somebody but in my opinion it was more to keephim out of the Emigration business thus to clense thechurch of crime. After I settled that up I advised himto take charge of some conference for a season untilltheir was a better feeling at Liverpool. I made my Address to the churches though the Star & had my recommendpublished with it that the Saints might know that Icame with Authority from Head the proper Source I saw that Br Hedlok & Ward seemed to he much troubledabout their standing so I made choice of them for councillorsout of respect to the men & their former standing, thinkingthey would operate with me, their was nothing through the Star but what all was right but the more I advanced towardmy place as president to take charge of things & direct themthe more I found a spirit against it & secretiveness inall things Esspecially with Br Hedlock & Br Ward had so muchof John Bull in him that it seemed at times that it was ofmore consequence to him than the priesthood, & as out of theheart the mouth speaketh I soon sayw things in their heartsnot right if I could judge from the causes they were persuing their feelings was we have power & influence & we will hold it. Br Hedlock continued to carry on Business 
 Snow at Springtown is about 18 Inches deep andat this place about 6, and only 6 miles apart. We havehad a beautifully mild season until Wednesday last whenthe snow fell very freely and it became intensly cold. We haveno wind storms to do us any serious damage in the countywith the exception of about one third of the roof of the Meetinghouse at Fort Ephraim which was blown off by reasonof a door being left open and the house being tight, it hadto burst. But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustainedby our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that nohuman lives were lost. Speaking of Judgments, the Lordsaid, "My saints shall hardly escape." Sickness and deathare our common lot; and though the summons be directagainst us or our best friends, we have to obey the mandateSickness is only one trial to prepare us for glory, and deaththe gate through which the just enter into it.Bro. Gibson, of whom you speak, is something morethan a political Mormon I hope. He has an extensivemission. I hope he may do good, he can do no harm to the cause.The road from the North Bend to Spanish Fork is workedthrough for horsemen and empty wagons, but to make ita good and safe thoroughfare, will require very much morelabor. Many of the citizens here have petitioned for anappropriation to work it through. Not, however, by my counselor suggestion, not but that such a measure is desirableto me; but I think the Legislation has appropriated too muchalready for individual aggrandizement with the view ofpublic good.

 Petitions to Hon G. A. Smith instead of forwarding themto a man who, after voting for a measure, turns round andsays, "you can't do any thing—it is the height of nonsenseto ask two dollars a bushel for wheat when it can bebought for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter." Wewant men who can do something. "You can't, you can't"never built, even, a house of Commons, let a lone the Kingdomof God. But when stray cattle are required to pay privateliabilities, the tone changes to, "I can, I can." This is no privacy. ItTwo weeks ago today, I preached just such a discourse inManti as I hinted to them that I should th in the second discoursethat I preached there. It made quite a fluttering in some quarters,yet the masses of the people brightened as though ten tuns burthenhad been removed from their shoulders. Many were in tears,others smiled, some as white as ghosts while the power ofGod enabled me to tell things about as existing evidencewill substantiate them. One remarked that that discoursecaused many a drooping branch to lift up its headIt was a faithful warning to evil doers.When a legal Governor vetoes the acts of an illegal Legislature, it is as 'twas; and 'twas as 'tisLincoln is Elected, and God's will in that is done.The times are becoming quite interesting. The Lord help all parties on in the way they want to go.The people are gathered for meeting so I must stopwriting and go to preaching {6 o'clock Sunday eveningand all is well.

 9thHe would sooner walk away from me thatn to acquiant mewith what he was doing. We have rented a New respectable officefor three years he has rented it in his own name Heis also renting a part of it in his own name. In facthe does all business in his own name without any regard tome whatever as Funding Emigration Renting rooms & onewould think from his actions that he was laying a foundationto speed generations to come upon his own Book in LiverpoolHe has been to much expens this season in publishing largehandbills & cards in his own name & settled them allover the kingdom as a general shiping agent without consultingme at all upon these things. He is so secret in his movements& singular in his habits that Neither myself nor any manabout the office knows whare he lives or Boards Neither canI find out though I have asked his several times He cardsit an insult to be asked the question. He has kept the TempleBooks untill of late & signed all the recept in his own nameAHe has manifested a spirit to gain all the influence possibleI had a plain talk with Elder Ward a short time sinceupon the subject. As I had heard much testimony fromothers what they had said behind my back. I told BrWard I knew my place & my councellors out to know italso. I informed him they could not [gruge] success or [swallow] me that if they undertoook to ride me they would finda hard seat before they got through. I told him that BrighamYoung & not Reuben Hedlock was president of the Church &if Hedlock had power & influence the presidency of the Church hadgiven it to him. And is he was in the way of his duty hewould throw that influence into the chanel what it outto be for the stream had run out of the chanel by EnoughI told him it was time for me to have for tiems forEmigration & for my name to appear upon the doorpost & sign Boards & hand Bills & cards as well as RHedlocks. Elder Hedlock had found fault because I hadinterfered with the Temple Books but I have gone forward 
 P. S. I perceive by the news that Bro Gardner Snow ofManti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He isa very good man; but is completely wraped up in his sonWarren and in George Peacock. The people of Sanpetehave paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvementscan be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. Itis like all improvements in Manti, unfineshed. SeveralBack houses have been begun, but I know not one finishedThe jail in like condition. $4,500 was the contract pricefor completeing it, as I am told, when $2,000 would build andcomplete a much better building than that would be of finishedThe county is greatly in debt, and no improvements that areof much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered,the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has sufferedThe people have suffered by their stocks being made intostrays and then into beef. This Indian department hassuffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations goingin the same way. The people of Sanpete think theBourbons have reigned long enough, and that BourbanDynasty should end. If the county seat were removedfrom Manti to Moroni or to Springtown it wouldsuit the notions of the people much better. If to MoroniM. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown,Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I haveexpressed no opinion here as to the removal of the countyseat, neither any with regard to this choice of a Judgeyet the above are my true sentiments and 19 twentiethsof the people here would endorse them, the opinionof our representative to the contrary notwithstanding 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah, Jeune 18, 1888.R. W. Sloan, Esq., Chicago.Dear Brother:Your favor of the 13th. inst., written at Minneapolis, has just been received and read with interest. Since our last reply to you we have received several papers containing interviews with you.We see nothing objectionable in your statements, when we consider the duties that you have assumed. In any other capacity than that in which you are acting, of course, different statements would be made. If you had not ac-cepted the position, doubtless some other person would have done so who would perhapshave made much broader statements than you have made, without giving informationthat would mitigate the bad effect, so far as our people are concerned. If you should be judged harshly by some who do not take into consideration all the circum-stances, or who may not know the motive you had in accepting the position which youoccupy, it will not be the first time that motives have been misconstrued and wrong judgements formed upon us; but we do not anticipate that there will be much of this.We are glad to hear that Dr. Miller, our old-time friend, still feels so kindly towards us and our rights. He has been, so far as we know, a constant and an undeviating friend and a liberal-minded man. When you return you

Woodruff, Moroni Sanpete Co USDear Brother, Dec 29. 1860I owe you manyapologies for not earlier answering your kindletter of the 20th Ulttno I have written to myfamily in the city but once since I left, andhave seen my wife in Sanpete but about threetimes since the President was here. I have beenvery busy in building me a house and in preaching the gospel. Away from home I seldomcould find a decent pere, or a half sheet of cleanpaper. I have written a little through necessitand a very little only. I might my many otherreasons for not writing, frome, but now for wantof a disposition to write. I have not had timeeven to write a love letter, however strong my in-clinations may have been to do so. I never labored with body and mind more intently in my lifethan during the past season. I am now reducedto the size of a decent man. But my house isso far finished that my goods are pitched intoit, and have left my family to regulate forthemselves while I go to Fillmore where Iexpect to be on New Years night. I am nowon my way there.Accept my thanks for your kindattention to my vineyard. It was a suemts

 Kirtland O. January 4, 1836.Dear BrotherYours came to hand 8 or 10 dayssince.  I hope you will pordan me for notwriting sooner, for I feel that I have a just causeto be excused.  And this because of a multiplicity ofbusiness.The Hebrew School commenced this day, and Ihope that I shall be able to attend it same, butaut of neusity I will be excluded part of thetime because of the press of business.You have no doubt an idea in regard tothe endowment and if you should suppose thatGod intends to indow a man to destroy anotherbecause he repents not I would inform you thatyour idea is incorrect, but I presume that youhave no such an idea.  God will indow noman except he has obtained wisdom and under ==standing enough to use power with discretionand according to the will of God.  I presumethe solemn assembly will take place in Febu-ary if there will be no hinderance in the comple=-tion of the house.I have written a letter to bro Seth Morley, andno doubt you have seen it ere this, had Itime I would write a long letter to you.  ButI have not.  And Elder Parish wrote you andyou have the Bible Book of Mormon & Book ofCovenants these together with the Sipirit of God with will make you wise unto salvation, and give youinteligence to lead others into the mansions ofbliss.  I am sensible that you feel your weeknesswhile in the days of your youth, and so for painyour brthren &the prophet or But be not dismayed trust in Godand you shall not be confounded, for rememberwhat our Savior saith of the the Ravens, and of theLillies of the field, they toil not neither do they spin but 
 12thcongenial spirit wandering to & fro so if all things havenot been conducted as you would wish in evry respect sinceI came here I trust you will make some allowance for my cituation I want the Anointed of the Lord to remember me in their prayers that I may have powerto fill my place & station & overcome evry obsticleAnd I am resolved to wage a warfare with both men& Devils in the name of Jesus Christ & by virtue of the Holy priesthood & the keys of the kingdom of God untill I can perfect stand in the lot & place that God & the president of the church has appointed me. You know myNature, make, & spirit  that I cannot sit down & restin peace if a work that I am appointed to do is not going right No I never was made to fold my arms atease & sleep while Zion is travelling in pairs to be delivered& while the God of heaven is whispering to me by the Holyspirit day & right that his judgements are spedily to be pouredout open this Nations as well as America & that all the gentileNations will follow in their train And urging me to magnify my calling while the day had lest Blood be found in my sheets& then when I meet my councellor instead of bowing our keedsKnees together to call upon God for my time to be spent in contendingfor my standing place rights & place at times it makes mesick at heart. I parktake of a portion of the same feeling that Joseph & Brigham is accquainted with at times when they have had to rise up & tell the people they are president for the people dont seem to know it among so many presidents unless theyacordingly tell them off it. 
 13I think I have said Enough upon this subject I have letout what was in my heart & I feel a good deal BetterAny council you have to give me I will abide by it accordingto the best of my ability. when men undertake to pull medown here they try to pull you down & when they pull you down they pull the kingdom of God down. But thank God they cant[curse] it. I know that God is with you & I know he is with me in this land & I shall do what I can for the cause, though I have been telling a kind of sorrowful taleI am not discouraged I am in good spirits the Lord is on our side & some men will learn a lesson in days to come. I have no disposition to injure Elder Hedlock or ward Iwish them well, though they have not taken a wise coursein all things since I came. If Elder Hedlock ever goes homeI think Elder Ward will work with me & harken to my councilHe is a vary capable useful business man if he takesa right course. I have not brought up any of these things wishing to make an accusation or case of trial of them but thatyou might know the truth of my circumstances. I know how to pray for me. With regard to the joint stockcompany Elders Hedlock Ward & Wilson are the mainofficers in it at present. I think their was a spirit manifestin some deepest at its organization against my being a director in it but at that time I did not wish it & refusedto have as I had so much on hand but as most of themembers & Directors are members of the Church I thinkthey will harken to our council upon the subject I havetried in all my council & Teachings to impress uponthe minds of all the importance & Necessity of walking bythe council of the presidency of the church & I think they will doit. They find it much more Expressing than they expected toget registered according to act of parlament & to get theseal of State. It will cost over of £100 pounds 
 I have perhaps it is due Elders Hedlock & Ward to say thatin the midst of all our affairs their has been no spiritmanifest by them that they wanted to appostitize & leavethe work, but to keep what power & influence they have& get more if they could even if it was at my expensthey had been appointed Agents & presidents over thecould Church & they could not get it intotheir heads that their presidency seased when I cameI have written a letter to you about the BellI hope I shall have ian answer soom for if the Bell is Bought in America to save so heavyDuty as 230 per cent I will immediately forward the money to you to purchase it the first safeopportunity.

 [sideways text] A. E. Hinckley.HackberryJan 31 [18]83 [end of sideways text]For President John Taylor.Hackbery, Jan. 15th, 1883.President Woodruff.Dear Brother,I sit downto drop you a few lines. You will excuse the bad gram-mar, spelling, without any punctuation, passing overall, until we come to this place. On the 26th of Dec.last we arrived at this place, and found a portion of the Wallapais tribe of Indians here, and added to their lowand filthy condition, the corruption and diseases of civ-ilization and, in looking forward to the time when theLord would fulfil his promises upon them, I realizedthat it was the Lord's work, and that He would have towork by his power, manifest in their midst, to bring itabout. I learned that this nation had no place to gatherto, to farm and till the earth. The whites have taken upthe watering places, and the Indians, in many places wherethey used to be the lords of the soil, have to pay to watertheir horses now. The government has stopped giving themrations and they are in a bad condition. Still, the chiefrefuses to accept of our going to any place with them, tolearn them to farm, or school their children. He says thatthey were on the reservation a few years, their children toschool, many of them died, and he would rather they wouldlive, hunt rabbits, work for the Americans, cut wood, washdishes, and so forth, than gather together, be sick and die, and he does not want us to come there with anything of theand have not done so. They appear always to remember a promise. Our promise is to write to the Mormon Chief, and he will do as he thinks best, and Brother Harris isto meet them and report to them whether there is any one comesor not, and, if not, to tell them the reason why. There is largetracts of good land on the Colorado River, above and below FortMojave. The Shemojaves are situated in their valley about60 miles below the Fort. There is some good land in theirvalley, but most of the tribe is below there, on the reservationon the California side, 50 miles below their valley, and aportion of the Mojave tribe is on this side the river, oppo-site them, on their reservation. The location is good to reachthem and the Wallapais in the Mojave Valley, and this Chiefthat can read and write we think will be of great benefit tothe cause, if he obeys the Gospel. The promises made to them,the Mojaves, was 20 years ago, or more, yet they told us of it.This shows that they never forget, so that we made ours con-ditional, as I said. Told them that the Lord had told ourChief to send us out to tell them to be at peace with all,to become one with us, to learn to do good, be brothers together.I guess that I have written enough in my wandering waythis time. Hope that I shall be able to say more in less wordsin the future.With love and peace to all,We remain, your brothers in the Gospel,A. E. Hinckley. 
 kind at present. He says that he may know better aftera while, but until then this is his decision positive now.The tribe is fast wasting away with venereal diseases.There appears to be no place to commence with them, butto work with their neighbors. We have been to the Mojavetribe. They wish you to send some families to come and work with them, teach them better how to farm and school theirchildren. They make two propositions—one, to go with someof them and clear some land, 20 miles below St. Mojave; another, on a piece of land above the fort, about four miles,which is cleared, which the River overflows, and is sure ofmaking a crop. The land below is not safe or sure withoutdigging wells and putting up windmills. The land in bothplaces is very rich. The land below belongs to government andthe Railroad. That above is at present occupied by the headChief. The chiefs are very anxious, and also the people, to have some of our people to come, and we think that it isone of the best chances of bringing about the work with them.Brother Harris has promised to be back there in four months.He expresses himself that he would like to go and settlethere, as he says that they are the finest tribe in this Territory.They are a very industrious people, but they have become verymuch diseased and are somewhat under the control of thewhites, but there is no denomination or sect among them.The second chief can read and write. We left with him theVoice of Warning and promised to send to him the Book of Mormon. His name is Mariman. If you can sendhim the book, address it to him, Mariman, a Chief of Mojave Indians, Fort Mojave. He is a well disposedman. He says that he wants to do right when he knowswhat right is. We think that he will be a very usefulman in the future. We think that 2 or 3 families ateach place could do great good. Brother Harris willbe there about the first of May, and if you think that it is wise to send some Elders to meet him there, eitherwith or without their families, to commence work withthem, you will please let us know at Mesa. Direct incare of Pres. A. F. MacDonald. If they come, the mostdirect road will be by St. George, Pearce's Ferry, from thenceto Mineral Park, from there to Fort Mojave. We send thisby way of suggestion. Brother Harris will meet them, theChiefs, whether anyone is sent or not. It will be as you,the Council say, whether he stops with them or not. Hehas said as much, that he would like to do so, if he couldbe as useful there as otherwise. He is a very zealousman. As to myself, to be a travelling missionary than to belocated in a tribe, and indeed I believe with such aman as Ephraim Hanks, if we were as well unitedin faith and feelings as we were when we were outto meet the hand-cart company, that we would be will-ing to keep on south among the Lamanites until wecome to the end of them, if we could live faithful enoughto do so. The Mojaves say that the Mormons havebeen to their tribe twice and promised to come back,

 Wrexham Monday 26 Feby. 1845Dr Br Woodruff,I have neglected writing until now, expecting to have the betternews to give you, because I had some forebodings of glorious consequences.Of course Br. Stratton told you how I was getting on up to the time of hisdeparture. Since then I have been working my way into the heart of theWelsh Colleries, & Ironworks, but have found my way blocked up, by the preposesed prejudices, predicated upon the ffalse statements of returning Apostatesas well as all other lies that any Impostors, or bad men have ever ben guiltyof, all the stories I think that the Devil & his Priests can think of, are sentthe rounds here too, but as luck wd have it, by being a little sly I scaled someof their Ramparts before they were aware, and I hope, have put in a little leavenbut the Priests here are not doing much else, but consulting together whatto do with me, the first thing of cours was to turn me out of the good old synagouge and caution all their sheep, not to believe, or talk to me, they would not allow me to givemy reasons for leaving them, but through the influence of a friend, I got posses-ition of one of ^their^ sanctuarys last Sabbath ^week^ about 5 miles from here, & got my ownplay for the time, but since then the deacon has been under the eeves of that Sanctumbut since Br. Stratton left I have prepared a work for the press, principally aboutthe order ^of^ the Kingdom set up in the days of the Apostles, & illustrating the firstprinciples, the immutability of the Gospel &c something similar to P. P. Pratts,on ^the^ Kingdom, in the voice of warning, but Welsh of course, twil be in pampletform about two sheets, or 48 pages, of twelve fold, close type, they wanted £16 pn 1000 but tomorrow I have ^to^ go & see another printer, & will make a trade with himfor a thousand copies ^for something less^ & get him to print them in two weeks, I have to depend on you to send me that amt, by that time, for I need not expect any quarters fromany source, neither would I have any one know here my financial affairs, uponany consideration, I have had to steer between wind & water, with friend & foe,and carry ^a^ stiff upper lip, for I have to pay my board here & wife. My wife's illnesshas kept me here rather confined, & while this work is going through the PressI will have to be here to correct the proof sheets, but have some open heartedfriends in Wales, who have invited me to see them, some dozen miles off or so,them of cours I will attend too, in the mean time, but after I get this workoutI will take a larger circuit, especially after conference. I am glad withalthey are making such a stir among the^mse^lves, on my act. here, I expect my wifesilness will be ofver before I come to conference, and I hope that by then, theobject I had hinted to Br S. about, will be acomplished, all right thus far, &cWould I had a mate, who would go shoulder to shoulder with me in the Welsh!But I have a p[r]ospect of one before long, one who has his hand in, but tho, I shd remain aloneI am resolved in the strength of Joseph's God, to die on the field of battle, rather than [m]eet my kindred on that day, & found guilty of their blood, poor people, they know not what they are doing. the best way of remittance will bye by post office.

John Taylor and also in response to adesire on our part to see a proper biographical and chrono-logical history of his life presented to the public wehave thought providing the matter meets your approvaland concurrence of publishing, at an early a day as possible,a biograpy of his life, together with such contemporaneoushistory, memoirs etc. as space and the scope of thework will permit.With reference to the propriety of the publication of sucha work, it is perhaps unnecessary for us to offer anyspecial argument; but it seems to us that the issuanceof such a work would fill a two or three-fold mission.The people, we believe, would not only welcomely receiveany work which would properly recount the incidentsand lessons of the life of such a man as their late

 HOME. FAMILY.ESTABLISHED 1879.35,000 Members. A GREAT FRATERNAL ORDER.The Order of Chosen Friends.ITS OBJECTS AND PLANS.The Order of Chosen Friends is a FraternalBenevolent and Protective Society. Its businessis conducted privately, yet in such a manner thatthose conscientiously opposed to secret societiescan endorse and affiliate with it.It was established May 28, 1879, in the city ofIndianapolis, Indiana. It has now over 700Councils and 35,000 members in the United Statesand Canada. It is an Order making provisionsfor paying, in addition to sick and death benefits,one to its aged members, and also providing for abenefit to those who become totally disabled byreason of either disease or accident. It has metwith the approval and endorsement of the think-ing public. The success and growth of theChosen Friends in the past, confirms the wisdomof its projectors, and the adaptability of theOrder to meet the wants of thousands who arewithout any, or need more, protection.The Order is representative in its management,having a Democratic-Republican form of govern-ment. It is in fact, a sovereignty within itself;self-controlling and independent. Within its ownprescribed sphere its authority is supreme. Itsmembers acquiesce in the teachings of its faith,and are required to yield obedience to its laws.Friendship and fraternal co-operation is the cen-tral principle by which it is governed, the power2that gives potency to its resolves. The perpetu-ation of the Order depends upon an adhesion tothe established principles of its ritual and itsfundamental laws, and upon the recognition byChosen Friends of the great principles of Fra-ternity, Aid and Protection. The distinctive featuresare briefly stated in the followingOBJECTS OF THE ORDER:1. To unite fraternally acceptable white per-sons of good character, steady habits, sound bodilyhealth and reputable calling, who believe in a Supreme Being.2. To improve their condition morally, socially and materially, by timely counsel and instructivelessons; encouragement in business, and assist-ance to obtain employment when in need.3. To establish a Relief Fund from which asum not exceeding three thousand dollars ($3,000)shall be paid:a. When a member becomes disabled by theinfirmities of old age: Provided, the age ofseventy-five years has been reached.b. When by reason of disease or accident, amember becomes permanently disabled from fol-lowing any occupation.c. When a member has died.SECURITY OF THE ORDER.The history of kindred fraternal societiesproves that the plighted faith of the members ofan organization who are bound in honor and self-interest to maintain its integrity, can be reliedupon for protection and good faith quite as con-fidently as business companies managed by menwhose interests are in natural conflict with thoseof their patrons. The co-operation of men andwomen for mutual protection, on an equitableand economical basis, is a matter of prudence,justified by our daily experience.The Order has three divisions; these are:1. Supreme Council.2. Grand Councils and Districts.3. Subordinate Councils.3

 president, but the presentation of such a work woulddo much to encourage and confirm the people in prin-ciples of faith and integrity. Many of the letters andwritings of TaPres. Taylor deal with the vital principles ofour religion, others with our rights as citizens; and arepetition of these like the repetition of any principleof truth would be salutory and proper for all people, andtheir existence should be kept green. Again, such a work,if properly written and judiciously compiled, would do muchto still more fully foster and encourage the literary tastes ofthe people, as it may also encourage the efforts of thosewho undertake the work of publication; but we shallnot try to protractedly enumerate the possible goodwhich may accrue from the matter, believing that youappreciate and understand these matters quite as well asthey they can be represented; and that if you ^it^ isdeemed wise that such a work should, be pub-lished and placed before the people that it willreceive your full sancition and approval.In the event of undertaking this work, we do not ofcourse wish to lay ourselves liable to the publicationof any erroneous principles; and in order to preventthe possiblity of any thing of this kind happening, we(over)

 March 1850Dear Brother WoodruffIt is with pleasure I embrace the present oportunity of adressing a few lines to you respecting your clothes. Our work fell off as I antisepated and with the sanction and councle of Bro Cartwright. I got the cloth of my Employer as he profered me aney thing I wanted at wholesale prices, as he said was his custom to his Employes, and I did it the more readeyly before the money was obtained, as I shouldnot then be restricted to a few shilling in the price of the article as we should have been after a scertain amount had been obtainedI selected a good firm Bodey'd cloth for coat and vest one that I beleive will weare well and strong. it is wool dyed, and cost 4 1/4 p. yd and the pantaloons are the heavest and best that is made and I beleive you will say it is the best price of good's evver you had it cost 2.88 per yd and I hope it will give you and Sister Woodruff satisfaction I was in hopes to have seen you before you left New York, to have tried on a calico coat I cut out, expecting to see you but not haveing the oportunity I made it to the measure, and if there is aney part of it which requires alteration I shall be happey to do so 
 The Supreme Council is regularly incorporatedunder the laws of the State of Indiana.From this body emanate all laws for the govern-ment of the Order, and to it is entrusted the en-tire management of the Relief Fund.Subordinate Councils are local organizations forthe extension of the Order in their immediatevicinity. They have the power to solicit, acceptand reject members who are admitted on petition,by ballot. Every applicant for membership mustbe over eighteen years of age, of good moral char-acter, steady habits, reputable calling, soundbodily health, and believe in a Supreme Being.The admission of members is guarded by pro-tective rules similar to those of the Masonic, OddFellows, and other successful fraternal organiza-tions, and for beneficiary membership by a thorough medical examination of each candidate.Beneficiary membership is optional with themember. The Subordinate Council is expectedto provide for the social, moral and intellectualimprovement of its members, for the relief ofthe sick, for the assistance of those out of employ-ment, for the encouragement of its members inbusiness, and for the inculcation and dissemina-tion of the principles of Fraternity, Aid and Pro-tection. By-Laws to accomplish this are framedby each Council as desired.Meetings are held weekly or semi-monthly andmembers must pay dues quarterly in advance.Each Council fixes the amount to be paid as dues.One dollar per quarter is recommended, if Coun-cil does not pay sick benefits.HOW COUNCILS ARE INSTITUTED.Subordinate Councils are organized by theSupreme Councilor, or his representatives ap-pointed for that purpose, on the application oftwenty or more persons possessing the necessaryqualifications, and who agree, by ballot, at thetime of organization, to associate with each otherin fraternal relation.This Order permits an unlimited membership on theCharter list Strong Councils, with a large mem-bership in each, are preferred.4MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS.A rigid medical examination is required by anauthorized Medical Examiner, and the applica-cation must be approved by the SupervisingMedical Examiner before the member can be-come beneficiary.EXPENSE OF ORGANIZATION.No Charter fee is required. A set of suppliessufficient usually to last the Council for severalmonths, and most of the books will last for years,is furnished free. The membership fee is $5.00.This fee, each applicant for beneficiary mem-bership must pay, and it coversMedical Examiner's Fee As agreed uponSupervising Medical Examiner's Fee $0.50Certificate Fee 1.00Balance is placed in Council Treasury.In addition to the $5.00 above mentioned, eachbeneficiary member must pay one advance Assess-ment, according to age and amount of ReliefFund Certificate (see table of rates).Social members are not required to pay Medi-cal Examiner's fee or assessments, but must paya Certificate fee of $1.00; which certificate canbe exchanged for a Relief Fund Certificate should the member become beneficiary within one yearfrom the date of initiation.The membership fee must be paid to the Sec-retary; Medical Examiner's fees and SupremeMedical Examiner's fees, to the Medical Exami-ner; all other fees, to the Secretary of the Coun-cil, to be applied as directed by the Constitutionsand Laws.RELIEF FUND.There is connected with this Order a ReliefFund, from which each member, or the properlydesignated beneficiary, is entitled, under the pre-scribed regulations, to draw a sum not exceedingthe amount named in the Relief Fund Certificate.These certificates are issued either in theamount of five hundred, one, two or three thou-sand dollars, as the member applying for thesame may elect, subject, however, to the approval5

 Cincinnati Oct 23rd 1849Dear Brother WoodruffI take this opportunity to writethese few lines to you in order to asertainewhat restitution I and my wife are to makein order to be brought into the Church as weare both willing to do all that lays in ourpower for we take it very hard to be hereand cannot enjoy ourselves with the Saintsof God. we are willing to make acknow-ledgement to all that we have done andwe are determined to keep the command-ments of God for the future, but at thesame time believe that there has beena great deal said that was not true butwhat has been done was through theteachings of William Walker and otherswhile we were in England. the reason mywife left New York was because of thescandle that was raised about her byMr J D Brown for he stated that my wife was in the family way be Littlefieldwhich has proved itself fals so my wifethought she would come to me and get meto write to N York to you but I took verysick so that I could not write in time beforethe letter came to this place stating 
 of the Supervising Medical Examiner, who hasfull authority to refuse an application, or to re-duce the amount as he shall deem right.Beneficiary members are required to pay intothe Relief Fund an amount, graded according toage, as follows:TABLE OF RATES.AT THE AGES OF ON $500. ON $1,000. ON $2,000. ON $3,000.18 and 25, incl., $0.35 $0.70 $1.40 $2.10  26 and 30, incl., .40 .80 1.60 2.40  31 and 35, incl. .45 .90 1.80 2.70  36 and 40, incl. .50 1.00 2.00 3.00  41 and 45, incl. .60 1.20 2.40 3.60  46 and 50, incl. .75 1.50 3.00 4.50  51 and 54, incl. 1.00 2.00 4.00 6.00    And this amount, paid by the applicant onapplying for a Relief Fund Certificate, remainshis or her Assessment for life (or until 75 years ofage), and is paid, without notice or demand, onthe first day of each calendar month, except whenthe Assessment is remitted, which is done whenthe amount in the Relief Fund is sufficient topay all claims that are, or may be, presentedduring the succeeding month.Up to July 1, 1894, this Order has issued90,000 Relief Fund Certificates to members.It has received and disbursed for its objects$8,500,000.00. It is now paying benefits at therate of about $3,000 every day in the year.SECURITY OF FUNDS.All officers of the Order who have charge ofany of its funds are required to give sufficient bond for the faithful discharge of their duties.These bonds may be increased from time to time,and are always in a sum not less than double theamount the officer will probably at any time havein his hands. In addition to these safeguards,such an arrangement has been made with thebanks where the Relief Fund is deposited that itcan only be drawn on the regular Relief Fund warrants,thus putting it out of the power of the officers touse it for any purpose except to pay death anddisability benefits.6YELLOW FEVER.This Order does not extend into the yellowfever districts, as Councils are not allowed to beorganized in the States of Mississippi, Arkansas,Alabama, Louisiana and Florida, and portions ofTennessee and Georgia, in which that disease hasprevailed.SUMMARY.The Order of Chosen Friends combines the fol-lowing substantial benefits and advantages:1. Death benefits of from $500 to $3,000.2. Disability benefits of from $250 to $1,500.3. Old age benefits of from $500 to $3,000.4. Sick benefits of $5 or more a week.5. It admits males and females to member-ship with equal privileges.6. It secures more benefits for less moneythan any other Order.7. It is the great family Order of the country.The family is the greatest institution in theworld, and an Order that incorporates that insti-tution into itself is destined to become the strong-est in the world.CONCLUSION.This Order offers the surest way to prevent thehousehold loaf from being buried with the house-hold head. It helps to rid the community ofpauperism and of the crimes incident to poverty.It brings relief to the sorrows of bereavement,and brightens the pathway of the distressed. Itprovides a property not exposed to the demandsof creditors, but protected by law for one's beneficiary. It brings ready money just at thatmoment when it is most timely and welcome.To all who want more, or have no life or healthprotection, the ORDER OF CHOSEN FRIENDS presentsthe same better than can be obtained elsewhere.If there is not a Council in your vicinity, help toorganize one. If there is a Council, join it.For particulars address any Officer.7

 To President Wilford Woodruff, and the Twelve Apostles.Dear sir when I sent to you last winter for the priviledge and appointment, of teachingthe principles of the gospel contained in the New Testament, Book of Mormon, and FormerCommandments, you did not according to the conduct of your servant Sakes, think it worthyour while to even give a respectable answer to my request, but said that there was nothingworth answering that he knew of. I would not at this ^time^ think that it would be worth while to writeany more to you, if I had not been reading your Epistle to the Church, for you appear so indepen-dent, yea so much above your fellow man, that I should leave you go on to the end of your days,but my soul is filled with sorrow, when I behold the miserable condition you and the peopleare in. In your Epistle you give your testimony about what the prophet Joseph taught you andthe Twelve Apostles before his death, and the keys, endowments, blessings, and powers you receivedfrom him, and that he appointed no one but the Twelve that should have authority to lead theChurch, and you are the last of that Twelve, that heared these things. It is now over forty 40 yearssince that time and you are the last of that wasTwelve that was left by Joseph to lead the Church.Even forty years is a long time to wait for that, that may be compared to a great river of corru-ption and wickedness that did spring from the unbelief and carnal desires of the peoplethat are now nearly all passed away. The darkness of that unbelief was terrible to behold, in it many of the sheep of the fold has been scattered to an fro, here and there, and almost everywhere. Are you not satisfied with the past experience and misery of this people? Do youwant to continue this state of things, until those that are scattered will all perish, andthe riseing generation to dwindle away in unbelief, without a knowledge of God, likean anchor to hold them, while the storms are beatting about them?

 Quorum in the Church. I did think that what I wrote to you before was plain enoughfor almost any one to understand, but at this time, I shall try to write still plainer to you, so that you ^may^ have a better understanding conserning the things that will come to pass. I am sorry that the Chuch was in such a lamentable condition of unbelief, at the time you testify that you and the Twelve got your endowments, keys, blessings, and powers, fromJoseph Smith the prophet. If you had been faithful to God as you should have been, instead ofreceiveing your endowments from man, you could have a greater blessing from God, even the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as they did on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem; you could have the promise of the Savior made good to you, so well as them; See the last chapter of Mark as follows: "And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." xx [##Mark 16:17-18##] "And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following." See also the teachingof Paul the apostle in first Corinthians and 12th chapter on spiritual Gifts. [##I Corinthians 12##]I call your attention to these things because you appear as if you had forgotten them, in your great zeal to establish an other order of things in the Church. Through your transgressions you have lost much of the powers of heaven, you have exchangedthe blessings of heaven for the things of the earth, instead of being spiritually minded, you have become carnally minded, and have addopted a law of carnal com-mandments, instead of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What has become of the spirit-ual Gifts that was given by the God of heaven, with the Everlasting Gospel in the beginning, when it was restored in its fullness to man on the earth? Did you and the Twelve Apostles all agree and join together, to stop the Saints that had these gifts touse them? If you did have a voice or vote to that effect, you are under condemnation.

 If you will read the last chapter in the Book of Mormon, you shall there see the last testi-mony of Moroni as follows: "And wo unto them who shall do these things away and die, for they die in their sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I speak it according to the words of Christ, and I lie not." {##Moroni 10:26|Moroni 10:26##] He also says that he will meet all that hasor will do any such an evil deed at the bar of God, and then He (God) will ask you ifHe did not warn you through this man (Moroni) against such a wicked deed. The Saints had sacrifised all earthly pleasures, leaveing their homes and relations and endureinginsults, dishonor, and persecution, for the sake of secureing the favor and gifts of the Eternal God, according to the promise of His Son, but to their grief and dissappointment when they arrived among the mountains of Utah, instead of being encouraged in their spiritual course of righteousness, their attention was called to a law of carnal com-mandments doing away with that which was spiritual, even those things that was their comfort, and consolation, that enabled them to endure all their aflictions, and tribulations,even the grandest and greatest gifts of God to man, that they relied on in life, or in death,in time, or in eternity, even the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Where was that love and sym-pathy that you should have for your brothers and sisters, when you caused them to stop useing the gifts of the gospel of Christ? The greatest comfort they had in the world was taken from them at that time, the Gifts that enabled them to communewith the Great Father and Son, through the Holy Ghost, the saints was hindered from useing. What right do you suppose you had to change the sacred and eternal order of the house or Church of God? Even stopping the Gifts of the Spirit of God, the only means of salvation given through our Savior to mankiind. How manyhearts do you think you have caused to be broken, by trying to comply with your order of things? Thousands of innocent, harmless, and good people, has come to these mountains, for the purpose of doing God's will, and to gain a greater portion

I waspresident of a Ward Primary Associationat the time the call was made for meansto complete our grand & noble Temple & Ifound out my nerves were giving out underthe strain of that ^&^ with the cares of a largefamily of small children & unable to affordhelp. but my desire to keep up untilwe had given entertainments enough todonate a goodly portion to that cause prevented me from resigning & the Sisterswith whom I was laboring felt like itwould be wrong to resign when weI had 
 Kalihiwai Kauai S. IslandsFeb. 7th 1855Brother WoodruffDear SirIn compliance with yourrequest, I will endeavor to improve the present opportunityby writing a few lines to you. With a few slight exceptionsI have enjoyed good health since leaving the valley.I presume you are aware of our delay at California, whichwas occasioned by circumstances that we were unable tocontrol, therefore I believe it was all right. I landed atHonolulu the 24th of December in company with Bros. Caineand Johnson, being the last that arrived, of the Breathrenthat were ^appointed^ to this mission, by the last April conference.I stayed in Honolulu untill after the funeral of the oldKing and the coronation of his successor, which took placeon the 10th & 11th of Jan. The funeral procession was a sple-ndid affair and reflected much credit on the Kingdom.As this Island had been designated as my future field oflabor, myself and Bro. Whitney (who was also appointed tothis Isdland) took the steamer on the 12th and arrived at thisIsland the morning of the 13th & amediatly commenced thetask of learning the native language. Bros. R. A. Allredand Molen are upon this Island. Bro. Molen has been hereabout three months, he can talk some but has not asufficient knowledge of the language to preach much yet, butis making rapid progress, the young Breathren generaly aremaking are obtaining the language very readily, some ofthem have commenced preaching. Judging from the lengthof time that I have been here, Bro. Molen thinks I will getthe language pretty quick, but it is tedious for a person thathas not been accustomed to confine their mind to any onething. The Breathren that were here when the last lotcame, will all probably leave for home, after our July 
 David & Emma DayOct 23rd 1849Answered Nov 9th 49Advised them to write toO Hyde & get advice 
 4of spiritual power from Him who is Almightly, but to our sorrow instead of geting moreabundantly of the fruit of righteousness, even that portion we had was made inactiveor inoperative through your Order of things. The nurishment that is necessary fora spiritual increase has been stopped, the result is a spiritual weakness causeing many to be discouraged and fall by the way unheeded and unaided by many thatpass by. The young people among us have not been accustomed to see nor feel the power of God manifested through the Gifts of the Spirit, the most of them depend on the words of others, instead of getting a Knowledge for themselves from God. Hence the urgent necessity of granting me and others that desire, the priviledge and right to preach the fullness of the Gospel, as it was restored in its purity from God, to man in these last days. I hope that the end of all that is dark corrupt and miserable is at hand, and that the dawning of a brighter day will soon spread its glory over the world, when the Gifts of the Holy Ghost which is the power of the Everlasting Gospel, will be enjoyed by all those that believe in it.  There is thousands of honest people in these mountains that would be willing and thankful to have the priviledge to live according to the fullness of the Gospel, and would rejoice and give glory to Godin the hightest, if they had the gifts of the Holy Ghost according to the promise of Jesus Christ. If you deem yourselves unworthy to receive the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to the pattern given in the Holy scriptures, then you should step asideto make room for them that have faith, that God can and will bring about a restoreation, of all the gifts and powers that has been lost to you by transgression, but secured to all that have faith in the unchangeable covenant of the Everlasting Gospel. What do you suppose that furture generations will think of your conduct towardsme, in refuseing to give me a hearing, when I testify to you conserning the things that has been revealed to me? If you do not repent, your condemnation will go forth 
 New York Dec 19th [18]49Dr Brother Woodruffaccordingto your request I will give youmy oppinion with regard to the bestroute from Saint Louis to the Bluffs.the route I would advise—is—that by Montrose or Keokuck Iowafrom thence to Fort desmoines andfrom thence to the Bluffs by wayof Pisgah or by the new route latelylaid out. My reasons—are these1st. You will abvoid the difficult and dangerous navigation of the Missouri river2nd You will ^be^ enabled to purchase your waggons in Saint Louis—ship them up to the above places—there fit them up for yourjourney while at the same time a portionof your company couldcan go out into the Northern part of Illenoise orinto Missouri bordering on the Missippi where oxen and cowsare much cheaper than at the Bluffs

 conference. Bros. Johnson Karren & Lawson have gone.I believe the work is prosperous on these Islandsgeneraly speaking, although the faith of the saints areis weakin some places, they are a weak minded people and unlesscontinualy stired up will becom[e] slack and negligent.at one branch where I stayed a couple of weeks, the PresidingElder and a number of the members threatened to leavethe Church in consequence of having to feed us, but thereare many good saints here, that are willing to do allthey can for the Elders, but after all the Elders havea great many difficulties to encounter as the natives areso poor it is almost impossible to get the means to defraythe expences of going to the different Islands, to attend conference&c. But when a servent of God goes out in the world to procl-aim the principles of  eternal life, they naturaly expectto to see hard times. I fancy they do not expect the same kindof fare that they receive at home in the valleys of the mou-ntains, at least I did not, I expected to pass through somepretty tight places, and ^to^ undergo hardships & suffer privations,if I do not have to suffer anything but should receive mypay as I go along of course I should not expect to be rewardedhereafter, my prayer is continualy that the Lord willstreangthen me & enable me to be the instrument in hishands of accomplishing some good in this Kingdom.It appears to be a difficult task to better the condition ofthis people in their present condition situation, surroundedwith the influences that dos surround them.This is a splendid country and in the hands of an enterp-rising people could no doubt be made very productive,vegitation grows the year round, which gives the face ofthe country a beautiful aspect.While in California we heard a great deal about the anex-ation of these Islands to the United States but afterwe arrived here we did not hear much about it, and I 
 5from generation to generation, so long as your history will be known among men. But if you do repent and turn to the Lord, with all your heart, then you shall be ab-undantly blessed, and rejoice in the way of salvation in your old age. I ask can it be possible that you have willingly cast away the sweet influencies of the Gifts of the Spirit of God, in exchange for those things which are caral, vain, sinful, and degrading in their nature? How long will you strive to lock out of the Church, the wisdom and power ofGod, to make room for the display of your carnal performances? I wonder that you have been so much like the children of Israel anciently, their prophet Moses desired that they should sanctify themselves, but they would not come up to that hight standard of perfec-tion, so he gave them a law of carnal commandments. [##Exodus 34##] Has it not been so with you inthese days? Would you choose to appear before our Savior as the advocate and defen-der of a law of carnal commandments instead of being an advocate and defender of the Gospel of Jesus Christ?  If so, then I ask you where is that substancial manhood, andindependence of character, that should adorn every one that will have the honor, of being called valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ? Have you been so high minded as to over-look the above priceless stamp of human character? I look with admiration upon themanhood and independence of character manifested in the life of our Savior, and others I could name; but a perverted manhood and independence, I despise. I ask what can be the reason that it appears by your condict, that you can not afford the time, to write or speak to your fellow man, when you think him below your rank of honor? Where did you find such an example of perverted aristocratic pride, in the Gospel of Christ? We have such as the above example, given by them of old, who persecuted and killed the prophets, and them that God had sent to them. Would you also follow after them? I have never refused to speak or reason, on the fair and grand platform of equality, with any of my fellow men, be they high or low; in the esteemation of other men. If we
