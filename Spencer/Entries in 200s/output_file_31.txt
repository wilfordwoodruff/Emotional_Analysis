Pres Woodruff    Dear Sir  When in Salt Lake City last  spring I meet a gentleman who  once lived in Endfield Conn  We had a long talk about growing  tobacco in Utah. I said tobacco  could be grown for a profit in  Utah the same as it is being  done near No Yakama Washington  The tobacco grown in the Cash  Valley would have a nice flavor  like havana, and would make an  extra nice filler and binder  but not a good wrapper, as  it would be in my opinion to  thick. I spoke to Mr Albert Clark  of Poquonock Conn about going to  Utah to raise tobacco. Mr Clark  is a good honest man about 35 years  old one of our kind of people.  I came from Tariffville Conn near

My  circumstances are at present of such a  nature, and condition that it seems to  me impossible to leave them, at so early   a date as you mention. I have made a  pre-enption and will have to live on the  land this comming summer to secure  it, and there are other matter that  absolutely require to be properly adjusted,  before my leaving home.

 Office of  CITY RECORDER.    Spanish Fork City, U. T. June 30, 1890    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  S. L. City    Dear Brother;    Having not as yet received a   reply to my communication of under date  of the 22nd, I thought it quite probable   that you had failed to receive it, and there  fore again address this note to you.    It would be almost impossible under the   present circumstances for me to leave by July  16th. The Ward & City Records which I have  now in my possession are very far behind,   the former being about 2 years beghind on   account of failure of my predecessor who   has not his work finished. These together   with sickness in my family would prevent my   going at so early a date. I would therefore re  spectfully ask for a short time ^2 or 3 months^  in which to  prepare and  await your reply.    Your brother in the Gospel  Hyrum F. Thomas    I would give him   the time asked.

I would much rather have been  called to Great Britain, as my  parents and all my relatives on both  my father and mother's side are scotch.  One reason for rather going there is  to get the genealogy of my ancestors  If it meets with your approval to  make the change I will be thankful  and if not I will try and make arran

Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    Replying to your favor of 3rd, inst., would respect-  fully state that at the time the application for pass in favor of Brother  Isaac M. Waddell was received, we were making an arrangement to limit the  issue of passes for the present year, and only on agrreded lists with other  Companies.    Thus far we have issued passes to the Quorom of the Twelve to some   Stake Presidents and their Counselors and a few others, and we find that  the list far exceeds our expectations. It is probably needless to tell   you that the number of passes in Utah has been very great, and that the  Railways are not earning what is necessary to satisfy the owners, hence  our instructions to retrench wherever possible. I regret it will not  be consistent at this time to issue pass to Bro. Waddell.    Yours very truly,  James Sharp  asst, General Superintendent.

Dear Brethren:    Agreeable to your letter of request  of the 6th inst, wherein you ask that a suitable person ^be found^ to fill the  office in Copenhagen, as a translator of both the English and also  of the Danish languages, we take pleasure in saying that we wrote  to several, all of whom replied their willingness to go, but for  their financial condition, with the exception of Brother C.

His letter will explain itself.    iImmediately upon receipt of your letter, we communicated with   several whom we thought were both suitable and could as well go as  any we knew of; but their replies have just arrived. We trust this  Brother Thorestensen will fill all requirements,    and Remain,    Very Truly Your Brother,    John M. Whitaker    Gen Secy.   Protem

Salt Lake City, Utah, April 16th, 1890 18    President Wilford Woodruff  and Councillors.    Dear Brethren:    I am directed by the First Council of Seventies to lay  the following facts before you for your consideration and action:    On March 5th of this year we sent you a list of 15 names  recommednded, to us as worthy and prepared to go on missons by the  first of April. With this recommendation, we forwarded to you the  names, among which was one, Brother George W. Webster, of Kaysville,  whom, it seems, was recommednded, under a mistake by his Quorum Presi-  dents, as being ready to go. Brother Webster was today at our  meeting stating he had received a call to go to New Zealand, but  was totally unprepared, at the present time to go, but was willing  to go soon as his business relations could be brought to a satis-  factory termination.    Brother Reynolds knows something of the facts, and with these  statemesnts, we leave the matter in your hands to act as you deem  proper.    With Kind Regards,  I remain Your Brother,    John M.
