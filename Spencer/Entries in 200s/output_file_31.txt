Woodruff,Salt Lake City.Dear Brother:Replying to your favor of 3rd, inst., would respect-fully state that at the time the application for pass in favor of BrotherIsaac M. Waddell was received, we were making an arrangement to limit theissue of passes for the present year, and only on agrreded lists with otherCompanies.Thus far we have issued passes to the Quorom of the Twelve to some Stake Presidents and their Counselors and a few others, and we find thatthe list far exceeds our expectations. It is probably needless to tell you that the number of passes in Utah has been very great, and that theRailways are not earning what is necessary to satisfy the owners, henceour instructions to retrench wherever possible. I regret it will notbe consistent at this time to issue pass to Bro. Waddell.Yours very truly,James Sharpasst, General Superintendent.

As I stated in my former letter, I place ^myself^ entirely at the disposal of the servants of God to do with me, in this respect, as they will, and consequently I accept this duty, hoping that with the help of God I may be able to do some good in the capacity of a missionary. I will endeavor to be prepared to start upon the date that you have mentioned.Your Bro in the Gospel John M HendryO.K. J. F. S.
