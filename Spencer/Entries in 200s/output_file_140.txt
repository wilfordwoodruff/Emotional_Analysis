 Sacramento City Aug. 28th, 52Brother WilfordI wrote you a few days since in which I stated that those Bonds paid me by Col. Reese were worth only 7c cts. in the dollar and he gave me them at 8c cts. in the dollar. He wished me to keep them as long as I could which I have done as he supposed they would advance, and should they bring even 8c cts. per dollar I was to pay him back the amount and if they sold for any less than that he would make it up. They are now worth only 65 cts. and ^still at that^ I shall be obliged to sell them immediately as I take the steamer for N. Yuk on the 1st Sept. the amount he paid me in then was $1100 - the discount in that amount between 8 c ch. and 65 would be 165$ which I presume will be what I shall get for themThat amount $165 Mr. Reese must pay you so that it can be forwarded this fall.  should that amount not be right either way we will correct it.  The mail for Salt Lake some days so that I cannot be more definiteon the subject.  I shall hold them as directed by Col. Reese till the last moment which will be the 31st, inst I am sorry and feel quite disappointed that that matter is not closed up and hope it will be attended to immediately, that there will be no more delay on the part of Mr. Reese at the valley.Nothing new of interest with me.  please write me by next mail to the [Suters] saying how emegration is coming in.  The long letter of this mail to this placeI did not receive from you. Remember me very kindly to Mrs. Woodruff and the family  Sister Webster and all enquiring friends and believe me, in hasteVery truly YoursI. F. Carter

 [upside-down text] Mail carrier has arrived home not yet saw the Col. [end of upside-down text]Johnsons Ranch, six miles from [Plua]Aug 6th, 1852My Dear Sister and BrotherYour favor of July 4thwas handed me by the mail carrier and very welcome itwas I can assure you, I should have been highly gratifiedto have spent the 4th with you. Col. Reese was not at homehad gone to San Francisco. I am waiting here to see him on hisreturn, expecting him daily. California presents a dull anddismal appearance, this is the dullest season of the year inconsequence of the scarcity of water, many men are out of employment and cannot make one half enough to pay their board.As soon as I see the Col, I shall go to Sacramento City andsee what is to be done there, should I not be able to findsome favorable business will take the steamer by and by for N. YorkOur journey from Salt Lake was rather hard, however wegot along well, the last 400 miles are tough down theHumbolt and over the mountains. How very, very much Iwant to visit Salt Lake. I feel quite dissatisfied inleaving so soon. I feel much more interest in it now thanformerly, it appears to me that I hardly saw you at all evenafter going so long a distance for almost exclusively thatexpress business. Was it not for the great fatigue of the journeyacross the plains I would return that way but I possess hardly[usual] [cemaye] enough to undertake an other such trip.I was glad to hear that Dr. B. had paid that dept. Iwas not uneasy about it as it had Brother [Tamgs] name on itthat will be quite a help toward my settling my old affairs 
 [sideways text] I F Carter [end of sideways text]and a settlement of them is something. God knows that I greatlydesire. I am like a broken stick, of no account can do nothingno I desire. I feel it most deeply, and really hope thatsomething may turn up whereby I may extricate myselfI do not desire great wealth, that is not my object, societyfriends and relatives I prize much higher, with a privilege ofliving just as we shall wish we had when we came to die.This has been my wish and determination for years past to do as nearwhat is right as possible, to do unto others just as I would haveanother do unto me, but we will do w[r]ong sometimes particularlywhen we are not under the influence of a higher power.I feel very thankful that I spent the last night as I did inSalt Lake, the influence is very great on me, many views of thechurch coincide with my aim, that is, all with which I am familiar, some I know nothing of, which I shall leave with time todetermine. We have had the advantages of a pious education,a pious Mother whose prayers have been long and frequent and fervent for our future happiness and hope we shall fullyappreciate them. I have been Providentially spared. I feel that I have not deserved such loving kindness from the hands of a Supreme Beingbut the mind is tempered to the slian lamb and I am I hope trulythankful for his recollections of my wants and circumstancesOn my way from this place to Sacramento I shall go bySalmon falls and try to find Calvin, hope he has been successfulI should like much to meet with something by which I couldmake a few thousand, this winter will be as favorable a timeas any I think to settle my old business should you be able tocollect something in those accounts and forward let us much aspossible be in American and foreign coin is the best I can do withvalley coin is 20 pr. ct. discount and many refuse it at thatthere is a man in N. York formerly from Baltimore that is owingme an important amount, was unfortunate in business, shouldI chance to get that I should be all right, hope sucha thing may phappen presume you see my letter from theplains by Brown. I shall expect a long letter from you by thenext mail judging from present appearances I may notremain long in California, will write again soon, please remember me to all our friends and believe meVery truly your friendI.

 I am of opinion he has gone on ^A^ mishion should he call on me I willinform him of your Desire we have a preacher laitly come among us andhe thus far teaches the morman faith holds to the gifts and grces of church he Holds to the unconccousness of the Dead and and that they remainso till the resurrectoion and then they the wicked receive their part inthat Lake that burns with fire & brimstone till they have paid the utmost farthing and Left nether root or branch burnt up Destroid anilated he teachesthat this earth will be the final home of saints when it is purified andbe^c^ombs a new earth where in dwesls righteousness he teaches that the Jewswill not be gathered till the end of the world that the tairs wood withe the wheat untill the harvest the man is James Cowles Walter H Cowles sonhe says he does not belond to any sect of or denomination he says the number of the beast is completed 666. the unconciousness of the Dead and the final aniihalation of the wicked he has not taught pubylickly.I want you to inform me into ^your^ faith and belief as far as the Lord will letyou I want to know all about you and the mormons it is thot by someof my neighbours that the mormons will after a little be rooted up againthat governor youngs does not conform to the general goverment thatsome of his doings is in opposition to the general goverent.

 Brother Azmon writes that god has set his hand to the work of gathering thescattered remnant of Israel and that we are living down under the sounding of the7 Angel and that the Kingsdoms of this world are alreddy given to Jesus Christ andthat he will soon break them with a rod of iron and dash them to pecesas a potters vessel that the vision of 2300 days (years) is ended and that thesanctuary is now being clensed and the 3rd angel of ##Revelations 14:9-12|Rev 14: 9-12## is now deliveringhis message of warning to the Laodiceans and all who are in reach of salvationand warning them against worshiping the Beast and his image andReceiving his mark he says he fully believes he says the sabbath of the fourthcom^m^and in the Seal of the Living god and the mark against which the 3rdangel of ##Revelations 14|14 Rev## warns us of reseiving under the no less penalty than ofdrinking the wine of the wrath of god is keeping the first day of the week [& on]sabbath he says the Parable of the ten Virgins is fulfuled and the wiseVirgin have gone in to the marriage and the Door is shut  [##Matthew 25##] the Deathis Lovely street since you was here are 25 or near as can rememberI have buried my son Henry aged 18 years I have got to be greatgrand father a bright little daughter I am 64 years old enjoy good healthI see the want of my right thumb but can tend saw mill verry wellBill Cowles sends his respects to Aphek and says he is but 73 or 74 yearsold he has his second wife he maried a woman that has had 5 husbandshe makes the 6th enjoys himself well sister Hellen is well and familyCozen Abi Thompson has lost 2 sons 2 years past she has been mariedthe second time but he is dead his name Luke Case Titus and femely is wellCozen Thaddeas Thompson is well and family he has has lost his oldest daughter agedabout 18 years at is a general time of health among us you must be tiredof my scribling by this time and I must bid you A diue Remember me inyour prayers that the blessing of heaven may rest on you and your familyand all the Israel of god is the prayer of your weak Brother Ozem Woodruff

 Elder W. Woodruff, spoke of the necessity of the Revelation of God being given to this people for 40 years back to guide them but the most difficult part for us to become united in is not our temporal affairs  40 years last November since the Saints was drove out of Jackson County Mo: and that  because they would not be controlled in their Temporal affairs. And Presd B. Young Sr. has commence at the very time the 40 years is upto begin to enter into this United Order and he turned the Keys at that time and it will increase and increase untill like the waves of the sea it will eventualy overwelm all before it and there needs no long argument to convice us that the time has come for our Heavenly Father to call upon us to make a move in this direction and have you any thing in this world that is before the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and we are required to unite together and offer our all upon the Alter
