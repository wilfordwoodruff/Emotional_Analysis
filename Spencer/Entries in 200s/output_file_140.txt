Have enclosed a fort containing 19 acre &amp; 96 rods of ground and have ploughed &amp; sewed about  1000 acres of wheat have fenced about 6000 acres of land Have built one saw mill and got a Cooncel House up the 1 story.

A meeting was called at 4 oclock to ascertain the minds of the Brethren it was found  about 30 wished to go home 15 to get their families &amp; the other 15 to remain at the great salt Lake each one made there excuse President Young then addressed them &amp; said he would express  his feelings upon the subject to those who wished to go home If you were now on a mission to England or any other  part of the Earth preaching the gospel you would not sit down  &amp; council together about going to get your families or go  home untill your mission was ended. this is of quite as  much importance as preaching the gospel for the time has now  come when it is required of us to make the wilderness blos- som as the rose. Our mission now is build up stakes of Zion  &amp; fill these mountains with cities &amp; when your mission  is ended you are at Liberty to go &amp; be free &amp; ownly do right. When I go on a mission I leave my affairs in the hands of  God. If my house fields, flocks, wife or children die in my  absence I say Amen to it. If they live &amp; prosper I feel to say Amen to it &amp; thank the Lord. He wished the Brethren  to finish the fort &amp; secure their grain &amp;c wished the land to be surveyed so that the Brethren who laid the foundation could have their choice of farms. He councelled the Brethren to buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could &amp;  educate them &amp; teach them the gospel so that not many generations they would be a white &amp; delightsom people for the Lord could not have devised a better plan than  to have put us whare we are in order to accomplish this  thing    ENDENTRY May 13, 1851    E. T. Benson in the morning who spoke lengthy in the afternoon the meeting was addressed By J M Grant &amp; W Woodruff who expressed their feelings upon various subj- ects B Young followed and advised to have the logs so close  that arrows could not be shot into the fort. He would prefer to have many address the saints so as to get Ideas from many than  to have one occupy all the time.

If we begin right  we shall go right if we begin wrong we shall keep wrong the United States are afraid of our union &amp; so is the world In speaking of the Indians he said these Indians were the  descendants of the old gadianton robers who infested these  mountains for more than a thousand years.    amid the roar of cannon &amp; drove to red creek &amp; camped  for the night.

If a man is unrighteously  angry he should let it sleep &amp; not show itself untill he is right again. good men may be left to commit a gross sin but if he had watched closely he would have escaped the evil. the Lord intends all men to be tryed in this life &amp; if you build   ENDENTRY  All men have an oppertunity of appearing wise or foolish  of governing themselves or making their folley manifest  Peter commit a gross error had he have been on the watch tower he might have turned away in silence &amp; not denyed his  Lord.

Others have been blinded &amp;  overcome &amp; done evil then their eyes were open to see the conseq- uences. But it is the privilege of all men to live so that they  can see what each act will amount to either good or evil How  different the prospect would be before the world or this people if they would live so from what it now is. I endeavour to do right  in all things &amp; then leave the event in the hands of God &amp; am satisfy  with the result. If a man is led or tempted to do a thing that you do not comprehend the result of &amp; that result ^not^ lead to good then let it alone.    ions last sunday ought to be observed &amp; was good but it ought to have  been spoken in the right spirit. But I wish to say that I am  satisfyed with the power &amp; influence the Lord has given me. The Lord  directs things according to his own will, I know my feelings &amp; zeal  would make my words like a sharp two edged sword so that they  would seperate the sins from this people that they should practice  sin no more not be tempted with it but this is not the will  of God the people still must have their warfare &amp; trial &amp; if the storms &amp; waves overwhelm the ship still all is well for we have a good captain at the helm. Some people are vary anxious to reprove others while they are wrong themselves and do not know the spirit they are of the do Peter &amp; Judas Jesus, &amp; How do you do Mr Devil And are  vary pious but will go to Hell with their spirit &amp; the whole  world will go to Hell with the same spirit Awake ye Elders  of Israel &amp; make your calling &amp; election sure lest you go to  Hell with the wicked, I do not point you to the sectarian  Hell whare Devils are tosting you with a pitchfork in the  billows of Hell fire eternally. But go &amp; mingle with the wicked in the states wrangle &amp; fight with them get their spirit  &amp; feelings &amp; loose the light &amp; spirit of God &amp; you will begin  to feel the true state of the Damned. The wicked killed  Jesus Christ out of mallace &amp; wickedness &amp; they did not  know that His death was to save the world the Lord turns many things for good which the world means for Evil the whole Earth is filled with misery, sin &amp; wickedness I  could find no worse Hell than to be confined among them I labour for the welfare of this whole people I wish my  Brethren to be a happy free people that their course of life may be such as to get an Eternal &amp; temperal salvation  I labour to effect this, their is time &amp; change to all things  Their has been a code of Laws given in former days which was for all people which is the gospel of Jesus Christ  In the da to preach the gospel &amp; warn the people they did so but were  then martered for preaching it &amp; the saints were killed off the Earth, that time is gone the change has come, for now   ENDENTRY  strength power &amp; glory to gather Israel to build Jerrusalem &amp; Zion to fight for our liberty &amp; freedom. we have sent the Gospel forth &amp; preached the Book of Mormon and the minstry  of Jesus on this continent in Ancient days Now the time is come to gather Israel &amp; polish them. Their is a great excitement in  the world about abolition we shall have the Negro or Indian as  few that were prisioners that we have bought to save their lives  but what will the Abolitionest do If you owe them a dollar they  will Jog you up. Neither will they liberate the slave by buying  them &amp; setting them free. The Master of Slaves will be damned  if they Abuse their slaves. Yet the seed of Ham will be  servants untill God takes the curse off from them but they are  not all the slaves their is in the world. The whole world are  slaves to sin &amp; wickedness &amp; passion. Blacks  they are as free as I am. Shall we lay a foundation for  Negro Slavery No God forbid and I forbid. I say let  us be free. we will be rich but we must be rich in  faith first or we shall be rich in no other way. we must lay a foundation to manufacture our own goods if we do  not we shall be slaves to our enemies we must stop being  so much dependant oupon our enemies &amp; a foreign market  or it will make us trouble and this people must sceace getting in debt to the merchants for if you will get in debt you  shall pay your debts but I say stop getting in debt let No one come to me &amp; complain that he has got in debt &amp; the  man will sue him &amp; ought to be cut off from the church  for you that get in debt &amp; wont pay your debts are the ones that ought to be cut off from the church. dont get in debt  go in the spring &amp; get the bark off the shrub oaks their is enough  in this valley to tan $200,000 worth of leather, &amp; here your  h for leather &amp; you pay the merchants $80,000 annually for shoes  but instead of persueing this course if you will lay a foundation  for taning leather making cloth making what we want you  then lay a foundation to build &amp; sustain Zion. I drove sheep  to this valley &amp; bought others &amp; brought a carding machine  here to card wool who will put it up I have done more to  stock this valley than any 4 men in the place. I want  others to do sumthing set up the mashine &amp; make the cloth is there  any woman in this valley who will make me a suit of clothes  so if I do not wear them. what is the spirit of the times  in the world if a woman pays a great price for an article  it is considered vary nice &amp; all want some of the same but you get a thing cheap &amp; all are ashamed to wear it you are looked  upon with disdain but if you pay a great price you are vary  respectable. their is many practices not right to see the men  ride through the streets they go as though they were in a hurry  to get to Hell. To men of wisdom such things look vain &amp; foolish but to the world it looks glorious &amp; the mark of fellow with them is fine clothing &amp; splendor, I want the saints to  adorn themselves first their hearts with faith &amp; grace then their bodies with the workmanship of their own hands if  it is silk &amp; satin all the better it will show your art   ENDENTRY  not known on the Earth if it is not among this people But the  friendship of this people is the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ this must continue to improve untill they are perfect    their had not Been $200 dollars paid in cash during the  past Year  merchants $200000 in cash, &amp; their is now 30000 bushels  of wheat due on tithing.

Dont you want a building to meet in to worship God  we want a Tabernacle, &amp; a Temple for our Endowments  also a Tower to hang a bell on &amp; we want to keep building up Zion that Israel may have a place of rest. if we do this we do our duty we have duties to perform and a warfare to accomplish but the victory will soon be ours the greatest  warfare is with ourselves if we can gain a victory with  ourselves so as to have peace with ourselves our wives &amp; childn  we shall do well. many other interesting remarks were  made by the president.     in an adifying manner.

I want to speak such things as are  in my heart. All that are acquainted with me know that my religion embraces all things that belong to the duties of life  The Religion I have embraces all the principles of present  future, progressive &amp; Eternal Salvation in evry sens of the  word. I labour for the salvation of myself &amp; my Brethren I would  be glad to speak to thousands even the whole world if they could  hear I would not like to preach in this house to 20 or 100 persons when more than 1000 could get in here then for 20 or  &amp; have to preach 20 or 50 times to have the people learn when  they could learn it all at once. The President of the Seventies  called a separate meeting to day I come &amp; dismissed it what if the  Twelve Seventies High Priest, Elders, priest, Teachers, Deacon &amp; member should do the same there would be bear walls for the house to  preach to &amp; what Good would it do. If the presidency of the seventies have such important things to lay before the quorum as to get them to -gether on sunday let them come &amp; teach us all. I now want to  give council in this matter from this time forth &amp; forever let  not the president of any quorum ever again call a separate meeting  from the public congregation unless the president of the Church  it. The seventies should be here and all the people should be here  let the seventies Hall go &amp; all other business when Sunday comes   ENDENTRY  Apply your hearts unto wisdom &amp; get it. If I am full of  the spirit of God I shall not get any more than I want  It is the duty of all to come here that can come &amp; let the  power of Eternity rest upon us and you should not be asleep  but wide awake. When I contrast the present with the past  situations of the Saints It gives me a great variety of feelings, both good &amp; bad Joyful &amp; sorrowful I have seen this people waiding through a school of affliction they then  were prayful &amp; had faith their trying situation made  them remember the Lord their God. But now prosperity  is heaped upon you and as this people are to be tryed in all  things when prosperity comes some forget God wax fat  &amp; rich do not realize the blessings they are enjoying. some  who are in poverty abroad desire to gather with the saints  when they arive &amp; get rich they forget what they have  been. Could you see the feelings of thousands now  who are abroad who desire with all their hearts to come  here they would be willing to lick up the dust of your feet  if they could but be here they still are with the wicked  Bring them here they look upon many who were poor  but now rich, they then desire to be rich also they want  gold &amp; will soon be willing to sacrifice the society of the  Saints &amp; go to the gold mines &amp; plunge themselves again into Hell as it were from whare they came to gratify an  unlawful desire thus it is with many men some were  to go to the Bear River &amp; keep a ferry to get gold  &amp; wait on wicked ungodly men to get gold whare are  their minds like the fools eyes. I told them I would  not wait on the devils for loads of gold I would rather stay here &amp; serve the Lord. All I want of property is to serve the Lord &amp; build up his kingdom with it. I suppose  many of the Brethren &amp; Sisters are much tryed to think  they cannot have all they want. I will tell you what  to do, do all you can to day &amp; let the rest go untill to morrow  do your duty to day and all will be right what  good would it do you to have 999 years to search &amp; hear the revelations  &amp; commandments of God if we have no time to carry one of  them out. If any one wants to get more revelations than they  improve upon they are greedy dogs. It will take 20 years to do the  work that God has revealed through the mouth of his servant  Joseph which he laid out for us to perform before his death  even during the last year of his life to say nothing of what he  gave before. I will tell you your duty. Command your minds from evry thing that is not for you to day &amp; sit &amp; worship God  not sit &amp; sleep but worship the Lord today, go home at the close  of the meeting &amp; get your food &amp; rest then come to meeting again ponder &amp; reflect upon the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ &amp; his sufferi- ngs. if their is any thing necessary to be done do it if an ox or an  ass falls into the pit pull him out, drive any beast out of your Neigh bors grain &amp; put up the fence. Do you meditate do you pray in  your families &amp; in secret to get the spirit of God. you say you have  come here to meeting on Monday morning go through my field leave  my fence down let their cattle &amp; horses eat my wheat   ENDENTRY  got &amp; that to without liberty &amp; never bring it home and if  it was not my duty to stay here I would lay my hands  upon some I could pick out who I have confidence in &amp; would go &amp; form a colony by myself &amp; would not admit of any person who was not proven I cannot get grass in the Big field but many of you do it. But I now warn you not to  steal my wood nor any of my property for if you continue  to do it I will put a mark upon such men that they will carry all the days of their lives they are hypocritts and  think all others are the same I dont love them vary well Again I say to you it is not your duty to get in debt to these Merchants I say you shall pay your debts if you say you cant pay I say you shall pay them.    Brethren you may ask shall we forgive our Brother his trespas if he repents I say yes "How many times untill seventy times seven in one day if he repents &amp; asks for it even all sins except the sin against the Holy Ghost. If you will bring back my tools grass &amp; grain which you have taken unlawfully or any of my property and ask forgiveness I will  off any man untill he cast himself off I will not reject any  man untill he rejects himself, I will hold on to any man as long as he has any prospect of salvation.

I have had to deliver my discourses in few words. I wish the people to sustain the priesthood as the priesthood. As to the opin- ion of men concerning myself as a man I care no more about it than I do the dust under my feet. I dont care what you  say about me If you will ownly serve the Lord our God do the people live so as to know the voice of the Good shepherd. I wish to state one item here which concerns you seriously, that is concerning the Indians here. They are Ignorant have been taught to steel  &amp; kill from their childhood &amp; those who could do the most of it were considerd the greatest Braves &amp; chiefs as soon as they begin to steal  here many of you want them killed compare their circumsta nces with your own. You are taught from your cradles not to steal or kill as it is a great crime now do you kill a white man as soon as he steals weigh this subject well. Those who wish them killed for stealing a horse reduce themselves far below the Indian. You love them as well as I do, but when the curse is taken off they will again be fit for society but while they  are in their degraded state it rests upon us to use wisdom &amp;  judgment in their behalf. I say to the saints kill evry white  man you see stealing &amp; not kill the Indian for it for the white men  know better. I speak to the saints not as the Govornor of Utah but you &amp; I are sent to save Israel not to kill them. Evry Elder that croses a certain line I do not wish to see him but those who do right or seek to do right if they commit an error we will forgive them I do not ask for influence ownly what God gives me neither will I give any man influence ownly what the Lord &amp; his own good   ENDENTRY  all els will be of no use to him. If I do the work of God  well but I will give no man influence ownly what God gives A Few words to families who have not a head to Govern will be destroyed. The man is the head of the family &amp; should govern it. the hand may say to the head if I really thought you would govern right I would be governed by you but I am afraid you will not and I want to govern you &amp; dictate the head then the shoulders &amp; stomach will want to dictate but does not good sens teach you that your head should Govern your body your experience teaches the same. Your head dictates you what to do &amp; when your head  dictates the body to do wickedly &amp; pollute the body then the head should be cut off so as not to pollute the body any longer    act unless the belly told the head what to do. In the strict sens of the word no man is qualifyed to be judge &amp; rule in the priesthood  untill he is qualifyed to rule himself, &amp; be king over himself it is thus in families children &amp; mothers Have you a good Husband &amp; Father let the wife rule the Husband &amp; she will keep him tied to the dish cloth &amp; kitchen all the days of his life &amp; it proves a curse upon him. Their is a curse upon man that  I would not take off if I could for in the experience you have you are led to salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ    your feelings as men have to do &amp; be mystress of your house I go to the house to rest the Mother sayes I cannot govern the children I wish you would but this is not right the Elders of this church have to go abroad to preach the gospel they cannot be with their children when they come home to spend a little time they want to daudle their children upon their knee &amp; not go to whiping them the Mother should govern them  let the Father Govern I can govern my children when  they are with me I would rather one of my sons would stab me to the heart &amp; kill me dead than to conquer &amp;  master me in government when any undertake to  govern out of their place they do not prosper. As an ensample John Taylor undertook to govern &amp; controll &amp; set right my affairs at winter Quarters while I was on  a pioneer Journey to the Mountains &amp; they liked to have destro yed many but I said peace be still and I saved the people I say to Mothers in the Name of the Lord God of Israel do your  duty dont ask the Father to whip the child do it yourself if  necessary &amp; let Mothers controll their daughters untill they go to their Husbands, but let the Man rule &amp; preside over his household and I say to the Men do not go home &amp; abuse your wives becaus of what I have said but treat them kindly what would you think of a man who would get up before a glass &amp; cut &amp; tear his own heart out as well of him as I would  of a man who would beat &amp; abuse his wife.     if we keep the commandments &amp; do right we have a Heaven within us all the time 40 Men &amp; all the devils in Hell cannot make a Hell for us if we do right but if you stop to parley with the devil he will soon get the advantage over you &amp; make a Hell for you   ENDENTRY  taught us much to our edifycation. The spirit should controll the body the monitor whispers to the mind of man when it does  &amp; sayes this is wrong points out the right path &amp; sayes walk ye in it the soul or spirit of man wants feeding as well as the body or it  will dry up &amp; wither like the quakers &amp; other sects    can stand in the society of the gods, then let us do right &amp; keep the commandments of God in all things. Our knowledge comes by experience it is Necessary that we should have crosses &amp; trials of all kinds  in order to gain knowledge by experience if we overcome we  get a great victory continue to do so untill we arive at our high  stations to become Gods Organize worlds &amp; controle them. All our passions God gave us but we must controll them &amp; make a right use of them. Our spirits were pure from Eternity but  condescended to take a body in its impure state was married  to it will continue with it through time in mortality through  Eternity in Immortality. In speaking of the married state sayes if man &amp; wife become alliniated from each other it is in one sens the spirit of adultery    ENDENTRY June 16, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY June 21, 1851    cattle &amp; at hard labour    ENDENTRY June 22, 1851    follows. If I can see the motives of the heart of man &amp; know  Eternal things by the spirit of God it is far more beautiful  than to hear the &amp; convers with any man in the congregation No other one might know it. He would think the person spoke to him as one speaks to another face to face when he would not be seen at all ownly by the spirit of God or by vision. we may know by the spirit of God what is in a mans heart before he speaks, at all times listen  to the still small voice of the spirit of God and it will save the saints from many snares. If you get angry dont sin nor let the sun go down upon your wrath I do not expect perfection in men  not what the world calls perfection I have seen a perfect prophet and perfect Apostles, that is perfect in their calling. But not the perfection the world looks for. If Joseph had been as perfect as the people wished him to be he could not have lived with the people nor stayed this side of the veil as long as he did, we could not have herd his voice nor seen his face. He would have had to been veiled Israel could not endure the face of Moses at times. The Lord exp- ects us to be in the path of Duty when we get in Eternity we shall be Angels or Goods we shall their advance to the God head  if we do right.    what is the Law to those who do right. It is not made for any body but the transgresser &amp; lawless &amp; wicked. If we do not infringe upon the rights of others all things are ours in Heaven &amp; Earth time &amp; Eternity Life &amp; Death Heaven Earth &amp; Hell &amp; all that is therein is ours if we do not infringe upon the rights of any other being we shall become Gods &amp; fill immensity as our Father in Heaven does I can weigh all the sleepers philosophers, &amp; Learned men of the Earth in the scale &amp; know just what they weigh &amp; can cir cumscribe them all. All is mine Heaven Earth, Hell wives children   ENDENTRY  the stakes are set to Gods immensity. Take the world at large and they get to the end of their chain when they get to the mill  pond. It is a startling Idea to think we are worshiping a God  that once was  they had to pass through a probation of pain, suffering &amp; the fall like ourselves &amp; He made perfect through sufferings. The Son of God passed through it &amp; the Father would not require of a son  what He would not do Himself. All our sufferings will exhalt us in the presence of God if we endure them patiently. A word of advice concerning lawing I dont never want to hear of another law suit among the Brethren. Is it anything but good common sense to Never have another suit before a judge to say nothing of revelation. It does not require any great perfection to  accomplish this, let men do right do your Neighbour good not evil. The Lord will burn up the Earth to cleanse it as you would an old pipe. You think it hard to have to water your land here but it is far more healthy than to have rain it was so in Egypt if it did not rain in Missouri more than here it would be far more healthy this could be reasoned out on Natural  principles. A word more upon Law suits their would not be a Lawsuit in this valley if all men would do right &amp; were saints but the net has gathered all kinds good bad &amp; worse let twelve men get drunk in this community &amp; it ruins the place in the estimation of of good men we have to bear the character of the drunkard a few stinking fish in the net defile it. &amp; the whole net stinks and it creates a prejudic against it. Those who were acq- uainted with Joseph know that if he delt any in temporal  things it created a prejudice against him. He bought many goods to help carry on the public works but the people were ready to get it all away from him. So it is now but I say unto  all men who are saints put to your hands &amp; help build up Zion &amp; the Kingdom of God we are scholars in the great school &amp; must  learn we are a kingdom &amp; must bring the kingdom in subjection to the will of God    ENDENTRY June 23, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY June 28, 1851       ENDENTRY June 29, 1851    with the Brethren I wish to be a doer of the word I feel the import ance of the remarks of the last speaker Brother Spencer those who are not ready to meet the Bridegroom will not be invited  to the supper and the time is near. Jesus Christ is an ensam- ple to all Saints, He was filled with wisdom in his youth but in his childhood &amp; infancy He was like other children. It has  been said that He was in infancy wise as in manhood but this is not the case He was subject to temptation as we are but was not overcome by it. If we have become acquainted with our follies let us put them away &amp; apply our hearts unto wisdom. let us have  compassion on others as we wish God to have compassion  on us we should increase in wisdom untill the day of redemption No person can receive all at once but increase little by little untill the day of perfection. Apply our hearts to wisdom &amp; it will produce peace, health, wealth &amp; evry good thing. should you see a people carry out the principles of wisdom peace would be the fruit &amp;   ENDENTRY  Ask the world if they do not like a people who live in peace &amp; are  contented &amp; they will say yes it is beautiful take the world at  the present time &amp; they are like wolves eat each other up they  fight &amp; contend &amp; devour each other the abolitionest become heated  &amp; say the Negro must be made equal to the white man at the table &amp; all other places they will at the same time turn away the widow &amp;  orphan &amp; put into prision a poor man for debt, and deprive him of his time to pay the debt, instead of this we should feed the  hungry &amp; do good to all men as we have an opportunity  then we have a Zion it is peace in the heart we should  bear an evil from a Friend as well as an Enemy you ask the  Lord to bear with your infirmities so we should bear with  each other. what is the necessity of doing wrong having law suits &amp; contending with each other go to Law &amp; spend $100 to collect $5. you may be told you are independent &amp; have rights  you have a right to do good &amp; not evil. The God I serve will  deal out good to his saints &amp; evry thing that is necessary  for them &amp; reveal his will unto them, &amp; teach them what  to do He will not lie or decieve me I will ask O Lord  did you do this or that did you bless this man or that man  so &amp; so or did you suffer that evil to be so &amp; so yes I  have done this to try men so &amp; so, do you want me to do  so &amp; so. If I am going to do a thing I ask is it the will of  God if I cannot get the will of God upon it I refuse to do it lest I do a thing wrong, we want to do right then we  prosper. is the people doing right is the kingdom growing is their principles in this kingdom to govern all men with  All that the Nations of the Earth Now possess would not make  this people happy as they now are. Give us the kingdom of God  instead of the glories of the world. their has been a great stir to  exhalt the Negro &amp; make him equal to the white man but  there is a curse upon the seed of Cain &amp; all Hell cannot wipe  it out &amp; it cannot be taken off untill God takes if off  when a person unlawfully seeks for power &amp; exhaltation  by taking the blessings which belongs to another he will  sink far below the other. As Lucipher the son of the morning sought the glory that belonged to Christ the first born  He was thrust down to Hell. so Cain sought Abels blessi- ng &amp; took the life of his brother the consequence was  Cain was cursed &amp; his seed &amp; this curse will remain  untill Abels posterity will get all the blessing their is  for him then the curse may be taken from Cain or  his posterity but his posterity will be below Abels. All are slaves Polititions are the worst slaves and if we dont do right we shall ketch the lash we are the freest  people on Earth. Queen Victoria is a slave had to ask  the liberty to marry prince Albert but we are free we have  the right God &amp; kingdom let  or our Brethren if we do we shall sink below them &amp; their  children. If the wife dishonors the Husband the children will dishonor the Mother &amp; she must welter under it  Honour the priesthood in all its parts. Be more faithful be  more prudent.

The company  organized at the Temple square &amp; started at 9 oclok in the  morning to take a ride to the great Salt Lake their was about  140 carriages of waggons besides the Horsemen the car  containing the Band of Musicions was drawn by 16 mules we  arived at the rock on the Lake at 2 oclock A.M p.m. we had  a meeting was addressed by Govornor Young &amp; several  Orators who spoke much to the edifycation of the people in  the evening many went into the salt lake to bathe at 10 oclk the signal was given for prayers when all assembled in  the carrell or circle and prayer was offered up before  God &amp; the encampment retired to rest we were 24 miles  from the city    ENDENTRY July 5, 1851    we returned to the City of the Great Salt Lake in the same  Order that we came out.

If we speak  incorrect we should be corrected we want to speak free that  we may gather good whether it is in the past present or to  come Brother Kempton has been speaking. He professes to  be a scholar I do not, but he has murdered the English language  today I want speakers to speak the English language correctly  for our children sake. As to principles their is no principles  in Heaven Earth or Hell but what the Saints have to appley to  their proper place. If we could understand all things we should know that here is the place to begin to make the people happy if we could understand the dealings &amp; providences of God  with us &amp; the object of it their would not be the discontent  &amp; murmerings of the people that their now is but we should  have peace  &amp; temporal things I would say that temporal &amp; spiritual  things are one but what we call temporal are the courser  things which we see with our Eyes but the finer or spiritual  things we cannot see with our Eyes unless they are touched  by the spirit of God. Then we could see spiritual things to say the spiritual eye cannot see temporal things is folly but it looks unnatural to see people put out their own eyes to  spite their Neighbor. Anciently God Angels &amp; Eternal things   ENDENTRY  clothed with the spirit of God that my Eyes cannot. In speaking of Hell it is called vary hot but our God is a consumeing fire. Hell is here it is said the devil was  cast down to the Earth also that he was cast down to Hell He is in our midst striveing to lead captive the children of men I want the Brethren to speak freely to speak all that is in you &amp; if you have an Error let it out &amp; exchange it for true principle. some of the Saints  want more Revelation mysteries, great things, but do they know what  they ask for or what they have already got if the request of many men  was granted it would be like casting pearles before swine they would trample them in the mire we have enough now of the key words &amp; tokens to take us through the veil into the celestial world &amp; lead us to the Throne of God, &amp; what more do you want. Have you ever pondered in  your hearts by visions &amp; the spirit of God Eternal things even the redeeming of all worlds from there down to the smallest things God has made Have  you ever reflected upon the great system of salvation of the creatures  of God Is man contented He is not. Can man alter the decrees of God concerning the seed of Abraham or any thing els He cannot why not quarrel about Christ coming instead of the Father when the Father appointed Jesus Christ the first born to come &amp;  redeem the Earth there was contention got up the second brother Lucipher the son of the morning He wanted the honour to come &amp; redeem  the Earth but Christ was the Appointed one it was his right by appoin tment &amp; birthright. But the war &amp; contention became so hot &amp; the  influence of Lucipher was so great that he got one third of the hosts of Heaven to Join his standard &amp; when he was hurled down to Hell like lightning from Heaven one third was cast down with him whare is he &amp; those that were cast down, with those spirts that accompanied him they are here on this Earth and they have blinded the child ren of men &amp; still seeking to overthrow the kingdom of God He is a thorn in the flesh to the children of God but this is all right &amp; we should be contented with what God sees fit to grant unto us &amp; to contented with our lot. If the devil had been contented &amp; acted in  his place he would not have been thrust down to Hell. Any man who seeks to do a thing that he cannot do &amp; should not do it cast him  into Hell &amp; makes a Hell for him when men ask for things that  does not belong to him &amp; it makes him unhappy. But do what  God wants you to do &amp; wait on those who are above you &amp; all  will be right. why did not one of the Apostles quarrel with  Jesus Christ to redeem the world Jesus set a little child in  their midst &amp; said if ye do not become as this little child you  cannot enter into the kingdom of God. If you would be the  greatest man in the kingdom of God you must be the greatest slave  or servant you will do more than any other man. The Apostles  did not quarrel to know who should or should not be president why do I or you not quarrel because we were not Joseph Smith to  accomplish. Evry man has his lot appointed him &amp; he should be  contented with it. Their is the work of God, Angels, men &amp; Devils  Is the Bible good the Book of Mormon Doctrins &amp; Covenants yes they are good those Book contain the words of God Angels men &amp; Devils. And if you dont want to be in Hell all the time be contented with your lot if you dont learn to be contented you will be in  Hell with Brother Kempton who sayes he was in Hell one year   ENDENTRY  because you are not God, Jesus Christ, an Angel, Brigham a man, a woman a Father a Mother, a son a daughter or  any thing els but be contented with the lot in which God has placed you then you will be happy &amp; blessed. The Blacks cannot  take the curse off themselves untill God takes it off make all  men saints &amp; they will treat each other well.

He is not able to handle the scriptures &amp; know all the spirits in the world as some can when the dark sayings in the scriptures are understood they are plain. The scripture here that speaks of Abrams bosom is not as given by Br  Kempton Abram is in paradise Lazarus is with him ##Luke 16:20-25## for me to explain is to tell the truth a man that feels &amp;  talks to the people should be a Bible of himsel if a man that   ENDENTRY  teach the people without quoting the teachings of others altogether is a blind guide &amp; will go to Hell with those he leads. It is the intenti- on of the Lord to teach men principle in progression untill he  shall know all things, that he may arise through faith power &amp; victory untill they obtain evry good thing even to arise  to be Gods even the Sons of God which blessing we cannot obtain without experience we should not sin when we are  tryed &amp; tempted but overcome which will give us glory  honor &amp; eternal life as fast as I improve upon what I have more will be given me. The Saviour was subject to all that we were  from his birth to his death. He applyed his heart unto wisdom we should do so to apply our hearts unto wisdom from day to  day and you will receive all that He did. If I through out  all that is in me what faults I have will give place for truth  &amp; that is good I feel to praise the Name of God for all  He has done for me. My heart is like Aminidab continually all persons see times when they wish truth to prevail. Mormonism is all t it forth &amp; esstablished it. He was faithful unto death &amp; sealed  his testimony with his blood. A certain prophecy sayes when  the Book of Mormon shall come unto the gentile the Jews shall  be gathered at Jerrusalem. All truth is ours in Heaven Earth &amp; Hell it is all the truth we want. But does the church or Elders  want correcting yes for they have errors &amp; fals botions the net  has all kinds of fish we have some as cursed rascals among  us as dwell on the Earth and we find Evil here as well as any  whare els. Yet Zion is here it is in my heart peace dwells  with me &amp; good principles will prevail Here untill all evil is overcome even in all the Earth let no man find fault with  his Neighbor untill He is righteous I dont ask any thing of others that I wont do myself and never find fault with  another about any thing you allow in yourself dont you sware, scold, &amp; do wrong yourself then dont find fault with another for it untill you subdue your own passions  &amp; the Evil that is in yourself some will do any thing to preside over another when they cannot preside over  themselves.

We are all as it were painters painting our own characters and evry good deed will give our sign a  white coulor &amp; evry wicked deed a black colour &amp; when we have painted unto the End of our days our character will be  presented before God in its true light &amp; we shall see as we are seen &amp; know as we are known some think the Judgment will not be untill after the resurrection of some thousands of years but remember that when you lie down at night &amp; are weary and fall asleep before you are aware of it the morning comes the time is past &amp; you are awoke. But in the church &amp; kingdom of God what is sealed on Earth is sealed in Heaven what is bound on Earth is bound in Heaven and if a man sins he is soon brought into Judgment for now is the Judgment  with him. God will Judge the world but He may not Judge one individual Himself but His servants will Judge them under his  direction. It is said the saints will Judge Angels but what Angels why fallen Angels for those Angels who remain in Heaven are now above us while those who are fallen are below us for who is better able to Judge them than the Saints who  cast them out. Many other interesting remarks were made by Elder Hyde.    good and I will apply them and I want all to lift up their  sign and I want to imitate the best painted sign in Israel  &amp; the character that is most like God I never expect to see a time in all Eternity but what I shall have to abide a law  be trimmed &amp; scourged untill I am a fit subject to become a  God. If you get into Heaven &amp; rebell you will be cast out their is always danger of falling as long as we are going up a  ladder.

ENDENTRY  you should do so, we are  us sit here &amp; worship God &amp; let our business rest &amp; let us reflet  a little &amp; exercise ourselves in our religion let our houses rest &amp;  farms &amp; crops let the people be still &amp; not talk in the house or about the  window. In my meditations I am like other men who reflet and I marvel to see men so intent upon objects that  will so soon perish. How many their are here who ask the  question how long will this Conference last I want to go I cannot  stop and others will be willing to stop &amp; worship God some  spirits are like the troubled sea uneasy. If I could have my  wish about it I would wish such spirits to pass out of our  midst leave the congregation &amp; let us worship in peace. We  are such an industrious people that we could not commence  conference untill Sunday. I care as little about our gardens  farms lumber &amp;c as you do about snuffing ashes. If you get  all the riches of the world you cannot Hold them. If you will  get the wisdom it is your privilege to possess you will know  that God cares more for you than the ravens if you seek  the Kingdom of God &amp; its righteousness the Lord will add  all things els that is necessary. Our first duty is to  provide for our families but we must take a course to accom plish it. Fools are often rich &amp; the wise in begery this is the  providence of God we may be ever so rich to day we may be beggars to morrow thise is the case with those who are before  me let me draw the line between the Good &amp; Evil Have you not had more good than Evil more than you would had if you had been in  the world more peace than in the world &amp; happiness  of the things of God than in the world yes you have then shame on  the man who complains of his hardship the worst persecutions of the  people are their best days. I went to Mo in 1834 walked 2000 miles in  70 days was so weak I could not step over the fence 3 feet high. I now  have better health &amp; strength than ever before I would  Geauga County for the experience I have had in 6 months. Now stay  here dont go home untill conference Ends. Many of the Saints forget  mormonism any body who Enjoy the light of the revelations of  Jesus Christ must have the spirit of God the FIGURE key to mormonism  is all the truths their is all Eternity that was ever revealed or ever will be that exhists with God Angels or men. whare shall I  go to Find truth in Mormonism. If you get a truth any whare it  is there as that covers all truth when the light came to me  sin did not revive in me and I died but I revived &amp; lived I  had not consented to the death of any good man like Stephen as Paul did. But let him come to any of the Churches reared  in honour to his name &amp; the world would kill him if they could  I will ask you are you excepted accepted of the Father &amp; Son you will say I dont know, well it is because your minds are taken up with the things of the world then let us stay here untill we do know  I am a Mormon or what is called so and I know that Joseph  was a prophet. It was revealed to me long before his death  I always thought while reading the Bible about a prophet that I  would go around the world to see one or any man who knew things as they were &amp; not have to guess at them. Evry thing will have  to bow to Mormonism or Eternal light &amp; truth we have the true  government of all the Earth I know the path this people has to walk   ENDENTRY  than Joseph Smith ever lived on the Earth. Hear it O ye Heavens  O ye Earth and all men this is my testimony that he is  man as ever lived save Jesus. The world will not vote for  a man because his religion governs they will not have God govern  them because of their cursed meanness but if God did not or can not deal    of God as they were revealed to them others believe on their testimony  the servants of God bind &amp; seal on Earth &amp; it is bound &amp; sealed in Heaven I bear testimony that we have a prophet that will hold  the keys of the kingdom of God through all Eternity also a Patriarch both have sealed their testimony with their blood  for the cause &amp; kingdom of God Mormonism is true &amp; the keys of the kingdom of God are with you the presidency of the church who  now live with us and are righteous men the Twelve, High priest,  High Council, Seventies &amp; Elders of Israel are righteous men  Joseph said we went into the little End of the Horn &amp; came out  of the big End of the Horn. Any thing is ours if we are faithful &amp; do the will of the Lord.    periods of my life. The testimony of all is good if the Brethren  who have spoken have broaken a clean loaf still I may gather  few crumbs we are living in the most important age and  when the Greatest events are to take place evry thing is on the  move the testimony of this work will go through the Earth and  the Lord will arise out of His hiding place and reign King  of Nations as He does now king of Saints, this would destroy all the Governments of the Earth. Do the Latter day Saints  wish the Nations of the Earth any Evil No we would save  them all if we could. But it was a mercy anciently to cut  off the wicked from the Earth that their posterity should not  inherit the Earth to follow the wickedness of their fathers  Gog &amp; Magog will ere long gather to fight against the Saints of the  Lamb of God and when hope is almost fled Christ will come and End the scenery. If a prophet has been schooled in the  society of the Gods to come to the Earth as a prophet to do a  work for the kingdom he has the power of God with him to help him do it the same as we ordain a man to build  up a county whare we cannot go so when a prophet  comes he comes holding the keys of the kingdom of  God &amp; binds &amp; seals on Earth that which is bound &amp; sealed  in Heaven    I should not have taken the pains I have to preach it to the world and act the part I have in it but I know that God has sent a  Prophet to us and ordained a Priesthood &amp; set up his kingdom  on Earth and a religion that is not evry thing is nothing Jesus broke bread &amp; said Eat in rememberance of me and  this do untill I come and always remember me when Joseph was  murdered the piety of the people did not oppose his murder  when they arise will it be with white robes No but with garments  spotted with blood of the prophets. None on the Earth had sympa thy but the Saints. I have been spending a time to build up a   ENDENTRY  to these vallies of the mountains is it not that we may be  sheltered when the Judgments of God come on Babylon  A man should not be so taken up with his farm as to Forget this work some will say I have done so much for this Church that I must now do sumthing for myself there is  now many in Jackson Co who are waiting for the Saints to  come there but they will not get the blessings those will  who have come to the Salt Lake valley this is the best way to Heaven. Some want to go to I want men to go with me who want to go to meeting and  get reproof &amp; kiss the rod I had such men with me &amp; we  done well. I bear testimony that God is with this people    interested &amp; edifyed in the testimony which had been bourn  by the presidency &amp; Twelve &amp; those who had spoken President  Joseph Smith was a prophet  of God He was well qualifyed to bear testimony of him He  has been with him day &amp; night in his public &amp; private  councils he knows his life and he has followed close in  his footsteps He always loved him and had he have been in Nauvoo at the time of his arest he would have stove  the barn doors into kindling wood  could not have liberated him any other way. their  is sumthing interesting in the testimony of men the anci- ents were martered for the testimony which they held  which they bore of Jesus Christ so men in this day  are opposed for their testimony but I know Joseph Smith was a prophet of God so is Brigham Young the  mantle of Joseph rest upon him and he has power to lead this people and my soul is filled with Joy  when he stands here &amp; speaks the word of the Lord &amp;  brings forth the glorious things of the Kingdom of God    rule the people mourn. Ask the world do the wicked rule  yes And they mourn do they seek a righteous man  rule No if the curse has followed the rule of the wicked it  will follow but let them sleep on &amp; take your rest but  we understand the Lord has rent the veil sent Angels to us and the gospel to preach to the poor the difference  between us &amp; the world is they say but do not nor  believe not we say &amp; both believe &amp; do the world spend  thousands of Dollars to preach the gospel but do not  believe it when the Judgments of God rest upon the  wicked &amp; they are cut off then will be the  of Grapes after the vintage is done. let the righteous  reign &amp; the righteous will rejoice in the House of Israel God  takes up the Isles as a little thing builds up &amp; pulls down at  his pleasure and why are not the people willing He should  reign Because of their meanness some may ask do not good man reign. I will ask a question should an Angel  come to President Fillmore &amp; tell him how to govern   ENDENTRY  up in a mad house and if God was to reveal to him  truth concerning the people &amp; he was to tell of it the people would kill him this is the situation of this government the best on Earth. But let the president  sware &amp; take the name of God in vaine &amp; curse God all its form and they would let him stay with them as Hail fellows well met and the Nations will be damned &amp; go to Hell who killed Ill in connexion with  the Carthage Mob and the whole Government  it &amp; they will be damned from the President to the least member I think no more of a King or President than of the   this Nation is the first the gospel was sent unto she has  killed the prophets that God sent unto them &amp; their doom  will be the Neithermost Hell    I will add a few words when Hiram Smith fell in Carthage Jail and exclaimed I am a dead man then Joseph Smith fell dead John Taylor fell wounded I carried him to another part of the Jail covered him up I walked out before the people &amp; said that Joseph &amp; Hiram Smith who lay before me slain were two of the best men that ever lived Joseph Smith was a prophet of God &amp; Hiram a Patriarch two better men never lived two better men God never made. Joseph was a Prophet Brigham is as great a Prophet and he that believeth it may be saved &amp; he that believeth it not will be damned.    ENDENTRY September 8, 1851    addressing the people it was granted him he arose and commenced his speach by testifying ^of^ his kind reception among this people He had been sick among them &amp; been kindly treated the fl had been brushed from his face by a Lady &amp; he was thankful He  refered to the Judiciary requested the people to sustain it &amp; professed to be vary sorry that he was going to leave it. He then refered to a report in circulation that he  came here for the Purpose of being returned a delegate to washington &amp; other things that were reported against  him &amp;c. He then took up the subject of his appointment and said that President Fillmore had appointed him  although he was a Democratt &amp; said he should not have received his appointment had he not been a  uous subject of the Washington Monument wished them to procure a block of Marble &amp; to present it to washington also wished them to donate for the building of the Monument talked much about the virtues of washington &amp; his bat tles &amp; good deeds.

He said several stood by &amp; wished to take up the challenge given by the Judge but he would not permit of it for some might get their hair pulled if not their throats cut. And he would not have it He wished the meeting to adjourn &amp; meet in the afternoon &amp; transact business in the capacity of a conference for which the meeting was called Meeting adjourned one hour    Kempton addressed the meeting was followed By Broth Gifford. Br John Young next addressed the House &amp; was followed by  H. C. Kimball who said I will tell one thing that will  have a great effect upon us will remove the mist when we  come to the House of the Lord Bring an offering to the Lord I wil make an Offering to the Lord &amp; to the priesthood as Abram did to Melchezedic &amp; offer the best you have. did this law come from Joseph who was ordained under the hands of Peter Brigham Young was ordained under the hands of Joseph to hold the keys of the Kingdom of God if you strike against him you strike against God who sent him The Judges came here to Judge criminals not to Judge us who keep the Law. He then sat down &amp; we had a song from the welsh Brethren    you may think it is a Novel conference How long has it been since we have had the privilege of spending a conference und Kempton speak or any good man. I will preach Br Abbott funeral sermon and the funeral sermon of all the faithful His body is laid in the dust to rest untill the resurrection forever blessed is the man that lives &amp; dies a Saint. I will tell whether the Messenger sent to Brother Kempton was of God or the Devil If the Messenger sent was of God he would know it, if the messenger was any whare els but here he must have come from Heaven or from   ENDENTRY  you will find some people as honest &amp; good as Angels as far as they know but do they have revelations from God &amp; know the things of God No they do not. If Brother Kempton has had his sins  forgiven &amp; remitted without baptism so could all men but this is false for no man could have forgiveness without the sheding of blood &amp; baptism the Bible says unless you keep the commandments you cannot be saved when Br Kempton sayes he knows his sins were forgiven before he was baptized  he dont know what he sayes At times the spirit of God is given to men to see the kingdom of God and they think they are  in it when they have not entered the door of baptism dont go &amp; call the different Denominations because their sins are not forgiven them that they are always going to dwell in Hell for if they a many who carry the Gospel to men their is as good people among all sects Gentiles Jews &amp; Heathen as their is on Earth they act according to the best light they have. what is the condem- nation of this Government, light has come into the world &amp; men love darkness rather the light they reject that light fight the prop hets &amp; shed their blood for this they are damned    Brigham &amp; all men what they were by the assistance of light &amp; truth as far as we follow light &amp; truth so far we shall appoxamate  towards light &amp; truth &amp; God if God &amp; Angels were made what they are by truth as far as we learn that truth &amp; follows out  the council of it so far he will be like God &amp; when he leaves that truth he goes into darkness &amp; misery. If the United States were practi- zing truth they would be vary different from what they now are the practice of right things make men rejoice the practice of Evil things make sorrow we are agents to do right or wrong if a man feels disposed to go to Hell he has a right to it is no mans business He goes on his own responsibility and agency so if he wishes to Go to Heaven he has a right to by keeping a Celestial law let me do my work to acceptance. we know many truths we cannot think off of.

Bishops a thing that we never have done. when I approach the subject of the Bishops I pause not with a trembling hand but I want to take time &amp; look at it all day until we can see  clearer than we now do. this people still stick to the world  love the world, we should use the world &amp; not worship it No man is free indeed untill he is free in Christ and above the world dont worship the world you will not be free Is their any one that has anything but what God gave him you cannot make one hair white or black. Now it is our duty to feed cloth &amp; sustain the families of those who are in the vineyard preaching if we let them suffer &amp; they die their blood will be required at our hands we as a people have never   ENDENTRY  dont do their duty.

The Patriarch John Smith said I rejoice to have the privilege of speaking to you I have been in the work since  Jan 1832, and am about the oldest man here I was ordained  an Elder under the Hands of Joseph Wakefield. The Smith family was chosen to bring forth this work My team halled the first load of stone to build the kirtland temple my Son George A Drove the team. There was 4 Brothers us in the stand in Kirtland I am now left alone. I was in Jail with Hiram the night before they were killed, next day 3 guns were snaped at me I could not weep for a long time when I did weep I wept much. I have laboured much from  that untill this to keep things right. It is the little Foxes that spoil the vines we have a Prophet for a leader now pay your tithing &amp; make good measure when you sell any thing, &amp; fulfill all your covenants if made right we shall then prosper in this valley I am an old man &amp; cannot say much but I will write a peace to be published in the paper    Young Abram paid tithes to Melchezedeck. A certain woman gave a purse others filled it Br Rhodes gave the President sixty four pounds of gold for the public works He has not lacked anything you should give the best you have to the Lord &amp; He will pour you out a blessing that there will not be room to receive it    was thankful for the confidence put in him. I want to bear my testimony of the things of God He spoke of his experience wanted to know his duty &amp; was ready to do it.       come out right He spoke well upon tithing    Brethren speak &amp; bear their testimony of the Prophet Joseph we have had many revelations let us improve upon them    vote to quit using tea &amp; coffee, the Brethren have voted not to use tobaco I will speak of the Bishops I spoke of them  yesterday, &amp; reproved them sharply some wanted  an apology to them I will not I will see them in Hell before I will do  it. If this people do not do better than the Bishops have they will and if you do not do better than you have done you will go to Hell I will begin with myself. I have taught the Bishops principle &amp;  their duty Ask them if they can do it No I will cut the Bishops  off from the Church if they do not do better. did I ever council them wrong you have trampled my council under foot I shall not shrink from duty.

If you want your pay apply  here, &amp; you can get it. You did not enlist to get $8 pr month  they enlisted us to kill us and because we speak our sentimets  we are accused of treason I dont ask any odds of the U.S. I will  express my feelings to drive us from our Millions &amp; possessions  than require us to fight their battles is not right.    &amp; the Bishops and all will pay their tithing. This is the kingdom  of God &amp; if it falls I am willing to fall with it. I had rather  fall than stand if the Priesthood falls. All covenanted  to pay their tithing one tenth of all they possess    &amp; wished all the Bishops to do the same       tithing to the Bishops of their ward. He refered to the remarks  made by Father Smith on the word of wisdom. He said $50000  dollars had been spent in the valley during the past year for needless  things for Coffee tea Tobaco &amp;c many others remaks were mad By president Youg "Elder Banks spoke upon the law of liberty President Youg followed in reply &amp; said the liberty of the Holy Gospel  was peace &amp; righteousness we had no liberty to take away another  mans rights but the first principle of liberty was resignation &amp;  submission for go whare you will to Heaven or Hell you have to submit  to laws we are at liberty to adobt evry Holy principle to all Eternity go East North or South keep evry thing you want for  yourself wife children houses cattle &amp; create out of the elements  evry thing you can yet you are not at liberty to infringe  upon the rights of men you may have the privilege to do all  things that is done in heaven.

I could not tell whare  I was I was in danger of being lost without a guide I trust that while I have been absent on a mission to Great Britain I  have also been assisting to build up the kingdom of God &amp;  when I left I believed it would continue to roll forth the work had taken such a deep root the powers of darkness could not break it up it seemed at times as though we should take the kingdom. The organization of the Churches  by the Twelve in that country was so perfect that notwithstanding  the great spread &amp; increase of the work we can know monthly the state of the Churches increase &amp;c throughout the  whole realm. The faith of the Saints in that land was increasing a great spirit of enquiry was manifesting itself in the High ranks of Society esspecially when they  hear of the rapid progress of the work &amp; prosperity of this  people we are not hid up as some suppose. It is the general  Idea that we are destined to become a great people &amp; a  Mighty Nation (is this treason) we are a strong people &amp;  destined to be stronger untill our News reaches the utmost  parts of the Earth so that when the Mail comes the question  will be asked what News do you hear from that mighty  people in the Mountains as the emigration increases &amp; ship  arive It will all increase the work &amp; it will be as impossible to  hide it from the world as it would for the shining of the sun  to be hid &amp; Zion will be terrible to the Nations of the Earth I feel as great a desire to help bear up the kingdom as a  man can I am willing to spend my life &amp; all I have  to build up this kingdom I am willing to stay here or go  back tomorrow I presume this is the feelings of the Elders  here in this body their is Nothing so Joyful as to build up  the kingdom I would rather be abroad binding up the  grain than to break up my Farm if I had all the welth  of the Earth I would rather go without purse or scrip than to spend  the time to work for myself when I look at the magnitude of  this work I cannot feel otherwise with the spirit of God in my  heart I want to see the Seventies going forth &amp; gathering from  all kingdoms &amp; countries &amp; from every Island of the Sea untill  all Israel is gatherd. I do not feel to say more to day but will sit down &amp; hear from my Brethren, I wish to do my duty while here    &amp; others this is my Fathers House we have had good instruct ion from our Brother here I have spent my time to settel  other Colonies we cannot all settel down here we should  spend our lives to improve &amp; prepare ourselves for immortal glory   ENDENTRY  to the south before they settel here &amp; help to build up a stake  if you remember the words of God in the days of Joseph  says Ye are laying the foundation of a great work and ye  know it not. we are now preparing to have a state  soon, soon the Brethren will come by  We have at Parowan 80 men &amp; boys we want to have  evry man who knows any thing about making Iron  go to Iron Co. &amp; make Iron as long as we have to buy  evry thing &amp; pay 3 prices for it we shall be poor I  would rather mak our own ware &amp; ploughes than to be a slave  to Ill. I never dreamed that when I or any Elder had a mission to preach the Gospel or build up Zion to ask  to be dismissed or return home untill my work was  closed such an Idea Never enterd my brain. If the  Saints will scatter abroad &amp; settle these far vallies we can  come up here &amp; present our tithings &amp; offering &amp; come &amp; wor ship as they did in Jerrusalem come &amp; raise  of wheat &amp; potatoes &amp; say to the Nations of the Earth come  &amp; eat &amp; do sumthing to build up Zion.     &amp; return thanks for the blessings received we can respond to it  the work is of all importance to the Human family the  Brethren are all willing to do right &amp; they say Lord not  my will but thine be done. If the Lord should say come  &amp; preach to us we would say Amen to it the Lord has his  means to carry on his work and also his own means to do it  when the peoples hearts are prepared to do the will of  God the victory is ours if we come to understanding so  as to have the organization of the kingdom of God so that  evryone acts in unison like a beautiful peace of machinery  when we gain the victory we shall then know how to order our  speech &amp; conversation aright before God this is a good  people cannot we be better we have faith &amp; knowledge cannot we have more of it yes their is an Eternity of it. we  have learned to obey by the things we suffer but what do we  behold their is evil surmising, speaking, &amp; doing. the Evil intruder has not left us. who is keeping this commandment that loves  his Neighbor as he does himself will save his Neighbor  Garden &amp; crops &amp;c we shall then believe &amp; practice all the commands we shall have one common interest I  dont care what you believe if you practice right &amp; act  as though you love the Lord &amp; then you will do right their  is no school like your own experience when I herd Geore  A. Smith speak I thought of former days when men  from Canida &amp; other places would stop 50 miles this side of  Kirtland leave the money with the wife go &amp; see Joseph  &amp; say how I love you. But let Joseph ask him for a few dollars &amp; they would instantly dodge at it while in  the world you would go away now you are here I canot  get you to go to the far vallies because warfare &amp;  are not there I felt like crying abot Amasa company they  were ready to go to Hell. How ready the people are to go to Hell  let the Eyes of the saints be open I had to plead with   ENDENTRY  them Now I want you to go &amp; you wont go I want to have  you go to Iron Co. the people here are so full of wheat &amp; good  things that they loath it. If you dont want to pay your  tithing the Lord dont want you tithing untill you go into Hell  if you dont want to save yourself nor your children  nor your dead dont pay your tithing if you do want to save  then pay your tithing for it is for your benefit not  mine you cannot do the Lord any good in it or add to  his glory but it is for yourself. The cattle have come  in well of late and I think the best has been sent in you should be industrious &amp; saving, I dont want my children  to be lazy if I die I dont want any man to foster them in  idleness make your cloth yourself I wish my boys  had to work as I did for a living.    ENDENTRY October 6, 1851    adjournment singing &amp; Prayer by W W Phelps  President Young said the time had come to commence  the business of the semianual conference the business  of the last conference was productive of more good  than any conference we ever held. the keeping  of the word of wisdom has done much good I will be exceding glad when we arive at wisdom in all things  the word of wisdom was given in Kirtland 20 years  ago for the benefit of all Saints when we live 20 or 50 years longer we shall see that we do not  understand much of the word of wisdom we are  but babes in understanding wisdom who understands  it, was all spoken that might be spoken their is but one  elation of Jesus Christ in the heart of man when he  possesses the Holy Ghost we are forbidden to use meat in hot  weather. Hot drinks &amp; tobaco is not good for man you should not eat to over load your stomach. their is a greater  lack in my system of wisdom of tempering my food &amp;  exercise than in eating meat or tobaco. Tithing is com ing in so fast their will not be room to receive it  I wanted this conference to come together so I could  see their faces not to scold them I want to see their  faces they look better to me than all the Glories of  the Earth I said when the Brethren got out of  prision I wanted to sit &amp; look at them three weeks Our  graineries &amp; stour house are full of wheat &amp; good things  If this people are rich beautiful &amp; happy I am with them. If they are miserable I am still with them if this  people  be FIGURE it is in vain for one man to build himself up &amp;  neglect his brothers interest He will fail in it. we  must begin to manifacture all we want or we are slaves  to every thing in all the Earth evry thing is against  Mormonism &amp; Mormonism is against evry thing everything  is against us Hear it O Earth for the kingdom of God is  against all Earth &amp; Hell this is true &amp; we shall fight   ENDENTRY  of our God we shall fight battle after battle untill the victory is won we have to fight &amp; lay down our  lives for Christ sake we now want to gather companies  to go to the different vallies. I want the potters to remain  here &amp; work at their business. Jesus descended below all things before He ascended above all things we have got to sacrafice ever freely in order to be exhalted  before God. I once said I will go &amp; build me a house on the hill out of the mud. Joseph said you will stay  whare you are this was enough I dodged as quick as I  could I said enough since I have been willing to be  Governed by circumstances that have surrounded me  &amp; leave the event in the Hands of God    I expected to sit &amp; hear &amp; learn I have been a silent  observer of your temporal &amp; spiritual matters. Your  Governor has laid a foundation for you to build upon  I consider it to be the province of this people to determine  for themselves what they most need I do not see that you will break any law of God in doing right &amp; your  own will I like the remarks made that you be free  &amp; not abject slaves make what you want &amp; be free  buy all you want &amp; be slaves. we say we look to  &amp; do his will. We are a little people upon a little patch  of the Earth but if we all pull together we shall become the Head. I did not run with the rest because I thought  it right to stay. If I thought it right to run I should  run, but it was right to stay so you must be right  the Lord said you must gain your bread by the sweat of the brow you must make your own leather or you  cannot get money enogh to buy it with so with  tea coffee &amp; sugar you must raise &amp; make it or go  without it you must make your own Iron or fail for Iron must be had. leathier &amp; Iron must be maid &amp; make your own clothing. I like your conferences &amp; to hear the best men speak to communicate intel- ligence to others the church all draws one way &amp; this  puzzles the world they all draw one way &amp; have a  reason for it this I glory in I would not obey  if their was not a reason for it I would leave  Z Snow would not draw with you if he could not give a reason for it. I came here to deal out Justice  to all Jew &amp; Gentile alike I came not to watch for iniquity but to punish iniquity when it does appear  I have had 200 cases in a year with the same No as you are I hope you will not have a case you will  never be destroyed unless you destroy yoursel if you do not war with yourselves I hope others will not war with you     &amp; Banks to be travelling Bishops to visit other Bishops to call them to an account &amp; see that they are   ENDENTRY  duty untill the spirit of God rest upon you &amp; you hold  the keys of the Melechezedek priesthood of the Eternal God  &amp; the power of it rest upon you forever Brother Felt were Ordained under the hands  of the Presidency.     says A Cordon is nominated to be a travelling Bishop carried  unanimously He was ordained under the hands of HCK John &amp; G A Smith Heber C Kimball sealed upon his head all the keys of the priesthood said the power  of God should rest upon his head to preside over other Bishops. Another thing is necessary which will effect the whole world that is a reffermation chose  men who are filled with the Holy Ghost to go forth as  missionaries to stir up the feelings of the Saints in  all these vallies of the Mountains I thank God  that we are free D Fulmer &amp;  Z Pulsipher was appointed as missionaries    home here I want to speak concerning Iron Co I  had but 20 or 30 with me there President Young wants John D Lee to get a company to go over the rim  of the Basin &amp; form a settlement in a good place   for wine fruit &amp; corn I asked some of Amasas  company what they were going to do they said they  were going to plant a vineyard if they had done  it there they would have done good you should go to Iron Co settle your families then go down  in the winter &amp; build a fort the Indians there  are well supplyed with arrows on foot No arrows  or guns it is poorer than Iron Co it borders upon  the Great sahara desert I felt that we are free when I heard that Iron &amp; coal was found in  abundance within 15 miles of each other in Iron Co. we  have not the Great Blast Furnises that are in the  world but must begin with the Native Element. He  also made other remarks    wished parents to pay particular attention to teaching their children  after which the conference closed it was one of the most  interesting conferences ever held by this people.    ENDENTRY October 9, 1851    said he did not believe any man capable or qualifyed to  speak acceptable to God no matter what his abilities were unless he had the spirit of the Holy Ghost He would  not take any office on Earth if the office of the president  of the United States was offered him he would disdain it as far as the honor of it was concerned He would rather have the office of a teacher in this church as it would last   ENDENTRY  last but 4 or 8 years I should be glad to live to see the  day when their should not be a Kingdom or government  on Earth ownly that ordained of God to govern the  world I do not know as I shall live to see it but I have much desired it for a man to desire to live merely to get honor to himself would not be right but for him to desire to live to honor God &amp; build up his kingdom would be a good desire. If I knew I could be translated to all  the glory of the  rather live &amp; suffer with my Brethren through all their troubles untill the coming of Christ I am sorry to see the old vetrans who have helped to lay the foundation of this church lay their bodies in the Grave I believe many will live those who have had it promised unto them if they remain faithful untill the coming of Christ &amp; help build up the kingdom this has been promised to me by the patriarch &amp; prophet while receiving my Endowment the hearts of men were inspired to give us these blessings while their hands were upon our heads. this always stim- ulates us to hold on by faith when death is around us &amp;  slayes thousands upon our right &amp; left hand it is an easy matter for God to strengthen a man in his Tabernacle in the midst of Death &amp; plagues all around him He did the Ancients who lived to a great Age their Eyes were not dim their Ears were quick to hear but we all have weaknesses &amp; much to contend with this is that we may increase &amp; arive at Great Glory by  getting the mastery over the devil &amp; much evil if we were  not tempted &amp; tryed &amp; overcome we should not get the glory that we otherwise shall. How could God trust a man  who would be overcome by temptation it would take him a long time to get confidence in him again Jesus was a fair sample subject as He was to temptation in all things He overcame so can we &amp; follow in the steps of our Elder  Brother Better to do this than to Enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season then die as the fool dieth if a man had power given him &amp; had not discretion given him to use it he would ruin himself this is the reason why this people 20 years old has not  we have the gifts of the Gospel to heal the sick to speak with New tongues, to cause the blind to see lame to walk deaf to hear, &amp; cast out devels &amp; with these gifts some  have been so lifted up taken honor &amp; glory unto themselves they have fallen. I thank God for sparing his gifts any further than they prove beneficial to us if God gave us all things at once it would kill us but if we were proven in all things then we could endure all things (things are freq- uently given of the Lord that men cannot all endure they are more than they have wisdom to manage when this is the case they cannot advance untill they master what has been given let this be remembered &amp; not ask for more after what we can manage for if we ask the Lord for a Revelati- on &amp; He gives us a New commandment we are under the greater respon- sibility for we have to keep all the commandments of God   ENDENTRY  light becomes darkness then how great is that darkness it would be better for him not to have the light at all If the Lord had given all men all they have asked for they would many of them been out of the Church now I have herd many say I have Asked the Lord to reveal certain principls unto me &amp; He did not do it but this is because it was not wisdom to give it unto you but if you are faithful the day will come when God will give any man what he asks for if he asks for it in righteousness. I believe the  Lord loves this people &amp; is preparing us to recieve all good  things the day will come when the Lamanites will build a city called the New Jerrusalem. They not we build it we with all the Gentiles who repent will help build it the powers of Heaven will be revealed &amp; Jesus be in our midst and the power of Heaven be revealed by Adam  &amp; all men will hear it in the kingdom of God and all secrets &amp; key words of the priesthood &amp; all things will be revealed I hope you will harken to council &amp; do all things which  God Requires of us in the name of Jesus Christ Amen    ENDENTRY October 12, 1851    good exhortation    of the prophet He knew the Twelve had to lead, had no desire to follow any body els. He was followed By Brother Major    ENDENTRY October 19, 1851    of Sister Hendricks. He was thankful we as a people were settelled in these vallies of the Mountains whare it was healthy we have here to fore suffered much by sickness in other places but we cannot get entirely away from sickness &amp; death let us go whare we will in this life for all men must taste of death even those who  were translated had to have a change to Immortality their may be some pain attending that even if it  was ownly for an instant. Their must be some space between death &amp; the resurrection sin is the cause of this evil even death without sin men would have been Immortal. If I should hear of a God who had made  man to have pain &amp; sorrow without any agency or sin I could not have any confidence in him, &amp; the Heavens could not it may be said it is necessary to have sorrow &amp; misery in order to Enjoy good the Lord when He made the world knew how to fix things so that man should bring upon himself death evil &amp; sorrow if he had agency He planted  the tree of knowledge of good Evil in the midst of the garden little children did not commit sin but their parents did it was not our own sins that brought death but the sin of our first parents death being introduced into the world we all partake of it if we had not the great plan of salvation revealed we should be without law if it was not for revelation we should not know that we had an Immortal spirit within us we should take   ENDENTRY  care of as well as the body the spirit is a being that  possesses certain capacities that are as Eternal as  God himself that were never given to it I do not believe  that any matter that ever saw the time that it could not love hate fear &amp;c can ever do it again but I believe it is Eternal the formation may not be Eternal but the substance of which it is composed is Eternal the capacities may be enlarged but its capacity always exhisted their may be a time when our spirits had a begining of formation but the capacity always exhisted the Infant at first appeared as a blank page but  that spirit before it came here was full of knowledge as was the case with the Babe of Bethlehem Jesus Christ He had wisdom  to construct worlds before He came here but had now descended below all things came from His Fathers throne but his knowledge power &amp; wisdom was laid aside &amp; nothing but the bare capacity was left can any man remember the first  life in the flesh No Neither can you remember the time of your exhistance or doings before you came here this is to prove men if they will prove faithful while this know ledge is taken from them in infancy childhood &amp; manhood  life &amp; Death if one man Jesus Christ can ascend &amp;  overcome all things so can another. If we find anything that is good lovely, virtueous, good, exhalted then let  us lay hold of it untill we are exhaulted then the spirit  will adorn the body &amp; do away with many of the Evils of the fall their is sumthing in the countenance of a man who takes care of his spirit that is glorious &amp; good the Lord made the spirit of man according to the plan devised in his wisdom but this was made of  Eternal substance of many beings composed in  in ourselves brought together into one &amp; Gems given to our spirits then let us take care of our spirits. many thing may be said about the object of our bodies &amp; spirits they are destined to arise in glory Exhaltation And Eternal  life then let us take care of our bodies &amp; spirits we have our minds filled with the cares of life &amp; yet when  we die we have to leave all our temporal affairs it  seems to be the object of God that we should earn  our bread by the sweat of the brow if this was not the case we might be Idle which would produce more evil than it would to labour if we improve our time we shall get glory that we should not get if we were Idle for when we die the knowledge we have gained will be of benefit to us we cannot get a fulness of Glory while our spirit &amp; body is seperated we may think reflect &amp; know right from wrong but we cannot act as in the body we  shall look for the resurrection of the body with much interest &amp; great anxiety if it was not for the resurrection of the body we should be subject to the devil &amp; death temporal &amp; spiritual those who kept the celestial law will be redeemed from all sin &amp; death restored to God and all blessings their is for man such will have Joy in paradice. Joseph says if we keep the law we shall   ENDENTRY  &amp; hunt up our bodies &amp; enter it again with a fulness of celestial spirit. How will the Resurrection be brought to pass &amp; when will be the different times of the resurrection the good ^{and bad}^ will arise before those who die after the Resurrection of Christ the good did arise at the Resurrection of Christ we find mummies in the catacombs of Egypt who died long before christ arose who remain yet some saints in Asia &amp; America did arise &amp; appear unto many. I do not  believe the resurrection will take place by being born again as the doctrin of some is I would not believe it for the world unless President Young was to say the Lord had revealed  it to him I believe the Saints will arise out of their  graves ##Ezekiel 34:12## as Ezekiel said they would. The Resurrection will take place before the son of Man comes as the scriptures declair. Before He comes their shall be a great sign appear in Heaven all the Nations of the Earth shall see it together An Angel shall sound his trump that all Nations will  hear it saying that Babylon will be burned then after half an hour of silence the veil of the covering will be taken off the face of Heaven will be revealed &amp; the  face of the Lord will be unveiled and the graves of the Saints will be open &amp; the Saints on the Earth will be caught  up to meet the Lord this is the first Resurrection the Zion of Enoch will also appear &amp; dwell on the Earth the Saints will then receive their Everlasting inher itances Joseph got a promise from the Lord that he should have a right to an inheritance in the Nauvoo  House forever. if the Saints do not get their possessions  by covenant as Joseph Nauvoo their will be Judges appointed to give evry  man his inheritances for an Everlasting inheritance then comes the time when Joseph and all will receive their keys &amp; turn them to the saints in this dispensation &amp; reveal the mysteries of Eternity to the Saints who have their celestial bodies they will be qualifyed to receive a fulness of celestial glory &amp; spirit &amp; will receive all they can Endure but they will grow to all Eternity in knowledge &amp; power will the Saints be confined to this Earth No they will be caught up  &amp; not die &amp; lie in the dust Jesus will have a Throne in Jerrusalem &amp; the Saints will have thrones on the Earth but they will go to other worlds or in the Heavens &amp; all will be free Adam will give instructions concerning the garden of Eden we will go on foreign missions to visit other worlds we shall also remember our works in this life &amp; inasmuch as they have been good it will be a consolation to reflect upon them    them 9 in all.      ENDENTRY  the board of Health at Great Salt Lake City Dec 1851    gence to the people my first proposition is the science of medicine. The study &amp; practice of medicine as a science if it  may be called a science is the most imperfect of any science  in existance as is practiced by the doctors of the present day The doctors &amp; priests of the day send more to death &amp; Hell then any whare els. about one in a million may get some glory A bigger set of cursed scoundrels never graced the Earth than that class. surgery is a different class &amp; is vary necessary in  many instances &amp; that system can be learned. But to learn the  system of man they cannot no more learn that than they  can learn the Heavens. A worst set of Ignoramuses do not walk the Earth. they do not know how to turn {the  body when it gets cross ways. If you cut their infernal throats  the people will live I know what this society is here for it is to impart what knowledge they have to others. But I have seen the folly of the  doctors even at my own doors. take them as a whole they are  the most damnable set on the Earth their practices are infamous  &amp; their medicines produce death; If the people want to Eat Calomel let them do it &amp; be damned but dont feed it to any of my family if any doctor does &amp; I know it I would kill him as quick as I would for feeding Arsnic. I do not  employ such doctors to visit me. I dont Employ any doctor to visit me. The practice of Doctors in visiting women in child birth is damnable woman should be let alone &amp; let Nature have its part at work let a woman keep her child if she can 2 or 3 years but she cannot do it when the time has come Nat- ure will deliver her of her child without a Doctor dont fret let evry thing take its proper course &amp; sickness would  depart away. The Doctors in New Haven Ct by mutual  agreement to see how far they could frighten a man did actually frighten him to death a robust harty man. many  things should be said to this people. their has not been a Doctor baptized into this church that has the Holy Ghost but what will acknowledge they are a fool. their is not a Physician in the church or in the world that is taught from on high by revelation but what will acknowledge  this to be true doctrin if their is a doctor who can see &amp;  know a man from head to foot &amp; know how to cure his  deseases by revelation such are the ownly true &amp; safe  Doctors on Earth all others are fools I see men die in the hands of the doctors. the medicines kill them. why  dont they tell what ales the patient or acknowledges  they dont know.    is disgraceful &amp; makes me mad &amp; the day will come when you will not wonder at my feelings you are natural persons &amp; God has made you natural if you are with child that child will come forth by nature without a Dr the Earth is just so will bring forth of itself seed after its kind. If a person is sick &amp; have not faith to be healed give them herbs the product  of the Earth &amp; it will cure you until it is time to die   ENDENTRY  doctor &amp; she gets well Nature promps her to it if a dog is bit with a rattlesnake he will dig a hole in the Earth  &amp; lie in the ground untill the poison is gone out so  Nature will teach us as well as the cat &amp; dog when a toad  is bit by a spider it will go &amp; eat plantain if he can get it. If a child is to die in being born let it die but dont  employ a Dr to kill it. How will you be instructed I will  tell you what to do if you are taken sick dont be frightened  but be calme. if you get a cold let Nature be jo disease will go up &amp; down through the system to find a place to be located it is as much our duty to know how to  cure our system as to feed our body the Doctors would  say you are deseased &amp; dont know it who made the Doctors the  Devil. The Lord did not make the Doctors of the present day such a thing as a man midwife was not known untill  about  look at the Indians for 100 years millions of children have been born in the wilderness of male &amp; female &amp; they live &amp; not die without a doctor. You may ask what shall we do I will tell you I will give you a lessen &amp; I want you to remark  it when you go to visit a woman in travail let her alone  untill her full time has come remember it let the mother alone let your system be natural teach them also to exercise all that they can that when they come to be deliverd it will be better for them. A doctor if he had good sens would not wish to visit women in child birth, and if a woman had good sense she would not wish a man to doctor them  on such an occasion I want you to teach your children  the principle of truth I talk as I do for the people will not sens any thing unless they are half knocked down or  thunder rolls in their Eaers soft words will not do I  want you to hear &amp; understad their has been some difficulty in this Board of Health. If I had been with you you would not  had had any difficulty. It has been through a misunderstanding if you understand principle you would not quarrel you may spread calomel on your bread &amp; butter &amp; eat it if  you wish but it is deadly poison as Arsenic but not as quick it is not good you may ask if it was ever good in any case there may be cases whare it might be a  benefit but it would want a revelation to tell whare  it was. Their is not poison in lobelia I will give $5000 dollars for the 16 part of an oz of poison that  can be extracted out of all the lobelia in this valley. it is not probable that any two persons are organized just alike in all respects. Then who is a Physician Now unless he be taught of God &amp; is a prophet or revelator he cannot  understand the Human System know desease &amp; what will cure it I dont care how a man acts if he intends to act right &amp; when they act wrong are willing to be righted. we will take the Best physician of the day that lives the closest to the Lord I dont care how will he is he will be brought down as a fool for he will be made to let God be honored.  I have been on a Journey in  the dust I have got dust on my brain that is what ales me   ENDENTRY  can a doctor tell what ales a sick man by feeling of  his pulse No more than he could by feeling of a dogs  tail. Their is no Physician except he is taught of God you should learn how to doctor yourselves you should study your own system, any people who must trust to a doctor at all times will die but trust in God &amp; you will live longer what a diferent time it would be if all trusted in God  rather than in the doctors for 9 out of 10 die under the doctors care who would live if they trusted in God alone dont get freightened &amp; you will do well enough it is Just as reasonable to send for a doctor to have a calf, colt or pig brought forth as it was for a child.    forth spirits to all Eternity who will go to some world &amp; take  a tabernacle or body the same as we have you dont want a  doctor any more here than there if the members of this  society are true either male or female they will inpart all  useful knowledge they have to others if they are not willing to do this they are corrupt if one man knows more than another  let him tell his knowledge &amp; if a man knows more than all the rest let him be a Father unto the people &amp; teach them &amp; not act like a boy, if I hold myself Equal I am  Equal if I am soperior let me manifest it by doing a  better deed &amp; being superior myself. It is the man that rejects  light &amp; knowledge when shown him that God condemns &amp; I  condemn him some say we have spiritual wives but I think God has made us all natural &amp; I think we should be  Natural.    concerning law our Legislative Enactments &amp; various other  subjects.
