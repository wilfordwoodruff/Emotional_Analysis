 Sacramento City Aug. 28th, 52  Brother Wilford  I wrote you a few days since  in which I stated that those Bonds paid me by  Col. Reese were worth only 7c cts. in the dollar and he  gave me them at 8c cts. in the dollar. He wished me  to keep them as long as I could which I have done  as he supposed they would advance, and should they  bring even 8c cts. per dollar I was to pay him back the  amount and if they sold for any less than that he  would make it up. They are now worth only 65 cts.  and ^still at that^ I shall be obliged to sell them immediately as I  take the steamer for N. Yuk on the 1st Sept. the amount  he paid me in then was $1100 - the discount in that  amount between 8 c ch. and 65 would be 165$ which I  presume will be what I shall get for them  That amount $165 Mr. Reese must pay you so that  it can be forwarded this fall.  should that amount not  be right either way we will correct it.  The mail for  Salt Lake some days so that I cannot be more definite on the subject.  I shall hold them as directed by  Col. Reese till the last moment which will be the  31st, inst I am sorry and feel quite disappointed that  that matter is not closed up and hope it will be  attended to immediately, that there will be no more  delay on the part of Mr. Reese at the valley.  Nothing new of interest with me.  please write me  by next mail to the [Suters] saying how emegration is  coming in.  The long letter of this mail to this place I did not receive from you. Remember me very kindly  to Mrs. Woodruff and the family  Sister Webster and all enquiring  friends and believe me, in haste  Very truly Yours I. F. Carter

 July 5th, 1852  133 miles out from S. Lake  My Dear Sister & Bro  Having an opportunity of sending by Mr. Brown I write a few lines to say that I am quite well and progressing finely  I am pleased that the ordinance of baptism  was administered to me and am sorry that i am not authorized to do the same to any one that  might wish it. I think your friend M. Pince and perhaps John will soon think favorable enough of the [pm] to adopt it should an opportunity offer and I wish to it all my fellow men what good I am in this cold uncharitable world.  I had a very narrow escape this morning from a serious accident for which I feel very thankful to our Heavenly Father and the kind friends for their prayers for me protection from him  Fearing the Indians might trouble as we were examining our rifles, guns and pistols, one large rifle band hose pistel requiring reloading I undertook to discharge it at a mark, it burst in many pieces in my hands, but injured me but a trible, all expressed their great surprised at the result.

 wondering how it was possible for only me to escape with so little injury as I did.  Please write me a long letter to Sacramento City by next mail. Ms W. kindly promised to write to Ms Carter by next mail, she will prize it much coming from her and Mr. W.  Should you find a ring in the room I occu pied at your house please preserve it. the huse "From K" you had of Bro Kimball does not perfrm very well  please remember me to Bro K. when you meet him my respect- Ms Fss and family Ms Webster Fathr Woodruff  and all enguiring friends  Excuse this bad writing as my finger ir rather lame hoping God may help you and yours spiritually and temporally abundantly.  I remain  Very Much Yours J. F. Canter  P.S. when you write me at Sacramento City please write me a long plain letter for my own individual perusal.

 [upside-down text] Mail carrier has arrived home not yet saw the Col. [end of upside-down text]  Johnsons Ranch, six miles from [Plua] Aug 6th, 1852  My Dear Sister and Brother  Your favor of July 4th was handed me by the mail carrier and very welcome it was I can assure you, I should have been highly gratified to have spent the 4th with you. Col. Reese was not at home had gone to San Francisco. I am waiting here to see him on his return, expecting him daily. California presents a dull and dismal appearance, this is the dullest season of the year in consequence of the scarcity of water, many men are out of em ployment and cannot make one half enough to pay their board.  As soon as I see the Col, I shall go to Sacramento City and see what is to be done there, should I not be able to find some favorable business will take the steamer by and by for N. York Our journey from Salt Lake was rather hard, however we got along well, the last 400 miles are tough down the Humbolt and over the mountains. How very, very much I want to visit Salt Lake. I feel quite dissatisfied in leaving so soon. I feel much more interest in it now than formerly, it appears to me that I hardly saw you at all even after going so long a distance for almost exclusively that express business. Was it not for the great fatigue of the journey across the plains I would return that way but I possess hardly [usual] [cemaye] enough to undertake an other such trip.  I was glad to hear that Dr. B. had paid that dept. I was not uneasy about it as it had Brother [Tamgs] name on it that will be quite a help toward my settling my old affairs 
 [sideways text] I F Carter [end of sideways text]  and a settlement of them is something. God knows that I greatly desire. I am like a broken stick, of no account can do nothing no I desire. I feel it most deeply, and really hope that something may turn up whereby I may extricate myself I do not desire great wealth, that is not my object, society friends and relatives I prize much higher, with a privilege of living just as we shall wish we had when we came to die. This has been my wish and determination for years past to do as near what is right as possible, to do unto others just as I would have another do unto me, but we will do w[r]ong sometimes particularly when we are not under the influence of a higher power.  I feel very thankful that I spent the last night as I did in Salt Lake, the influence is very great on me, many views of the church coincide with my aim, that is, all with which I am fa miliar, some I know nothing of, which I shall leave with time to determine. We have had the advantages of a pious education, a pious Mother whose prayers have been long and frequent  and fervent for our future happiness and hope we shall fully appreciate them. I have been Providentially spared. I feel that I  have not deserved such loving kindness from the hands of a Supreme Being but the mind is tempered to the slian lamb and I am I hope truly thankful for his recollections of my wants and circumstances  On my way from this place to Sacramento I shall go by Salmon falls and try to find Calvin, hope he has been successful I should like much to meet with something by which I could make a few thousand, this winter will be as favorable a time as any I think to settle my old business should you be able to collect something in those accounts and forward let us much as possible be in American and foreign coin is the best I can do with valley coin is 20 pr. ct. discount and many refuse it at that there is a man in N. York formerly from Baltimore that is owing me an important amount, was unfortunate in business, should I chance to get that I should be all right, hope such a thing may phappen presume you see my letter from the plains by Brown. I shall expect a long letter from you by the next mail judging from present appearances I may not remain long in California, will write again soon, please remem ber me to all our friends and believe me  Very truly your friend I. F. Carter  P. S. If miss Whitaker did not get her insurance money it may not be convenient for her to pay that just at present please not ask her for it for she will pay as soon as she has it

I enjoy good health at the presant time I had my right thumb tore of in the saw mill 3 years ago, last Dec I cut of my right great toe cut of linthwise of my foot I have but one eye one thumb one great toe so you see there is A [sine] in the body I am still a believeer in the doctrin of the latter day saints as far as I have read their faith I think it is according to inspiation I should be exceding glad to be with you nothing but the means hinders my being with you my heart is with you and has been for A long time if I could get my body there as easy and quick as I can my heart I think you would see Uncle Ozem very soon I have not seen a mormon since you left conneticut I have been alone but not alone because the Father is with me I have some joy and peace in believing I feel strong in the Lord and in the power of his might and I believe we live in ^the^ last days and near the time when the remnant of Jacob as a lion among the flock of sheep who if he go throu both treadeth down and teareth  in pieces and none can hinder I was glad to hear from you and rejoice to here that brother Aphek is so well and contented I rejoice in your prosperity and your brethren I want to be with you but I must ^leave^ wife and children house but land I have none I live In hopes of being with you and shall if the Lord will if a way if prepared and made possible for me I received a letter from Azmon last winter informing me of the death of Aphek wife and his wife and also a flood of scripture to proove the im^m^ediate coming of christ that we live now down in feet and toes of the image and that the dashing time is at hand when the nations will be dashed to peices as a potters vessel I have heard nothing from Azmon since he wrote I have understood since he wrote he has given his landed to his children and reserved ten or twelve hundred dollars for his onewn use which is in cash 
 I am of opinion he has gone on ^A^ mishion should he call on me I will inform him of your Desire we have a preacher laitly come among us and he thus far teaches the morman faith holds to the gifts and grces of  church he Holds to the unconccousness of the Dead and and that they remain so till the resurrectoion and then they the wicked receive their part in that Lake that burns with fire & brimstone till they have paid the utmost  farthing and Left nether root or branch burnt up Destroid anilated he teaches that this earth will be the final home of saints when it is purified and be^c^ombs a new earth where in dwesls righteousness he teaches that the Jews will not be gathered till the end of the world that the tairs wood withe the  wheat untill the harvest the man is James Cowles Walter H Cowles son he says he does not belond to any sect of or denomination he says the  number of the beast is completed 666. the unconciousness of the Dead and  the final aniihalation of the wicked he has not taught pubylickly.  I want you to inform me into ^your^ faith and belief as far as the Lord will let you I want to know all about you and the mormons it is thot by some of my neighbours that the mormons will after a little be rooted up again that governor youngs does not conform to the general goverment that some of his doings is in opposition to the general goverent. We have it our news papers I am sorry to hear it true ofr fasls I hope in all favor the mormons may have a little rest [t]his side eternty you want to know how I get along I tend saw mill a part of the time James Lusk has built a new mill and has got a shingle mill and I have employment all the time when the mill can run we saw in addition to saw mill about four Hundred Thousand shingles a year I work By the day some part of the time I have 1 dollar a day some part of the time 75 Cts and bord myself my Family expenses sickness Doctors bill &c  takes  all I can earne my boys are unfortunate and sickness and misfortune keeps them Poor and I dont expect much help from them olthogh they are willing to help me all they can my children are all kind and willing to do all they can 
 Brother Azmon writes that god has set his hand to the work of gathering the scattered remnant of Israel and that we are living down under the sounding of the 7 Angel and that the Kingsdoms of this world are alreddy given to Jesus Christ and that he will soon break them with a rod of iron and dash them to peces as a potters vessel that the vision of 2300 days (years) is ended and that the sanctuary is now being clensed and the 3rd angel of ##Revelations 14:9-12|Rev 14: 9-12## is now delivering his message of warning to the Laodiceans and all who are in reach of salvation and warning them against worshiping the Beast and his image and Receiving his mark he says he fully believes he says the sabbath of the fourth com^m^and in the Seal of the Living god and the mark against which the 3rd angel of ##Revelations 14|14 Rev## warns us of reseiving under the no less penalty than of drinking the wine of the wrath of god is keeping the first day of the week [& on] sabbath he says the Parable of the ten Virgins is fulfuled and the wise Virgin have gone in to the marriage and the Door is shut  [##Matthew 25##] the Death is Lovely street since you was here are 25 or near as can remember I have buried my son Henry aged 18 years I have got to be great grand father a bright little daughter I am 64 years old enjoy good health I see the want of my right thumb but can tend saw mill verry well Bill Cowles sends his respects to Aphek and says he is but 73 or 74 years old he has his second wife he maried a woman that has had 5 husbands he makes the 6th enjoys himself well sister Hellen is well and family Cozen Abi Thompson has lost 2 sons 2 years past she has been maried the second time but he is dead his name Luke Case Titus and femely is well Cozen Thaddeas Thompson is well and family he has has lost his oldest daughter aged about 18 years at is a general time of health among us you must be tired of my scribling by this time and I must bid you A diue Remember me in your prayers that the blessing of heaven may rest on you and your family and all the Israel of god is the prayer of your weak Brother Ozem Woodruff

 San Francisco Jan 25 [18]53  Bro Woodruff  Dear Friend  Agreeable  to promise I write to inform you of my Safe arrival once more to California in company with my brethren of the missions and truly it is under quite different circumstances from those of [18]49 so far as my reception in this land is concerned I will Mer^e^ly Say my family were all glad to see me yet I went to their Portico in a boat as Sacramento was under water and had but a short time previous been laid almost entirly in ashes by fire and but few have escaped the dwellings of my family are spared but the whole buisness port is gone or nearly so I have come down to San Francisco to assist off the Elders and the Means are now Raised through Bro John M Horner and others and some from the world to the amount of nearly seven thousand dollars in all 
 and the Australia and Sandwich Missions are about ^to^ Embark and the rest will soon follow no doubt and will leave me to do the best I can I will here say I feel a spirit Resting upon me to labour to build up Zion according as my way shall open from time to time for surly there is no end to the labours of the servants of the last days and I think I feel that the Power of God Is resting down upon me for good it is true I do not know how my work will be done but somehow a whisper that all is well and may it be so is my continual prayer I know the Lord will do his own work the sufferings of the people through this country are very great Especialy in the mountains and valies where Snow & water has been abundant. Reports of Starvation and freezing to death are quite common yet I am not disapointed at all this but you will no doubt hear from the Reports of others and you will hear from Me from time to time but as yet I have not gathered all the news you may desire but hope so to do. Please remember me to all my good friends. I Should write to Prest Young but will wait a little 
 S Brannan is going to the states with his family I do not visit his house there are but few Saints in San Fransisco but there are more at San Jose but a short distance from here  one word I wish you would say to Bro Brigham that I do not forget him or his Instructions to me when I arrived at this plase. I was introdu- ced to Governor Bigler, who Introduced me to Capt Sutter I told the Gov that Governor Young governed the people in wisdom and disposed of all matters in mildness and I considered him a pattern he said he hoped that Gov Young would consider the Carson Valley as he considered ^it^ under his Jurisdiction and he had been called upon to settle difficulties that he hoped gov Young would Controul I told him I presumed that Gov young would be pleased to communicate with him he said he had thought of writing to him Gov Young the state of affairs in california are such that Government is a quere thing and Rulers are soon out of office if  they do not please the people and all opperate for gain and popularity 
 but as I have but little more Room I must close Bro Hiram Faulk is here and will no doubt Make Every exertion to push every thing that will promote the Intrests of the brethren and has already given of his means to help the Elders  [sideways text] Willford Woodruff Great Salt Lake  City Utah Teritory  A Badlam Jan 24th Answered may 24th 1853 [end of sideways text]  My head quarters I think will be at Sacramento where I should be pleased to Receive your letters with due Respect I Remain your brother and Friend - A Badlam

 Elder W.
