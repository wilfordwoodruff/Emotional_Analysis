A. Smith and two other Brethren came down to see us it was a happy meeting Red Creek was a good place  for a settlement    ENDENTRY May 10, 1851 ~ Saturday   10th We had another snow storm this morning the snow  fell 8 inches in the valley whare we were which was a great blessing to the people as it watered their wheat there had not been such a snow in the valley during the winter we took breakfast got up our teams and started for Cedar City we were met by G.

Smith and a horse company who came out to escort us in when we arived we were saluted by the fireing of cannon and the flag of the stars and stripes. we took up our abode among the Brethren in the fort Brother  Robinson we took a   ENDENTRY a walk to see G. A. Smith saw mill which was up so he could saw. He informed us they had an abundance of coal, magnacted Iron, Allum salt timber andc nearby we found the Brethren had done much since their arival they have about 100 men have been there 3 months. Have enclosed a fort containing 19 acre and 96 rods of ground and have ploughed and sewed about  1000 acres of wheat have fenced about 6000 acres of land Have built one saw mill and got a Cooncel House up the 1st story. This is an important point and probably will be  next to the great salt Lake in importance as they have found an abundance of coal and Iron    ENDENTRY May 11, 1851 ~ Sunday   11th Sunday It was a stormy day Br G. A Smith addressed  the meeting a short time and the people was dismissed    ENDENTRY May 12, 1851 ~ Monday   12th A company started out this morning to examine the coal and Iron the President and council remained in fort to hold a cooncil and do such business as was necessary. A meeting was called at 4 oclock to ascertain the minds of the Brethren it was found  about 30 wished to go home 15 to get their families and the other 15 to remain at the great salt Lake each one made there excuse President Young then addressed them and said he would express  his feelings upon the subject to those who wished to go home If you were now on a mission to England or any other  part of the Earth preaching the gospel you would not sit down  and council together about going to get your families or go  home untill your mission was ended. this is of quite as  much importance as preaching the gospel for the time has now  come when it is required of us to make the wilderness blos- som as the rose. Our mission now is build up stakes of Zion  and fill these mountains with cities and when your mission  is ended you are at Liberty to go and be free and ownly do right. When I go on a mission I leave my affairs in the hands of  God. If my house fields, flocks, wife or children die in my  absence I say Amen to it. If they live and prosper I feel to say Amen to it and thank the Lord. He wished the Brethren  to finish the fort and secure their grain andc wished the land to be surveyed so that the Brethren who laid the foundation could have their choice of farms. He councelled the Brethren to buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could and  educate them and teach them the gospel so that not many generations they would be a white and delightsom people for the Lord could not have devised a better plan than  to have put us whare we are in order to accomplish this  thing    ENDENTRY May 13, 1851 ~ Tuesday   13 The Saints assembled this morning and was addressed by  E. T. Benson in the morning who spoke lengthy in the afternoon the meeting was addressed By J M Grant and W Woodruff who expressed their feelings upon various subj- ects B Young followed and advised to have the logs so close  that arrows could not be shot into the fort. He would prefer to have many address the saints so as to get Ideas from many than  to have one occupy all the time. He wished the boundaries of the  citieys to be altered on the charter as their was a mistake in also the name was to be altered from PAROWAN   ENDENTRY May 14, 1851 ~ Wednesday   14th We rode to Red Creek to see the country we had a feast at  Brother Baylis House of the rich luxeries of Earth. Our exploreing  party returned from the coal and Iron mines brought specemins andc    ENDENTRY May 15, 1851 ~ Thursday   15th we rode to summit creek to day whare we could view the land and see the country 10 miles from the fort south we concluded to start home tomorrow. In the evening  In company with Elder Kimball I went to the water and saw  the Baptism of 6 persons Brother Kimball and myself confirmed them Brother Whipple and family was 3 of them    ENDENTRY May 16, 1851 ~ Friday   16th Met with the citizens to agree upon electing officers President Young said that he cared nothing about the feelings  of the Nations who had driven us out. we should not follow in the path and political foolary we should have one candidate  and but one as delegate to congress we can speak our feelings freely here but when we vote let it be for the candidate of our choice should we have two candidates and they have about  eqal votes the United States would know we had apostitized from our faith and union or we were trying to deceive them we would stand better in their eyes to take our own indepe- ndant course and act united. if we have but one track  the saints will walk on it if we have two tracks their will  be a plenty of Devils to run on them. If we begin right  we shall go right if we begin wrong we shall keep wrong the United States are afraid of our union and so is the world In speaking of the Indians he said these Indians were the  descendants of the old gadianton robers who infested these  mountains for more than a thousand years.   we dined together in the city of Parowan and then left  amid the roar of cannon and drove to red creek and camped  for the night. About 30 of the citizens returned with us  to go back to the Great Salt Lake City    ENDENTRY May 17, 1851 ~ Saturday   17 we left the valley crossed the mountain and camped on Beaver creek which abounds with Beaver and trout G. A. Smith  and several others came as far as this creek and camped with us    ENDENTRY May 18, 1851 ~ Sunday   18th Sunday we parted with George A Smith and his company  who returned to Parowan we drove to willow creek and camped I felt quite unwell through the day    ENDENTRY May 19, 1851 ~ Monday   19th we travled to chalk creek and camped for the night Brother Smoot and several others are quite sick with the  mountain fever I am quite unwell with it    ENDENTRY May 20, 1851 ~ Tuesday   20 several of the Brethren went to the chalk mines to get some  chalk they brought a quantity with them. I rode with Br Kimball to day all the sick are getting better we camped in dry valley we found the country filled with the best of  grass for cattle    ENDENTRY May 21, 1851 ~ Wednesday   21 We had a rainy morning we rode to the severe crosed it  and nooned the ox teams came up with us and crossed the ferry also, one waggon turned over in the river we drove to sage Hen creek and camped for the night I saw about a dozen Beaver play in the swamp at night   ENDENTRY May 22, 1851 ~ Thursday   22nd we had a good road to day we drove to salt creek Nooned then passed Mt Nebo and willow creek went to summit creek and camped we drove 36 miles to day    ENDENTRY May 23, 1851 ~ Friday   23rd we rode to Petetenich and to Battle creek and  camped    ENDENTRY May 24, 1851 ~ Saturday   24th we drove into the Smoot and Stewart quite sick they were glad to get home I took tea with Br and Sister Thomas Kingtons Left a  letter went on with the company to the city. An escort of  100 horseman came out to meet us we went into the city  amid the roar of canon I went home to my family and found them all well and we found on our return the Lord had  given our crops a plenty of rain it had rained 12 days in succession and the people were blessed. Little Salt Lake is 250 miles from Great Salt Lake so the whole distance  of our travel to and from was 500 miles   An Eastern mail arived an hour before we did and brought many papers FIGURE 25 And Letters I received 2 letters from I F Carter and one from Foster    ENDENTRY May 25, 1851 ~ Sunday   25th ^FIGURE^ Sunday The People assembled in the Bowery and filled the House President B Young addressed the meeting spoke of our Journey over the mountains and made many interesting remarks In the afternoon the meeting was addressed By W Woodruff E. T. Benson  and President Young then preached a loud sermon to the people told them if they went to the merchants as they had done and run in debt they would soon find themselves slaves to their  enemies and fools told the people to go to making leather and cloth and the women to card their wool and flak spin their flax and make  cloth and many plain and pointed things were spoken in the evening we met for Prayer and had a good time    ENDENTRY May 26, 1851 ~ Monday   26th In company with Father Thomas  Kingtons and spent the night 10 m    ENDENTRY May 27, 1851 ~ Tuesday   27th I went to fishing and caught 49 trout spent the night to Br Kingtons    ENDENTRY May 28, 1851 ~ Wednesday   28th I returned home 10    ENDENTRY May 29, 1851 ~ Thursday   29th I spent the day at home choreing    ENDENTRY May 30, 1851 ~ Friday   30th I spent the day hunting a lost cow rode 15 mils    ENDENTRY May 31, 1851 ~ Saturday   31st FIGURES I received a letter from Ilus F Carter conta- ining an Invoice of goods sent by Mr Monroe I wrote him one letter containing one sheet and a half giving him  what News I could    ENDENTRY June 1, 1851 ~ Sunday   June 1st 1851 Sunday when I arived at meeting President  Young was speaking and the following is a synopsis of his discourse "If a man does right he shall have the spirit of God  to enlighten his mind in all things yet all men will be  tryed, buffeted, and tempted more or less in this probation and he that governs himself is wise. If a man is unrighteously  angry he should let it sleep and not show itself untill he is right again. good men may be left to commit a gross sin but if he had watched closely he would have escaped the evil. the Lord intends all men to be tryed in this life and if you build   ENDENTRY your faith upon a true foundation that faith has got to be tryed  All men have an oppertunity of appearing wise or foolish  of governing themselves or making their folley manifest  Peter commit a gross error had he have been on the watch tower he might have turned away in silence and not denyed his  Lord. Many have been tryed and turned away from us  at a time when they expected to have gained sumthing by and in doing so they have lost all. Others have been blinded and  overcome and done evil then their eyes were open to see the conseq- uences. But it is the privilege of all men to live so that they  can see what each act will amount to either good or evil How  different the prospect would be before the world or this people if they would live so from what it now is. I endeavour to do right  in all things and then leave the event in the hands of God and am satisfy  with the result. If a man is led or tempted to do a thing that you do not comprehend the result of and that result ^not^ lead to good then let it alone.   During the past week one remarked to me that my observat- ions last sunday ought to be observed and was good but it ought to have  been spoken in the right spirit. But I wish to say that I am  satisfyed with the power and influence the Lord has given me. The Lord  directs things according to his own will, I know my feelings and zeal  would make my words like a sharp two edged sword so that they  would seperate the sins from this people that they should practice  sin no more not be tempted with it but this is not the will  of God the people still must have their warfare and trial and if the storms and waves overwhelm the ship still all is well for we have a good captain at the helm. Some people are vary anxious to reprove others while they are wrong themselves and do not know the spirit they are of theiry are ready to say How do you  do Peter and Judas Jesus, and How do you do Mr Devil And are  vary pious but will go to Hell with their spirit and the whole  world will go to Hell with the same spirit Awake ye Elders  of Israel and make your calling and election sure lest you go to  Hell with the wicked, I do not point you to the sectarian  Hell whare Devils are tosting you with a pitchfork in the  billows of Hell fire eternally. But go and mingle with the wicked in the states wrangle and fight with them get their spirit  and feelings and loose the light and spirit of God and you will begin  to feel the true state of the Damned. The wicked killed  Jesus Christ out of mallace and wickedness and they did not  know that His death was to save the world the Lord turns many things for good which the world means for Evil the whole Earth is filled with misery, sin and wickedness I  could find no worse Hell than to be confined among them I labour for the welfare of this whole people I wish my  Brethren to be a happy free people that their course of life may be such as to get an Eternal and temperal salvation  I labour to effect this, their is time and change to all things  Their has been a code of Laws given in former days which was for all people which is the gospel of Jesus Christ  In the dasyys of Christ the Apostles and Elders were sent out to preach the gospel and warn the people they did so but were  then martered for preaching it and the saints were killed off the Earth, that time is gone the change has come, for now   ENDENTRY the set time has come to favor Zion to build it up in strength power and glory to gather Israel to build Jerrusalem and Zion to fight for our liberty and freedom. we have sent the Gospel forth and preached the Book of Mormon and the minstry  of Jesus on this continent in Ancient days Now the time is come to gather Israel and polish them. Their is a great excitement in  the world about abolitioneist are vary fearful that  we shall have the Negro or Indian as lslaves Here we have a  few that were prisioners that we have bought to save their lives  but what will the Abolitionest do If you owe them a dollar they  will Jog you up. Neither will they liberate the slave by buying  them and setting them free. The Master of Slaves will be damned  if they Abuse their slaves. Yet the seed of Ham will be  servants untill God takes the curse off from them but they are  not all the slaves their is in the world. The whole world are  slaves to sin and wickedness and passion. Blacks  they are as free as I am. Shall we lay a foundation for  Negro Slavery No God forbid and I forbid. I say let  us be free. we will be rich but we must be rich in  faith first or we shall be rich in no other way. we must lay a foundation to manufacture our own goods if we do  not we shall be slaves to our enemies we must stop being  so much dependant oupon our enemies and a foreign market  or it will make us trouble and this people must sceace getting in debt to the merchants for if you will get in debt you  shall pay your debts but I say stop getting in debt let No one come to me and complain that he has got in debt and the  man will sue him and ought to be cut off from the church  for you that get in debt and wont pay your debts are the ones that ought to be cut off from the church. dont get in debt  go in the spring and get the bark off the shrub oaks their is enough  in this valley to tan $200,000 worth of leather, and here your  hiydes are roting over the Earth and your are paying 50 cts per lb  for leather and you pay the merchants $80,000 annually for shoes  but instead of persueing this course if you will lay a foundation  for taning leather making cloth making what we want you  then lay a foundation to build and sustain Zion. I drove sheep  to this valley and bought others and brought a carding machine  here to card wool who will put it up I have done more to  stock this valley than any 4 men in the place. I want  others to do sumthing set up the mashine and make the cloth is there  any woman in this valley who will make me a suit of clothes  so if I do not wear them. what is the spirit of the times  in the world if a woman pays a great price for an article  it is considered vary nice and all want some of the same but you get a thing cheap and all are ashamed to wear it you are looked  upon with disdain but if you pay a great price you are vary  respectable. their is many practices not right to see the men  ride through the streets they go as though they were in a hurry  to get to Hell. To men of wisdom such things look vain and foolish but to the world it looks glorious and the mark of fellowshiping with them is fine clothing and splendor, I want the saints to  adorn themselves first their hearts with faith and grace then their bodies with the workmanship of their own hands if  it is silk and satin all the better it will show your art   ENDENTRY wisdom and ingenuety in temperal things true friendship is not known on the Earth if it is not among this people But the  friendship of this people is the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ this must continue to improve untill they are perfect   In speaking upon the subject of tithing the President thought their had not Been $200 dollars paid in cash during the  past Year inby this people in tithing but they have paid the  merchants $200000 in cash, and their is now 30000 bushels  of wheat due on tithing. Shall we dispens with the Law of  Tithing. Dont you want a building to meet in to worship God  we want a Tabernacle, and a Temple for our Endowments  also a Tower to hang a bell on and we want to keep building up Zion that Israel may have a place of rest. if we do this we do our duty we have duties to perform and a warfare to accomplish but the victory will soon be ours the greatest  warfare is with ourselves if we can gain a victory with  ourselves so as to have peace with ourselves our wives and childn  we shall do well. many other interesting remarks were  made by the president.    In the afternoon the meeting was addressed by O Spencer  in an adifying manner. And was followed by Elder  Kimball who spoke much to the edifycation of the people  we had our prayer meeting in the evening and was in council untill 10 oclok    ENDENTRY June 2, 1851 ~ Monday   2nd June I spent the day at home    ENDENTRY June 3, 1851 ~ Tuesday   3, I went to  porters Mill and got a load of Lumber and  caught 15 trout    ENDENTRY June 4, 1851 ~ Wednesday   4th I went to see my herd of oxen that was brought down    ENDENTRY June 5, 1851 ~ Thursday to  ENDENTRY June 7, 1851 ~ Saturday   5th 6th 7th I spent the time about my labour    ENDENTRY June 8, 1851 ~ Sunday   8th Sunday President Young addressed a full assembly of the Saints as follows. I want to speak such things as are  in my heart. All that are acquainted with me know that my religion embraces all things that belong to the duties of life  The Religion I have embraces all the principles of present  future, progressive and Eternal Salvation in evry sens of the  word. I labour for the salvation of myself and my Brethren I would  be glad to speak to thousands even the whole world if they could  hear I would not like to preach in this house to 20 or 100 persons when more than 1000 could get in here then for 20 or 1100 more come  and have to preach 20 or 50 times to have the people learn when  they could learn it all at once. The President of the Seventies  called a separate meeting to day I come and dismissed it what if the  Twelve Seventies High Priest, Elders, priest, Teachers, Deacon and member should do the same there would be bear walls for the house to  preach to and what Good would it do. If the presidency of the seventies have such important things to lay before the quorum as to get them to -gether on sunday let them come and teach us all. I now want to  give council in this matter from this time forth and forever let  not the president of any quorum ever again call a separate meeting  from the public congregation unless the president of the Church order it. The seventies should be here and all the people should be here  let the seventies Hall go and all other business when Sunday comes   ENDENTRY let the Saints of God come together and hear the Elders teach Apply your hearts unto wisdom and get it. If I am full of  the spirit of God I shall not get any more than I want  It is the duty of all to come here that can come and let the  power of Eternity rest upon us and you should not be asleep  but wide awake. When I contrast the present with the past  situations of the Saints It gives me a great variety of feelings, both good and bad Joyful and sorrowful I have seen this people waiding through a school of affliction they then  were prayful and had faith their trying situation made  them remember the Lord their God. But now prosperity  is heaped upon you and as this people are to be tryed in all  things when prosperity comes some forget God wax fat  and rich do not realize the blessings they are enjoying. some  who are in poverty abroad desire to gather with the saints  when they arive and get rich they forget what they have  been. Could you see the feelings of thousands now  who are abroad who desire with all their hearts to come  here they would be willing to lick up the dust of your feet  if they could but be here they still are with the wicked  Bring them here they look upon many who were poor  but now rich, they then desire to be rich also they want  gold and will soon be willing to sacrifice the society of the  Saints and go to the gold mines and plunge themselves again into Hell as it were from whare they came to gratify an  unlawful desire thus it is with many men some were  to go to the Bear River and keep a ferry to get gold  and wait on wicked ungodly men to get gold whare are  their minds like the fools eyes. I told them I would  not wait on the devils for loads of gold I would rather stay here and serve the Lord. All I want of property is to serve the Lord and build up his kingdom with it. I suppose  many of the Brethren and Sisters are much tryed to think  they cannot have all they want. I will tell you what  to do, do all you can to day and let the rest go untill to morrow  do your duty to day and all will be right what  good would it do you to have 999 years to search and hear the revelations  and commandments of God if we have no time to carry one of  them out. If any one wants to get more revelations than they  improve upon they are greedy dogs. It will take 20 years to do the  work that God has revealed through the mouth of his servant  Joseph which he laid out for us to perform before his death  even during the last year of his life to say nothing of what he  gave before. I will tell you your duty. Command your minds from evry thing that is not for you to day and sit and worship God  not sit and sleep but worship the Lord today, go home at the close  of the meeting and get your food and rest then come to meeting again ponder and reflect upon the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ and his sufferi- ngs. if their is any thing necessary to be done do it if an ox or an  ass falls into the pit pull him out, drive any beast out of your Neigh bors grain and put up the fence. Do you meditate do you pray in  your families and in secret to get the spirit of God. you say you have my ^your^ tryials I have mine I will tell some of them Brethren will  come here to meeting on Monday morning go through my field leave  my fence down let their cattle and horses eat my wheat   ENDENTRY Borrow my cart waggon, shovel, hoe, ax and evry thing I have got and that to without liberty and never bring it home and if  it was not my duty to stay here I would lay my hands  upon some I could pick out who I have confidence in and would go and form a colony by myself and would not admit of any person who was not proven I cannot get grass in the Big field but many of you do it. But I now warn you not to  steal my wood nor any of my property for if you continue  to do it I will put a mark upon such men that they will carry all the days of their lives they are hypocritts and  think all others are the same I dont love them vary well Again I say to you it is not your duty to get in debt to these Merchants I say you shall pay your debts if you say you cant pay I say you shall pay them.   I speak of the faults of my  Brethren you may ask shall we forgive our Brother his trespas if he repents I say yes "How many times untill seventy times seven in one day if he repents and asks for it even all sins except the sin against the Holy Ghost. If you will bring back my tools grass and grain which you have taken unlawfully or any of my property and ask forgiveness I will return forgive you I will not cast off any man untill he cast himself off I will not reject any  man untill he rejects himself, I will hold on to any man as long as he has any prospect of salvation.    ENDENTRY June 9, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY June 14, 1851 ~ Saturday   9th 10th 11th 12 13th and 14 This week has been spent in hunting lost cattle, wattering wheat and common labour    ENDENTRY June 15, 1851 ~ Sunday   15th Sunday President Brigham Young addressed the congrega- tion of the Saints in the following words.   I would like to say enough in few words to fill three sermons I have had to deliver my discourses in few words. I wish the people to sustain the priesthood as the priesthood. As to the opin- ion of men concerning myself as a man I care no more about it than I do the dust under my feet. I dont care what you  say about me If you will ownly serve the Lord our God do the people live so as to know the voice of the Good shepherd. I wish to state one item here which concerns you seriously, that is concerning the Indians here. They are Ignorant have been taught to steel  and kill from their childhood and those who could do the most of it were considerd the greatest Braves and chiefs as soon as they begin to steal  here many of you want them killed compare their circumsta nces with your own. You are taught from your cradles not to steal or kill as it is a great crime now do you kill a white man as soon as he steals weigh this subject well. Those who wish them killed for stealing a horse reduce themselves far below the Indian. You love them as well as I do, but when the curse is taken off they will again be fit for society but while they  are in their degraded state it rests upon us to use wisdom and  judgment in their behalf. I say to the saints kill evry white  man you see stealing and not kill the Indian for it for the white men  know better. I speak to the saints not as the Govornor of Utah but you and I are sent to save Israel not to kill them. Evry Elder that croses a certain line I do not wish to see him but those who do right or seek to do right if they commit an error we will forgive them I do not ask for influence ownly what God gives me neither will I give any man influence ownly what the Lord and his own good   ENDENTRY conduct gives him for if God does not give a man influence all els will be of no use to him. If I do the work of God i all is  well but I will give no man influence ownly what God gives A Few words to families who have not a head to Govern will be destroyed. The man is the head of the family and should govern it. the hand may say to the head if I really thought you would govern right I would be governed by you but I am afraid you will not and I want to govern you and dictate the head then the shoulders and stomach will want to dictate but does not good sens teach you that your head should Govern your body your experience teaches the same. Your head dictates you what to do and when your head  dictates the body to do wickedly and pollute the body then the head should be cut off so as not to pollute the body any longer   G A Smith remarked that there was some bodies who could not act unless the belly told the head what to do. In the strict sens of the word no man is qualifyed to be judge and rule in the priesthood  untill he is qualifyed to rule himself, and be king over himself it is thus in families children and mothers Have you a good Husband and Father let the wife rule the Husband and she will keep him tied to the dish cloth and kitchen all the days of his life and it proves a curse upon him. Their is a curse upon man that  I would not take off if I could for in the experience you have you are led to salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ   Do you know your calling Mothers It is your duty to brace up your feelings as men have to do and be mystress of your house I go to the house to rest the Mother sayes I cannot govern the children I wish you would but this is not right the Elders of this church have to go abroad to preach the gospel they cannot be with their children when they come home to spend a little time they want to daudle their children upon their knee and not go to whiping them the Mother should govern them wuntill the sons go with their Fathers in the field then let the Father Govern I can govern my children when  they are with me I would rather one of my sons would stab me to the heart and kill me dead than to conquer and  master me in government when any undertake to  govern out of their place they do not prosper. As an ensample John Taylor undertook to govern and controll and set right my affairs at winter Quarters while I was on  a pioneer Journey to the Mountains and they liked to have destro yed many but I said peace be still and I saved the people I say to Mothers in the Name of the Lord God of Israel do your  duty dont ask the Father to whip the child do it yourself if  necessary and let Mothers controll their daughters untill they go to their Husbands, but let the Man rule and preside over his household and I say to the Men do not go home and abuse your wives becaus of what I have said but treat them kindly what would you think of a man who would get up before a glass and cut and tear his own heart out as well of him as I would  of a man who would beat and abuse his wife.    President Richards remarked Evry man makes his own Hell or Heaven if we keep the commandments and do right we have a Heaven within us all the time 40 Men and all the devils in Hell cannot make a Hell for us if we do right but if you stop to parley with the devil he will soon get the advantage over you and make a Hell for you   ENDENTRY FIGURE During the evening we met for prayer after which the president  taught us much to our edifycation. The spirit should controll the body the monitor whispers to the mind of man when it does wrog wrong and sayes this is wrong points out the right path and sayes walk ye in it the soul or spirit of man wants feeding as well as the body or it  will dry up and wither like the quakers and other sects   A Mormon boy will whip out the priest we will advance untill we can stand in the society of the gods, then let us do right and keep the commandments of God in all things. Our knowledge comes by experience it is Necessary that we should have crosses and trials of all kinds  in order to gain knowledge by experience if we overcome we  get a great victory continue to do so untill we arive at our high  stations to become Gods Organize worlds and controle them. All our passions God gave us but we must controll them and make a right use of them. Our spirits were pure from Eternity but  condescended to take a body in its impure state was married  to it will continue with it through time in mortality through  Eternity in Immortality. In speaking of the married state sayes if man and wife become alliniated from each other it is in one sens the spirit of adultery    ENDENTRY June 16, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY June 21, 1851 ~ Saturday   16th 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21, this week was spent hunting lost cattle and at hard labour    ENDENTRY June 22, 1851 ~ Sunday   22nd Sunday President Young addressed the saints as  follows. If I can see the motives of the heart of man and know  Eternal things by the spirit of God it is far more beautiful  than to hear their words of men. should an Angel come and convers with any man in the congregation No other one might know it. He would think the person spoke to him as one speaks to another face to face when he would not be seen at all ownly by the spirit of God or by vision. we may know by the spirit of God what is in a mans heart before he speaks, at all times listen  to the still small voice of the spirit of God and it will save the saints from many snares. If you get angry dont sin nor let the sun go down upon your wrath I do not expect perfection in men  not what the world calls perfection I have seen a perfect prophet and perfect Apostles, that is perfect in their calling. But not the perfection the world looks for. If Joseph had been as perfect as the people wished him to be he could not have lived with the people nor stayed this side of the veil as long as he did, we could not have herd his voice nor seen his face. He would have had to been veiled Israel could not endure the face of Moses at times. The Lord exp- ects us to be in the path of Duty when we get in Eternity we shall be Angels or Goods we shall their advance to the God head  if we do right.   In speaking of the Law what a simple thing it is what is the Law to those who do right. It is not made for any body but the transgresser and lawless and wicked. If we do not infringe upon the rights of others all things are ours in Heaven and Earth time and Eternity Life and Death Heaven Earth and Hell and all that is therein is ours if we do not infringe upon the rights of any other being we shall become Gods and fill immensity as our Father in Heaven does I can weigh all the sleepers philosophers, and Learned men of the Earth in the scale and know just what they weigh and can cir cumscribe them all. All is mine Heaven Earth, Hell wives children   ENDENTRY and I am Christs and Christ is Gods. It is not known to us whare the stakes are set to Gods immensity. Take the world at large and they get to the end of their chain when they get to the mill  pond. It is a startling Idea to think we are worshiping a God  that once was once in the situation that we are in ourselves they had to pass through a probation of pain, suffering and the fall like ourselves and He made perfect through sufferings. The Son of God passed through it and the Father would not require of a son  what He would not do Himself. All our sufferings will exhalt us in the presence of God if we endure them patiently. A word of advice concerning lawing I dont never want to hear of another law suit among the Brethren. Is it anything but good common sense to Never have another suit before a judge to say nothing of revelation. It does not require any great perfection to  accomplish this, let men do right do your Neighbour good not evil. The Lord will burn up the Earth to cleanse it as you would an old pipe. You think it hard to have to water your land here but it is far more healthy than to have rain it was so in Egypt if it did not rain in Missouri more than here it would be far more healthy this could be reasoned out on Natural  principles. A word more upon Law suits their would not be a Lawsuit in this valley if all men would do right and were saints but the net has gathered all kinds good bad and worse let twelve men get drunk in this community and it ruins the place in the estimation of of good men we have to bear the character of the drunkard a few stinking fish in the net defile it. and the whole net stinks and it creates a prejudic against it. Those who were acq- uainted with Joseph know that if he delt any in temporal  things it created a prejudice against him. He bought many goods to help carry on the public works but the people were ready to get it all away from him. So it is now but I say unto  all men who are saints put to your hands and help build up Zion and the Kingdom of God we are scholars in the great school and must  learn we are a kingdom and must bring the kingdom in subjection to the will of God    ENDENTRY June 23, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY June 28, 1851 ~ Saturday   23rd 24th 25, 26, 27 ^and 28^ This week was spent in prepareing to build    ENDENTRY June 29, 1851 ~ Sunday   289th Sunday President Young remarked I Join in testimony  with the Brethren I wish to be a doer of the word I feel the import ance of the remarks of the last speaker Brother Spencer those who are not ready to meet the Bridegroom will not be invited  to the supper and the time is near. Jesus Christ is an ensam- ple to all Saints, He was filled with wisdom in his youth but in his childhood and infancy He was like other children. It has  been said that He was in infancy wise as in manhood but this is not the case He was subject to temptation as we are but was not overcome by it. If we have become acquainted with our follies let us put them away and apply our hearts unto wisdom. let us have  compassion on others as we wish God to have compassion  on us we should increase in wisdom untill the day of redemption No person can receive all at once but increase little by little untill the day of perfection. Apply our hearts to wisdom and it will produce peace, health, wealth and evry good thing. should you see a people carry out the principles of wisdom peace would be the fruit and   ENDENTRY you would never see contention unto the day of your death Ask the world if they do not like a people who live in peace and are  contented and they will say yes it is beautiful take the world at  the present time and they are like wolves eat each other up they  fight and contend and devour each other the abolitionest become heated  and say the Negro must be made equal to the white man at the table and all other places they will at the same time turn away the widow and  orphan and put into prision a poor man for debt, and deprive him of his time to pay the debt, instead of this we should feed the  hungry and do good to all men as we have an opportunity  then we have a Zion it is peace in the heart we should  bear an evil from a Friend as well as an Enemy you ask the  Lord to bear with your infirmities so we should bear with  each other. what is the necessity of doing wrong having law suits and contending with each other go to Law and spend $100 to collect $5. you may be told you are independent and have rights  you have a right to do good and not evil. The God I serve will  deal out good to his saints and evry thing that is necessary  for them and reveal his will unto them, and teach them what  to do He will not lie or decieve me I will ask O Lord  did you do this or that did you bless this man or that man  so and so or did you suffer that evil to be so and so yes I  have done this to try men so and so, do you want me to do  so and so. If I am going to do a thing I ask is it the will of  God if I cannot get the will of God upon it I refuse to do it lest I do a thing wrong, we want to do right then we  prosper. is the people doing right is the kingdom growing is their principles in this kingdom to govern all men with  All that the Nations of the Earth Now possess would not make  this people happy as they now are. Give us the kingdom of God  instead of the glories of the world. their has been a great stir to  exhalt the Negro and make him equal to the white man but  there is a curse upon the seed of Cain and all Hell cannot wipe  it out and it cannot be taken off untill God takes if off  when a person unlawfully seeks for power and exhaltation  by taking the blessings which belongs to another he will  sink far below the other. As Lucipher the son of the morning sought the glory that belonged to Christ the first born  He was thrust down to Hell. so Cain sought Abels blessi- ng and took the life of his brother the consequence was  Cain was cursed and his seed and this curse will remain  untill Abels posterity will get all the blessing their is  for him then the curse may be taken from Cain or  his posterity but his posterity will be below Abels. All are slaves Polititions are the worst slaves and if we dont do right we shall ketch the lash we are the freest  people on Earth. Queen Victoria is a slave had to ask  the liberty to marry prince Albert but we are free we have  the right God and kingdom let isus not dishonor God His kingdom  or our Brethren if we do we shall sink below them and their  children. If the wife dishonors the Husband the children will dishonor the Mother and she must welter under it  Honour the priesthood in all its parts. Be more faithful be  more prudent. Administer to the wants of all as far as you  can I will not quarrel with my neighbor about the water   ENDENTRY if I loose the wheel for if my Neighbors raises wheat I  can obtain some of it to eat. Other remarks were maid by the speaker    ENDENTRY July 1, 1851 ~ Tuesday   July 1st I commenced laying adobies in my house this day    ENDENTRY July 2, 1851 ~ Wednesday to  ENDENTRY July 3, 1851 ~ Thursday   2 and 3 We continued building the house    ENDENTRY July 4, 1851 ~ Friday   July 4th In celebration of the Independance of America  the City of the great Salt Lake poured forth her inhabitants who  went forth in good order with her Legion of mighty men  As an Escort to the state. The company  organized at the Temple square and started at 9 oclok in the  morning to take a ride to the great Salt Lake their was about  140 carriages of waggons besides the Horsemen the car  containing the Band of Musicions was drawn by 16 mules we  arived at the rock on the Lake at 2 oclock A.M p.m. we had  a meeting was addressed by Govornor Young and several  Orators who spoke much to the edifycation of the people in  the evening many went into the salt lake to bathe at 10 oclk the signal was given for prayers when all assembled in  the carrell or circle and prayer was offered up before  God and the encampment retired to rest we were 24 miles  from the city    ENDENTRY July 5, 1851 ~ Saturday   5th At 10 oclok AM all the teams were hitched up and  we returned to the City of the Great Salt Lake in the same  Order that we came out. It was as plesant a forth of  July as I ever spent my own family and Sister Foss and her  family went out together in a large family waggon  drawn by 4 Horses    ENDENTRY July 6, 1851 ~ Sunday   Sunday 6th President Young remarked we get good  from all men who speak by the spirit of God and according to their  calling I speak free so may all men. If we speak  incorrect we should be corrected we want to speak free that  we may gather good whether it is in the past present or to  come Brother Kempton has been speaking. He professes to  be a scholar I do not, but he has murdered the English language  today I want speakers to speak the English language correctly  for our children sake. As to principles their is no principles  in Heaven Earth or Hell but what the Saints have to appley to  their proper place. If we could understand all things we should know that here is the place to begin to make the people happy if we could understand the dealings and providences of God  with us and the object of it their would not be the discontent  and murmerings of the people that their now is but we should  have peace Joy and contentment. Concerning spiritual  and temporal things I would say that temporal and spiritual  things are one but what we call temporal are the courser  things which we see with our Eyes but the finer or spiritual  things we cannot see with our Eyes unless they are touched  by the spirit of God. Then we could see spiritual things to say the spiritual eye cannot see temporal things is folly but it looks unnatural to see people put out their own eyes to  spite their Neighbor. Anciently God Angels and Eternal things   ENDENTRY were considered Natural my mind can see many things when clothed with the spirit of God that my Eyes cannot. In speaking of Hell it is called vary hot but our God is a consumeing fire. Hell is here it is said the devil was  cast down to the Earth also that he was cast down to Hell He is in our midst striveing to lead captive the children of men I want the Brethren to speak freely to speak all that is in you and if you have an Error let it out and exchange it for true principle. some of the Saints  want more Revelation mysteries, great things, but do they know what  they ask for or what they have already got if the request of many men  was granted it would be like casting pearles before swine they would trample them in the mire we have enough now of the key words and tokens to take us through the veil into the celestial world and lead us to the Throne of God, and what more do you want. Have you ever pondered in  your hearts by visions and the spirit of God Eternal things even the redeeming of all worlds from there down to the smallest things God has made Have  you ever reflected upon the great system of salvation of the creatures  of God Is man contented He is not. Can man alter the decrees of God concerning the seed of Abraham or any thing els He cannot why not quarrel about Christ coming instead of the Father when the Father appointed Jesus Christ the first born to come and  redeem the Earth there was contention got up the second brother Lucipher the son of the morning He wanted the honour to come and redeem  the Earth but Christ was the Appointed one it was his right by appoin tment and birthright. But the war and contention became so hot and the  influence of Lucipher was so great that he got one third of the hosts of Heaven to Join his standard and when he was hurled down to Hell like lightning from Heaven one third was cast down with him whare is he and those that were cast down, with those spirts that accompanied him they are here on this Earth and they have blinded the child ren of men and still seeking to overthrow the kingdom of God He is a thorn in the flesh to the children of God but this is all right and we should be contented with what God sees fit to grant unto us and to contented with our lot. If the devil had been contented and acted in  his place he would not have been thrust down to Hell. Any man who seeks to do a thing that he cannot do and should not do it cast him  into Hell and makes a Hell for him when men ask for things that  does not belong to him and it makes him unhappy. But do what  God wants you to do and wait on those who are above you and all  will be right. why did not one of the Apostles quarrel with  Jesus Christ to redeem the world Jesus set a little child in  their midst and said if ye do not become as this little child you  cannot enter into the kingdom of God. If you would be the  greatest man in the kingdom of God you must be the greatest slave  or servant you will do more than any other man. The Apostles  did not quarrel to know who should or should not be president why do I or you not quarrel because we were not Joseph Smith to want to and cannot is Hell. Never seek to do a thing you cannot  accomplish. Evry man has his lot appointed him and he should be  contented with it. Their is the work of God, Angels, men and Devils  Is the Bible good the Book of Mormon Doctrins and Covenants yes they are good those Book contain the words of God Angels men and Devils. And if you dont want to be in Hell all the time be contented with your lot if you dont learn to be contented you will be in  Hell with Brother Kempton who sayes he was in Hell one year   ENDENTRY then learn to be contented and you will be happy dont complain  because you are not God, Jesus Christ, an Angel, Brigham a man, a woman a Father a Mother, a son a daughter or  any thing els but be contented with the lot in which God has placed you then you will be happy and blessed. The Blacks cannot  take the curse off themselves untill God takes it off make all  men saints and they will treat each other well. So the Laman- ites are cursed but is there not blessings for them yes the same  as their is for the Saints for Joseph Brigham and Jesus Christ and all Faithful men and women in their time and season so be contented    ENDENTRY July 7, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY July 12, 1851 ~ Saturday   7th 8th  9th 10th 11 and 12 This week was spent in building my house except Monday the 7th I spent in the council House with my  Brethren labouring in the duties of my office    ENDENTRY July 13, 1851 ~ Sunday   13th Sunday met as usual at the Sherwood preached in the forenoon a lengthy discourse which was edifying to the people In the afternoon Elder E D Woolley and  President Young spoke. Among the Presidents remarks he said why should we not know our own talents and abilities as well  as others if we do not their is sumthing lacking. concerning singing theire isare some men who know sound and others do not and those  who do not know sound ought not to sing, we should act  upon what we do know and let the rest go Sherwood said he  thought we were kicked out of the fire into the frying pan President Young said we were kicked out of the fire into  the middle of the floor when this people get their eyes open so as to see that their interest lies in building up  of the kingdom of God then the kingdom of God will roll on  and the people will do better    ENDENTRY July 14, 1851 ~ Monday   14th I spent the day in the council chambers with my  Brethren I herd two interesting letters read from our  Friend and Brother Col Kinkade had a large train of goods arive to day    ENDENTRY July 15, 1851 ~ Tuesday   15 some of the government officers and their train arived  to day    ENDENTRY July 16, 1851 ~ Wednesday to  ENDENTRY July 19, 1851 ~ Saturday   16, 17, 18 and 19 I spent the time building my house Bulah Augusta born this 19, July 1851    ENDENTRY July 20, 1851 ~ Sunday   20th Brother Kempton was vary anxious to preached  from text Abrams bosom liberty was granted him  and he went ahead but did not do much President Young  followed and said Brother Kempton has had his liberty as is given to evry man who speaks here he has not satisfyed his mind at all he may have much in his mind but can  say but little here. He is not able to handle the scriptures and know all the spirits in the world as some can when the dark sayings in the scriptures are understood they are plain. The scripture here that speaks of Abrams bosom is not as given by Br  Kempton Abram is in paradise Lazarus is with him ##Luke 16:20-25## for me to explain is to tell the truth a man that feels and  talks to the people should be a Bible of himsel if a man that   ENDENTRY teaches and leads the people is not filled with truth so as to be able to  teach the people without quoting the teachings of others altogether is a blind guide and will go to Hell with those he leads. It is the intenti- on of the Lord to teach men principle in progression untill he  shall know all things, that he may arise through faith power and victory untill they obtain evry good thing even to arise  to be Gods even the Sons of God which blessing we cannot obtain without experience we should not sin when we are  tryed and tempted but overcome which will give us glory  honor and eternal life as fast as I improve upon what I have more will be given me. The Saviour was subject to all that we were  from his birth to his death. He applyed his heart unto wisdom we should do so to apply our hearts unto wisdom from day to  day and you will receive all that He did. If I through out  all that is in me what faults I have will give place for truth  and that is good I feel to praise the Name of God for all  He has done for me. My heart is like Aminidab continually all persons see times when they wish truth to prevail. Mormonism is all theruth the Lord has raised up a Prophet and Seer who brought it forth and esstablished it. He was faithful unto death and sealed  his testimony with his blood. A certain prophecy sayes when  the Book of Mormon shall come unto the gentile the Jews shall  be gathered at Jerrusalem. All truth is ours in Heaven Earth and Hell it is all the truth we want. But does the church or Elders  want correcting yes for they have errors and fals botions the net  has all kinds of fish we have some as cursed rascals among  us as dwell on the Earth and we find Evil here as well as any  whare els. Yet Zion is here it is in my heart peace dwells  with me and good principles will prevail Here untill all evil is overcome even in all the Earth let no man find fault with  his Neighbor untill He is righteous I dont ask any thing of others that I wont do myself and never find fault with  another about any thing you allow in yourself dont you sware, scold, and do wrong yourself then dont find fault with another for it untill you subdue your own passions  and the Evil that is in yourself some will do any thing to preside over another when they cannot preside over  themselves. Now remember this that we will have Zion  when all wickedness is gone. we have got to fight fight fight untill we gain the victory over ourselves. Remember  this and overcome what is the feelings of my heart it is to bless the people and do them good    ENDENTRY July 21, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY July 23, 1851 ~ Wednesday   21, 22 and 23rd spent the time on my house    ENDENTRY July 24, 1851 ~ Thursday   JULY 24th  FIGURE This is an important day with the saints  of God in thes vallies of the mountains  The following is an extract from the Deseret News   "The celebration of the 24 of July" The Anniversary of the enter- ance of the Latter Day Saints Pioneers into the valley of the Great Salt Lake. The approach of the rising king of Day was hailed  by the roar of cannon and the stillness of the morning was broaken  by the moveing of the mammoth carriage of the Nauvoo Brass Band  sending forth on the wings of the morning its sublime straines  of martial and cheering music and the citizens of Great Salt Lake   ENDENTRY shot forth from their domestic circles dressed as in the robes of  beauty concentrating towards the scene of a congregated throng  of life whare the ebullitions of Joy the rose of Health the glaness of intelligence and the combined feelings of an united and redeemed  people shed a lustre of glory through all the congregated Saints   "The order of the day was kept up by the fireing of cannon 110  times the organization and parading of streets by an escort consisting  of the Nauvoo Brass band the Military Band the Pioneers of 47 the Regency, the aged Fathers, young lads, followed by  the Mothers in Israel young girls, young men and young women  the Presidency with the officers of State formed the escorted party in their rear were 24 Bishops forming a phalanx of  the combined wisdom and strength of the Kingdom of God in the last days the numerous flags and banners the various emblems of art  agriculture, and industry and the music accompanying the procession from the presidence residence to the Bowery could ownly be surpassed  in the Armies of heaven   The bursts of feelings by music, singing, speeches, orations, toasts the order of arangement during the exercises in the Bowery was beyond  the most exquisite calculation of the most fastidious and was unsur- passed by any preceding it among the most refined and civilized  nation on Earth. Here was the power of truth the literature  of Gods spirit, the Eloquence of Apostles, the laws of the kingdom  of Heaven, the songs of Zion sung not in a strange land and the  harps hung not upon the willows the beauty and ornament of the  beau ideal of mans existence the ladies of Deseret the Heroism  of the valiant of the Earth and the Enjoyment of the luxuries and  productions of a consecrated land in all its richness and  profusion and the enjoyment of contentment   The closing shades of evening came over the city without the  alloy of any accident to mar the procedings of the hallowed day no curses of a drinking rabble no feelings of an ignorant or  Jealous bigotry, no effusion of party strife but all that could  elevate the mind of man and add to the enjoyment of a social and civilized.   Among the speeches made was an interesting one from W W. Phelps   In many respects this was the most interesting day of my  life. My Father, myself, and my children making three  generations in the linage of my Fathers was in that Grand  Escort to Honor the Holy Prophets of God while on their  march from President Tabernacle which  was filled with the Saints of the Most High    ENDENTRY July 25, 1851 ~ Friday to  ENDENTRY July 26, 1851 ~ Saturday   25 and 26 I spent the time about my dwelling    ENDENTRY July 27, 1851 ~ Sunday   27th Sunday I attended meeting we had a good day. Brother  Kimball addressed the meeting a part of the day among other remarks He said Jesus Christ was the first Born of the Father and He was  the candidate and elected to redeem the world. Lucipher set up as a candidate to run against Jesus Christ but He was overcome  and thrust down to Hell with all that followed him and we will have no more division henceforth and forever in Israel we will have but one  candidate for office but No opposition. All will be elected and  proven. If a person is qualifyed to fill a greater station than he holds   ENDENTRY He will have a chance. The Presidency and Twelve will fill in Eternity  those stations appointed them so with all men but I expect to  remain on this Earth untill I am able to create a world of my  own and people it the lord has given us rich portions of the Earth to inherit we have been driven from tim to time from there we now inherit a goodly land the best land on the Earth for vegitation and it will be good for fruit and the people of the Earth will yet come to us for fruit    ENDENTRY July 28, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY July 31, 1851 ~ Thursday   28, 29, 30, 31 I spent in my Harvest field    ENDENTRY August 1, 1851 ~ Friday to  ENDENTRY August 2, 1851 ~ Saturday   Aug 1st and 2nd I spent harvesting I had 20 acres of wheat 5 acres  of 7 headed wheat was vary stout supposed to yield 60 or 70 bushels to the acres I had 10 acres of touse and 5 acres of club    ENDENTRY August 3, 1851 ~ Sunday   3rd Sunday I attended meeting Dr Bernhisel accupyed the time  in the forenoon giving an account of his procedings in washington also his obtaining a library for Deserett    ENDENTRY August 4, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY August 9, 1851 ~ Saturday   4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 I spent this week harvesting and going to Dr Richards kanyon which was a horrid road    ENDENTRY August 10, 1851 ~ Sunday   10th Sunday I attended meeting Brother Babbit attended  meeting and addressed the assembly in the forenoon mostly upon the gospel  and priesthood    ENDENTRY August 11, 1851 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY August 16, 1851 ~ Saturday   11, 12 and 13 ^14 15 and 16^ I spent the time mowing and harvesting    ENDENTRY August 17, 1851 ~ Sunday to  ENDENTRY August 20, 1851 ~ Wednesday   14 15 16 17 17 Sunday I was unwell and was at home 18 19 and 20 I laboured    ENDENTRY August 21, 1851 ~ Thursday to  ENDENTRY August 23, 1851 ~ Saturday   FIGURE 214 225 and 263 I spent the time in council with some 40 or 50  men and they were some of the best days of my life much good was done light truth and the power of God was manifest difficulties of long standing between men were settelled the power of God was upon president Young who is made by the power  of God a great good and glorious man and a Father indeed to the church and kingdom of God    ENDENTRY August 24, 1851 ~ Sunday   24th Sunday Elder O Hyde addressed the meeting and said  the floods in the western states had been exceding high so much so that many could not emigrate there were  about 700 waggons on the way. The spirit of emigration was among all Nations the seas were white with the  sails of evry Nation who were emigrating to this country  to find a home many might embrace the Gospel and come to Zion and help builb it up. The feelings of the saints are  if I can get to the valley then I shall be happy then some want to go to Iron county and and to Sandiego then they would not be satisfyed and people wish to emigrate to another world and think when they get to Heaven their sorrow will end but their will  be things for us to reach after still when we are there and it will continue through all Eternity. Their is many Novels written and painted out but we do not want fals things to inter est us. But Just look into the Book of Nature and evry thing whether it looks up or down points to God. God is seen  in it all. Evry substance is surrounded with an atmosphere and in some respects shows what is within   ENDENTRY so their is an atmosphere surrounds all persons which you  feel when you meet with them, some persons atmosphere you  light like others you do not with some you feel safe other you do not it is so in meeting with families. Jesus said when you go into a house let your peeace dwell upon it but if they do not receive you let your peacece return unto you again. This is true doctrin (let my atmosphere be good so that the spirit of God and  good men may dwell with me in peace for that person who dwells near the Lord and has an Eye single to his glory can tell whether he  has the spirit of God or not when he meets with him many bodies are opake and not luminous but when the light of a lumin ous body strikes them it sets them all in a blaze so with one  who has the spirit of God when his spirit rests upon another it overshadows him it sets him in a blaze and the great light can see the Heart. We are all as it were painters painting our own characters and evry good deed will give our sign a  white coulor and evry wicked deed a black colour and when we have painted unto the End of our days our character will be  presented before God in its true light and we shall see as we are seen and know as we are known some think the Judgment will not be untill after the resurrection of some thousands of years but remember that when you lie down at night and are weary and fall asleep before you are aware of it the morning comes the time is past and you are awoke. But in the church and kingdom of God what is sealed on Earth is sealed in Heaven what is bound on Earth is bound in Heaven and if a man sins he is soon brought into Judgment for now is the Judgment  with him. God will Judge the world but He may not Judge one individual Himself but His servants will Judge them under his  direction. It is said the saints will Judge Angels but what Angels why fallen Angels for those Angels who remain in Heaven are now above us while those who are fallen are below us for who is better able to Judge them than the Saints who  cast them out. Many other interesting remarks were made by Elder Hyde.   Elder H. C. Kimball arose and said the remarks of Elder Hyde were good and I will apply them and I want all to lift up their  sign and I want to imitate the best painted sign in Israel  and the character that is most like God I never expect to see a time in all Eternity but what I shall have to abide a law  be trimmed and scourged untill I am a fit subject to become a  God. If you get into Heaven and rebell you will be cast out their is always danger of falling as long as we are going up a  ladder.    ENDENTRY August 25, 1851 ~ Monday   FIGURE Aug 25th FIGURE I spent the day in council with my Brethren and while in the council the mail arived from  the States in 20 days from Independance the largest ever recieved  about 400 lbs I received 3 letters one from Thompson  and one from Ilus. My Brothers Azmon and Thompson Woodruff informed me in their letters that my Step Mother Azubah Woodruff  Died FIGURE March 20th March 20th 1851 at 7 1/2 oclok P.M. and that  that my Brothers Azmons wife Elizabeth Woodruff  Died FIGURE Jan 3rd January 3rd 1851 Both were own sisters by birth I found   ENDENTRY from Brother Azmons letter that he was in much sorrow he was  baptised into the church of Jesus christ of latter day saints with  myself the last of Dec in 1833 He was ordained an Elder and  myself a teacher in the church under the Hands of Zerah Pulsipher  Elizabeth my Brothers wife with the assistance of the Devil made  war on my Brother and soon caused him to leave the church he  has been in sorrow ever since with the help of the Lord I now  intend to feel after my brethren and bring them here that they  may be saved. On my arival home with my letters I called  My aged Father into the Room with me and red him the letters  from his two oldest sons containing an account of the death of  both his own wife and his sons wife he was quite resigned to the  providence of God in these things    ENDENTRY August 26, 1851 ~ Tuesday to  ENDENTRY August 29, 1851 ~ Friday   26, 27, 28, 29, I spent a part of the time in council and a part of it in the Harvest field  Brother Iron County  on the 28th in good health    ENDENTRY August 30, 1851 ~ Saturday   30th I was in council with the Elders and herd a long letter red  from Lorenzo Snow    ENDENTRY August 31, 1851 ~ Sunday   31 Sunday Elder G.

Richards of  the Quorum of the Twelve G. A. Smith  and E. T. Benson. The first seven presidents of the Seventies with the other Quoroms and a large congregation of Saints   President H. C. Kimball arose and said the conference was  not for the benefit of one but for the whole. Is the store House full of wheat is the tithing butter and cheese brought in. some  of you will ask can I get my Endowment but I will say not one  of you will get your endowments untill you pay your tithing  Prayer by O Hyde then singing.   ENDENTRY President Young arose and said as far as you can exercise patience  you should do so, we are oin comfortable circumstances and now let  us sit here and worship God and let our business rest and let us reflet  a little and exercise ourselves in our religion let our houses rest and  farms and crops let the people be still and not talk in the house or about the  window. In my meditations I am like other men who reflet and I marvel to see men so intent upon objects that  will so soon perish. How many their are here who ask the  question how long will this Conference last I want to go I cannot  stop and others will be willing to stop and worship God some  spirits are like the troubled sea uneasy. If I could have my  wish about it I would wish such spirits to pass out of our  midst leave the congregation and let us worship in peace. We  are such an industrious people that we could not commence  conference untill Sunday. I care as little about our gardens  farms lumber andc as you do about snuffing ashes. If you get  all the riches of the world you cannot Hold them. If you will  get the wisdom it is your privilege to possess you will know  that God cares more for you than the ravens if you seek  the Kingdom of God and its righteousness the Lord will add  all things els that is necessary. Our first duty is to  provide for our families but we must take a course to accom plish it. Fools are often rich and the wise in begery this is the  providence of God we may be ever so rich to day we may be beggars to morrow thise is the case with those who are before  me let me draw the line between the Good and Evil Have you not had more good than Evil more than you would had if you had been in  the world more peace than in the world and happiness than in the meditation  of the things of God than in the world yes you have then shame on  the man who complains of his hardship the worst persecutions of the  people are their best days. I went to Mo in 1834 walked 2000 miles in  70 days was so weak I could not step over the fence 3 feet high. I now  have better health and strength than ever before I would not give all Geauga County for the experience I have had in 6 months. Now stay  here dont go home untill conference Ends. Many of the Saints forget  mormonism any body who Enjoy the light of the revelations of  Jesus Christ must have the spirit of God the FIGURE key to mormonism  is all the truths their is all Eternity that was ever revealed or ever will be that exhists with God Angels or men. whare shall I  go to Find truth in Mormonism. If you get a truth any whare it  is there as that covers all truth when the light came to me  sin did not revive in me and I died but I revived and lived I  had not consented to the death of any good man like Stephen as Paul did. But let him come to any of the Churches reared  in honour to his name and the world would kill him if they could  I will ask you are you excepted accepted of the Father and Son you will say I dont know, well it is because your minds are taken up with the things of the world then let us stay here untill we do know  I am a Mormon or what is called so and I know that Joseph  was a prophet. It was revealed to me long before his death  I always thought while reading the Bible about a prophet that I  would go around the world to see one or any man who knew things as they were and not have to guess at them. Evry thing will have  to bow to Mormonism or Eternal light and truth we have the true  government of all the Earth I know the path this people has to walk   ENDENTRY I am prepared for Mormonism there was no better man  than Joseph Smith ever lived on the Earth. Hear it O ye Heavens  O ye Earth and all men this is my testimony that he is theas good a man as ever lived save Jesus. The world will not vote for  a man because his religion governs they will not have God govern  them because of their cursed meanness but if God did not or can not dealedout Justice and rule in righteousness who can   E T Benson spoke to edifycation said some bore record of the things of God as they were revealed to them others believe on their testimony  the servants of God bind and seal on Earth and it is bound and sealed in Heaven I bear testimony that we have a prophet that will hold  the keys of the kingdom of God through all Eternity also a Patriarch both have sealed their testimony with their blood  for the cause and kingdom of God Mormonism is true and the keys of the kingdom of God are with you the presidency of the church who  now live with us and are righteous men the Twelve, High priest,  High Council, Seventies and Elders of Israel are righteous men  Joseph said we went into the little End of the Horn and came out  of the big End of the Horn. Any thing is ours if we are faithful and do the will of the Lord.   O Hyde took the floor and said this is one of the happiest  periods of my life. The testimony of all is good if the Brethren  who have spoken have broaken a clean loaf still I may gather  few crumbs we are living in the most important age and  when the Greatest events are to take place evry thing is on the  move the testimony of this work will go through the Earth and  the Lord will arise out of His hiding place and reign King  of Nations as He does now king of Saints, this would destroy all the Governments of the Earth. Do the Latter day Saints  wish the Nations of the Earth any Evil No we would save  them all if we could. But it was a mercy anciently to cut  off the wicked from the Earth that their posterity should not  inherit the Earth to follow the wickedness of their fathers  Gog and Magog will ere long gather to fight against the Saints of the  Lamb of God and when hope is almost fled Christ will come and End the scenery. If a prophet has been schooled in the  society of the Gods to come to the Earth as a prophet to do a  work for the kingdom he has the power of God with him to help him do it the same as we ordain a man to build  up a county whare we cannot go so when a prophet  comes he comes holding the keys of the kingdom of  God and binds and seals on Earth that which is bound and sealed  in Heaven   G A Smith arose and said if I did not know the truth I should not have taken the pains I have to preach it to the world and act the part I have in it but I know that God has sent a  Prophet to us and ordained a Priesthood and set up his kingdom  on Earth and a religion that is not evry thing is nothing Jesus broke bread and said Eat in rememberance of me and  this do untill I come and always remember me when Joseph was  murdered the piety of the people did not oppose his murder  when they arise will it be with white robes No but with garments  spotted with blood of the prophets. None on the Earth had sympa thy but the Saints. I have been spending a time to build up a   ENDENTRY stake in the wilderness. Why is it we have been driven  to these vallies of the mountains is it not that we may be  sheltered when the Judgments of God come on Babylon  A man should not be so taken up with his farm as to Forget this work some will say I have done so much for this Church that I must now do sumthing for myself there is  now many in Jackson Co who are waiting for the Saints to  come there but they will not get the blessings those will  who have come to the Salt Lake valley this is the best way to Heaven. Some want to go to I want men to go with me who want to go to meeting and  get reproof and kiss the rod I had such men with me and we  done well. I bear testimony that God is with this people   W. Woodruff addressed the meeting and said he was much  interested and edifyed in the testimony which had been bourn  by the presidency and Twelve and those who had spoken President  Joseph Smith was a prophet  of God He was well qualifyed to bear testimony of him He  has been with him day and night in his public and private  councils he knows his life and he has followed close in  his footsteps He always loved him and had he have been in Nauvoo at the time of his arest he would have stove  the barn doors into kindling wood bwith his fist if he  could not have liberated him any other way. their  is sumthing interesting in the testimony of men the anci- ents were martered for the testimony which they held  which they bore of Jesus Christ so men in this day  are opposed for their testimony but I know Joseph Smith was a prophet of God so is Brigham Young the  mantle of Joseph rest upon him and he has power to lead this people and my soul is filled with Joy  when he stands here and speaks the word of the Lord and  brings forth the glorious things of the Kingdom of God   President Young said I read that when the wicked  rule the people mourn. Ask the world do the wicked rule  yes And they mourn do they seek a righteous man to  rule No if the curse has followed the rule of the wicked it  will follow but let them sleep on and take your rest but  we understand the Lord has rent the veil sent Angels to us and the gospel to preach to the poor the difference  between us and the world is they say but do not nor  believe not we say and both believe and do the world spend  thousands of Dollars to preach the gospel but do not  believe it when the Judgments of God rest upon the  wicked and they are cut off then will be the glory of Grapes after the vintage is done. let the righteous  reign and the righteous will rejoice in the House of Israel God  takes up the Isles as a little thing builds up and pulls down at  his pleasure and why are not the people willing He should  reign Because of their meanness some may ask do not good man reign. I will ask a question should an Angel  come to President Fillmore and tell him how to govern   ENDENTRY the Nation and he was to tell of it they would shut him  up in a mad house and if God was to reveal to him  truth concerning the people and he was to tell of it the people would kill him this is the situation of this government the best on Earth. But let the president  sware and take the name of God in vaine and curse God all its form and they would let him stay with them as Hail fellows well met and the Nations will be damned and go to Hell who killed Ill in connexion with  the Carthage Mob and the whole Government ofsustained it and they will be damned from the President to the least member I think no more of a King or President than of the meanest ^poorest^ begger the worst scoundrel would is the most popular man in the Nation this Nation is the first the gospel was sent unto she has  killed the prophets that God sent unto them and their doom  will be the Neithermost Hell   W Richards says we have had much testimony to day I will add a few words when Hiram Smith fell in Carthage Jail and exclaimed I am a dead man then Joseph Smith fell dead John Taylor fell wounded I carried him to another part of the Jail covered him up I walked out before the people and said that Joseph and Hiram Smith who lay before me slain were two of the best men that ever lived Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and Hiram a Patriarch two better men never lived two better men God never made. Joseph was a Prophet Brigham is as great a Prophet and he that believeth it may be saved and he that believeth it not will be damned.    ENDENTRY September 8, 1851 ~ Monday   Monday Morning 8th Judge Brochus requested the privilege of addressing the people it was granted him he arose and commenced his speach by testifying ^of^ his kind reception among this people He had been sick among them and been kindly treated the flyies had been brushed from his face by a Lady and he was thankful He  refered to the Judiciary requested the people to sustain it and professed to be vary sorry that he was going to leave it. He then refered to a report in circulation that he  came here for the Purpose of being returned a delegate to washington and other things that were reported against  him andc. He then took up the subject of his appointment and said that President Fillmore had appointed him  although he was a Democratt and said he should not have received his appointment had he not been a capable virt uous good man He then addressed the Ladies upon the subject of the Washington Monument wished them to procure a block of Marble and to present it to washington also wished them to donate for the building of the Monument talked much about the virtues of washington and his bat tles and good deeds. He spoke of the persecution of the Saints considered them badly treated, sent to Winter Quarters whare our Dead was buried and had a sprig of Myrtle plucked He carried it in his bosom it was now dryed up He showed   ENDENTRY it to the Congregation. Isn speaking to the Ladies said he hoped they would become a virtueous people he did not wish them to send the block of Marble unless they could do it in full fellowship  with each of the seperate states composing the United States He had red some things casting reflections upon the United  States Government concerning our persecutions but he would defend the government as long as he had an Tongue to speak or hand to lift and said the Government could not do any thing for us as they had no power but if we wanted redress of our wrongs apply to Illinois whare we had received our (this part of the speech stired the blood of the whole congrega- tion) much was said by the speaker which was calculated to stir the blood of the people and offend them He then closed   President Brochus was  either profoundly Ignorant or wilfully wicked  In presenting some sentiments which he had to the assembly this day and had he have supposed for a moment that he was going to throw out a challenge upon that stand in a religious Meeting and present such sentiments as he had he should not for a moment have given his consent to have had him spoken on that occasion. He said several stood by and wished to take up the challenge given by the Judge but he would not permit of it for some might get their hair pulled if not their throats cut. And he would not have it He wished the meeting to adjourn and meet in the afternoon and transact business in the capacity of a conference for which the meeting was called Meeting adjourned one hour   Met according to adjournment. After singing and prayer Brother Kempton addressed the meeting was followed By Broth Gifford. Br John Young next addressed the House and was followed by  H. C. Kimball who said I will tell one thing that will  have a great effect upon us will remove the mist when we  come to the House of the Lord Bring an offering to the Lord I wil make an Offering to the Lord and to the priesthood as Abram did to Melchezedic and offer the best you have. did this law come from Joseph who was ordained under the hands of Peter Brigham Young was ordained under the hands of Joseph to hold the keys of the Kingdom of God if you strike against him you strike against God who sent him The Judges came here to Judge criminals not to Judge us who keep the Law. He then sat down and we had a song from the welsh Brethren   President Young then arose and said I will speak of principle you may think it is a Novel conference How long has it been since we have had the privilege of spending a conference undeisturbed a long time I would like to hear Brother Kempton speak or any good man. I will preach Br Abbott funeral sermon and the funeral sermon of all the faithful His body is laid in the dust to rest untill the resurrection forever blessed is the man that lives and dies a Saint. I will tell whether the Messenger sent to Brother Kempton was of God or the Devil If the Messenger sent was of God he would know it, if the messenger was any whare els but here he must have come from Heaven or from   ENDENTRY another Hell for we are in Hell go to the world and preach the gospel you will find some people as honest and good as Angels as far as they know but do they have revelations from God and know the things of God No they do not. If Brother Kempton has had his sins  forgiven and remitted without baptism so could all men but this is false for no man could have forgiveness without the sheding of blood and baptism the Bible says unless you keep the commandments you cannot be saved when Br Kempton sayes he knows his sins were forgiven before he was baptized  he dont know what he sayes At times the spirit of God is given to men to see the kingdom of God and they think they are  in it when they have not entered the door of baptism dont go and call the different Denominations because their sins are not forgiven them that they are always going to dwell in Hell for if they aere honest they will have a glory greater than  many who carry the Gospel to men their is as good people among all sects Gentiles Jews and Heathen as their is on Earth they act according to the best light they have. what is the condem- nation of this Government, light has come into the world and men love darkness rather the light they reject that light fight the prop hets and shed their blood for this they are damned   Elder Joseph Brigham and all men what they were by the assistance of light and truth as far as we follow light and truth so far we shall appoxamate  towards light and truth and God if God and Angels were made what they are by truth as far as we learn that truth and follows out  the council of it so far he will be like God and when he leaves that truth he goes into darkness and misery. If the United States were practi- zing truth they would be vary different from what they now are the practice of right things make men rejoice the practice of Evil things make sorrow we are agents to do right or wrong if a man feels disposed to go to Hell he has a right to it is no mans business He goes on his own responsibility and agency so if he wishes to Go to Heaven he has a right to by keeping a Celestial law let me do my work to acceptance. we know many truths we cannot think off of. Adjourned untill 2 oclok   Met according to adjournment. The officers of the church were  presented to the assembly and accepted in the following order The Presidency, Twelve, President of the stake, Patriarch, High council, High Priest, Seventies, Bishops, Elders priests Teachers and Deacons Perpetual Emigrating Company, and Historian, Building Committee.   President Young sayes I want to esstablish some travelling Bishops a thing that we never have done. when I approach the subject of the Bishops I pause not with a trembling hand but I want to take time and look at it all day until we can see  clearer than we now do. this people still stick to the world  love the world, we should use the world and not worship it No man is free indeed untill he is free in Christ and above the world dont worship the world you will not be free Is their any one that has anything but what God gave him you cannot make one hair white or black. Now it is our duty to feed cloth and sustain the families of those who are in the vineyard preaching if we let them suffer and they die their blood will be required at our hands we as a people have never   ENDENTRY done it yet but it was time it was done. The Bishops are reproved they dont do their duty. John Banks was ordained Travelling Bishops. O Hyde were set apart to go to Kanesville and gather out all the Saints in that region of country Willard Snow and A. O. Smoot was appointed to Go to England. Venson Shirtliff on  a foreign mission Dr Donyan to preach in the Eastern States Clayton then red an account of the Tithing. The Patriarch John Smith said I rejoice to have the privilege of speaking to you I have been in the work since  Jan 1832, and am about the oldest man here I was ordained  an Elder under the Hands of Joseph Wakefield. The Smith family was chosen to bring forth this work My team halled the first load of stone to build the kirtland temple my Son George A Drove the team. There was 4 Brothers us in the stand in Kirtland I am now left alone. I was in Jail with Hiram the night before they were killed, next day 3 guns were snaped at me I could not weep for a long time when I did weep I wept much. I have laboured much from  that untill this to keep things right. It is the little Foxes that spoil the vines we have a Prophet for a leader now pay your tithing and make good measure when you sell any thing, and fulfill all your covenants if made right we shall then prosper in this valley I am an old man and cannot say much but I will write a peace to be published in the paper   H. C. Kimball said I am going to make an offering to president Young Abram paid tithes to Melchezedeck. A certain woman gave a purse others filled it Br Rhodes gave the President sixty four pounds of gold for the public works He has not lacked anything you should give the best you have to the Lord and He will pour you out a blessing that there will not be room to receive it   Bishop Edward Hunter spoke said he was appointed the Chief Bishop was thankful for the confidence put in him. I want to bear my testimony of the things of God He spoke of his experience wanted to know his duty and was ready to do it.   W. W. Phelps spoke took for a text Pay your tithing   Brother Chase speaks, start right, keep right and then you will come out right He spoke well upon tithing   Z Pulsipher spoke and said I feel thankful to hear the aged Brethren speak and bear their testimony of the Prophet Joseph we have had many revelations let us improve upon them   B. Young said I will put the motion will the sisters vote to quit using tea and coffee, the Brethren have voted not to use tobaco I will speak of the Bishops I spoke of them  yesterday, and reproved them sharply some wanted them ^me^ to offer an apology to them I will not I will see them in Hell before I will do  it. If this people do not do better than the Bishops have they will and if you do not do better than you have done you will go to Hell I will begin with myself. I have taught the Bishops principle and  their duty Ask them if they can do it No I will cut the Bishops  off from the Church if they do not do better. did I ever council them wrong you have trampled my council under foot I shall not shrink from duty. I say to all old and young pray in your  learn to pray. Pray in your families. Be content in all circumstances   ENDENTRY whare the Lord shall place you. scease your contention one with  another Never go to law. gather your families together and  pray for me and my Brethren and yourselves untill a blessing rains upon  us.   Noah Packard spoke said many things said he wanted to  be a son of thunder.   E. D. Woolley addressed the meeting made many good remarks said we had a B. Young   B Young wished to say a few words to the Mormon Battalion those  who are wanting their extra pay are applying to William, Blair  and Babbit if you apply to these men and give them the papers and  they cheat you out of it dont complan, and I say to those  men not to take any papers from those who have had their  pay or sold their claims to others. If you want your pay apply  here, and you can get it. You did not enlist to get $8 pr month  they enlisted us to kill us and because we speak our sentimets  we are accused of treason I dont ask any odds of the U.S. I will  express my feelings to drive us from our Millions and possessions  than require us to fight their battles is not right.   I shall pay my tithing. The Twelve will pay one 10th of their possessions  and the Bishops and all will pay their tithing. This is the kingdom  of God and if it falls I am willing to fall with it. I had rather  fall than stand if the Priesthood falls. All covenanted  to pay their tithing one tenth of all they possess   Bishop Hunter spok upon the tithing would begin with himself  and wished all the Bishops to do the same   Lorenzo Young spoke upon the Tithing   President Youg said he wished all the people to pay their  tithing to the Bishops of their ward. He refered to the remarks  made by Father Smith on the word of wisdom. He said $50000  dollars had been spent in the valley during the past year for needless  things for Coffee tea Tobaco andc many others remaks were mad By president Youg "Elder Banks spoke upon the law of liberty President Youg followed in reply and said the liberty of the Holy Gospel  was peace and righteousness we had no liberty to take away another  mans rights but the first principle of liberty was resignation and  submission for go whare you will to Heaven or Hell you have to submit  to laws we are at liberty to adobt evry Holy principle to all Eternity go East North or South keep evry thing you want for  yourself wife children houses cattle and create out of the elements  evry thing you can yet you are not at liberty to infringe  upon the rights of men you may have the privilege to do all  things that is done in heaven. Organize the elements give commands  and rule over kingdoms but be subject to such laws as you  are under the law of liberty is to do right for God to all  Eternity the opposite principle is to be discontented with things  to be different from what they are this is Hell and all the Hell their  is I dont care how things are if I do right we shall find the law  of liberty to be Eternal life light and peace which will increase  to all Eternity we ought not to do an Evil to cause pain to any crea- ture, still their are some things that would appear to be evil I know  to be good to cut some mens heads off as it would be the ownly  way they could be saved. God will increase his kingdom to  all Eternity so shall we increase our kingdom to all Eternity   ENDENTRY Abraham seed will reign as kings of kings and Lords of  Lords and to his seed their is no end let this people live and do right and the blessings of God will atted you to all Eternity   Conferenc was adjourned untill the 6th Oct    ENDENTRY October 5, 1851 ~ Sunday   Sunday Oct 5th Elder O. Pratt addressed the assembly  and said I feel thankful to once more tread my feet in  the valley after being absent 4 years I feel thankful to behold  the faces of my brethren and friends and see the improvements  that have been made in my abscence. I could not tell whare  I was I was in danger of being lost without a guide I trust that while I have been absent on a mission to Great Britain I  have also been assisting to build up the kingdom of God and  when I left I believed it would continue to roll forth the work had taken such a deep root the powers of darkness could not break it up it seemed at times as though we should take the kingdom. The organization of the Churches  by the Twelve in that country was so perfect that notwithstanding  the great spread and increase of the work we can know monthly the state of the Churches increase andc throughout the  whole realm. The faith of the Saints in that land was increasing a great spirit of enquiry was manifesting itself in the High ranks of Society esspecially when they  hear of the rapid progress of the work and prosperity of this  people we are not hid up as some suppose. It is the general  Idea that we are destined to become a great people and a  Mighty Nation (is this treason) we are a strong people and  destined to be stronger untill our News reaches the utmost  parts of the Earth so that when the Mail comes the question  will be asked what News do you hear from that mighty  people in the Mountains as the emigration increases and ship  arive It will all increase the work and it will be as impossible to  hide it from the world as it would for the shining of the sun  to be hid and Zion will be terrible to the Nations of the Earth I feel as great a desire to help bear up the kingdom as a  man can I am willing to spend my life and all I have  to build up this kingdom I am willing to stay here or go  back tomorrow I presume this is the feelings of the Elders  here in this body their is Nothing so Joyful as to build up  the kingdom I would rather be abroad binding up the  grain than to break up my Farm if I had all the welth  of the Earth I would rather go without purse or scrip than to spend  the time to work for myself when I look at the magnitude of  this work I cannot feel otherwise with the spirit of God in my  heart I want to see the Seventies going forth and gathering from  all kingdoms and countries and from every Island of the Sea untill  all Israel is gatherd. I do not feel to say more to day but will sit down and hear from my Brethren, I wish to do my duty while here   G. A. Smith said it is with pleasure I behold the faces of O. Prat and others this is my Fathers House we have had good instruct ion from our Brother here I have spent my time to settel  other Colonies we cannot all settel down here we should  spend our lives to improve and prepare ourselves for immortal glory   ENDENTRY and exhaltation. I have exhorted my new comers to go down  to the south before they settel here and help to build up a stake  if you remember the words of God in the days of Joseph  says Ye are laying the foundation of a great work and ye  know it not. we are now preparing to have a state  soon, soon the Brethren will come by 10 100 1000 and 10000 We have at Parowan 80 men and boys we want to have  evry man who knows any thing about making Iron  go to Iron Co. and make Iron as long as we have to buy  evry thing and pay 3 prices for it we shall be poor I  would rather mak our own ware and ploughes than to be a slave  to Ill. I never dreamed that when I or any Elder had a mission to preach the Gospel or build up Zion to ask  to be dismissed or return home untill my work was  closed such an Idea Never enterd my brain. If the  Saints will scatter abroad and settle these far vallies we can  come up here and present our tithings and offering and come and wor ship as they did in Jerrusalem come and raise 1000 bushels  of wheat and potatoes and say to the Nations of the Earth come  and eat and do sumthing to build up Zion.    Afternoon President Young sayes we hear the Brethren arise and return thanks for the blessings received we can respond to it  the work is of all importance to the Human family the  Brethren are all willing to do right and they say Lord not  my will but thine be done. If the Lord should say come  and preach to us we would say Amen to it the Lord has his  means to carry on his work and also his own means to do it  when the peoples hearts are prepared to do the will of  God the victory is ours if we come to understanding so  as to have the organization of the kingdom of God so that  evryone acts in unison like a beautiful peace of machinery  when we gain the victory we shall then know how to order our  speech and conversation aright before God this is a good  people cannot we be better we have faith and knowledge cannot we have more of it yes their is an Eternity of it. we  have learned to obey by the things we suffer but what do we  behold their is evil surmising, speaking, and doing. the Evil intruder has not left us. who is keeping this commandment that loves  his Neighbor as he does himself will save his Neighbor  Garden and crops andc we shall then believe and practice all the commands we shall have one common interest I  dont care what you believe if you practice right and act  as though you love the Lord and then you will do right their  is no school like your own experience when I herd Geore  A. Smith speak I thought of former days when men  from Canida and other places would stop 50 miles this side of  Kirtland leave the money with the wife go and see Joseph  and say how I love you. But let Joseph ask him for a few dollars and they would instantly dodge at it while in  the world you would go away now you are here I canot  get you to go to the far vallies because warfare and carthage are not there I felt like crying abot Amasa company they  were ready to go to Hell. How ready the people are to go to Hell  let the Eyes of the saints be open I had to plead with   ENDENTRY I could not stay  them Now I want you to go and you wont go I want to have  you go to Iron Co. the people here are so full of wheat and good  things that they loath it. If you dont want to pay your  tithing the Lord dont want you tithing untill you go into Hell  if you dont want to save yourself nor your children  nor your dead dont pay your tithing if you do want to save  then pay your tithing for it is for your benefit not  mine you cannot do the Lord any good in it or add to  his glory but it is for yourself. The cattle have come  in well of late and I think the best has been sent in you should be industrious and saving, I dont want my children  to be lazy if I die I dont want any man to foster them in  idleness make your cloth yourself I wish my boys  had to work as I did for a living.    ENDENTRY October 6, 1851 ~ Monday   Monday Oct 6th Conference assembled according to  adjournment singing and Prayer by W W Phelps  President Young said the time had come to commence  the business of the semianual conference the business  of the last conference was productive of more good  than any conference we ever held. the keeping  of the word of wisdom has done much good I will be exceding glad when we arive at wisdom in all things  the word of wisdom was given in Kirtland 20 years  ago for the benefit of all Saints when we live 20 or 50 years longer we shall see that we do not  understand much of the word of wisdom we are  but babes in understanding wisdom who understands  it, was all spoken that might be spoken their is but one ysystem of explaining any Revelation and that is the Rev- elation of Jesus Christ in the heart of man when he  possesses the Holy Ghost we are forbidden to use meat in hot  weather. Hot drinks and tobaco is not good for man you should not eat to over load your stomach. their is a greater  lack in my system of wisdom of tempering my food and  exercise than in eating meat or tobaco. Tithing is com ing in so fast their will not be room to receive it  I wanted this conference to come together so I could  see their faces not to scold them I want to see their  faces they look better to me than all the Glories of  the Earth I said when the Brethren got out of  prision I wanted to sit and look at them three weeks Our  graineries and stour house are full of wheat and good things  If this people are rich beautiful and happy I am with them. If they are miserable I am still with them if this  people are not Crowned and saved none of us will be FIGURE it is in vain for one man to build himself up and  neglect his brothers interest He will fail in it. we  must begin to manifacture all we want or we are slaves  to every thing in all the Earth evry thing is against  Mormonism and Mormonism is against evry thing everything  is against us Hear it O Earth for the kingdom of God is  against all Earth and Hell this is true and we shall fight   ENDENTRY them untill the kingdom of this world become the kingdom of our God we shall fight battle after battle untill the victory is won we have to fight and lay down our  lives for Christ sake we now want to gather companies  to go to the different vallies. I want the potters to remain  here and work at their business. Jesus descended below all things before He ascended above all things we have got to sacrafice ever freely in order to be exhalted  before God. I once said I will go and build me a house on the hill out of the mud. Joseph said you will stay  whare you are this was enough I dodged as quick as I  could I said enough since I have been willing to be  Governed by circumstances that have surrounded me  and leave the event in the Hands of God   Judge valley in July last I expected to sit and hear and learn I have been a silent  observer of your temporal and spiritual matters. Your  Governor has laid a foundation for you to build upon  I consider it to be the province of this people to determine  for themselves what they most need I do not see that you will break any law of God in doing right and your  own will I like the remarks made that you be free  and not abject slaves make what you want and be free  buy all you want and be slaves. we say we look to gGod  and do his will. We are a little people upon a little patch  of the Earth but if we all pull together we shall become the Head. I did not run with the rest because I thought  it right to stay. If I thought it right to run I should  run, but it was right to stay so you must be right  the Lord said you must gain your bread by the sweat of the brow you must make your own leather or you  cannot get money enogh to buy it with so with  tea coffee and sugar you must raise and make it or go  without it you must make your own Iron or fail for Iron must be had. leathier and Iron must be maid and make your own clothing. I like your conferences and to hear the best men speak to communicate intel- ligence to others the church all draws one way and this  puzzles the world they all draw one way and have a  reason for it this I glory in I would not obey  if their was not a reason for it I would leave  Z Snow would not draw with you if he could not give a reason for it. I came here to deal out Justice  to all Jew and Gentile alike I came not to watch for iniquity but to punish iniquity when it does appear  I have had 200 cases in a year with the same No as you are I hope you will not have a case you will  never be destroyed unless you destroy yourselfves  if you do not war with yourselves I hope others will not war with you    B Young said at our conference we appointed Felt  and Banks to be travelling Bishops to visit other Bishops to call them to an account and see that they are   ENDENTRY Faithful Bishops and you should feed the poor and do your duty untill the spirit of God rest upon you and you hold  the keys of the Melechezedek priesthood of the Eternal God  and the power of it rest upon you forever Brother Felt were Ordained under the hands  of the Presidency.    Afternoon prayer by H. C. Kimball  says A Cordon is nominated to be a travelling Bishop carried  unanimously He was ordained under the hands of HCK John and G A Smith Heber C Kimball sealed upon his head all the keys of the priesthood said the power  of God should rest upon his head to preside over other Bishops. Another thing is necessary which will effect the whole world that is a reffermation chose  men who are filled with the Holy Ghost to go forth as  missionaries to stir up the feelings of the Saints in  all these vallies of the Mountains I thank God  that we are free D Fulmer and  Z Pulsipher was appointed as missionaries   G A Smith arose and said I feel perfectly at  home here I want to speak concerning Iron Co I  had but 20 or 30 with me there President Young wants John D Lee to get a company to go over the rim  of the Basin and form a settlement in a good place   for wine fruit and corn I asked some of Amasas  company what they were going to do they said they  were going to plant a vineyard if they had done  it there they would have done good you should go to Iron Co settle your families then go down  in the winter and build a fort the Indians there  are well supplyed with arrows on foot No arrows  or guns it is poorer than Iron Co it borders upon  the Great sahara desert I felt that we are free when I heard that Iron and coal was found in  abundance within 15 miles of each other in Iron Co. we  have not the Great Blast Furnises that are in the  world but must begin with the Native Element. He  also made other remarks   B Young made remarks concerning the education of our children  wished parents to pay particular attention to teaching their children  after which the conference closed it was one of the most  interesting conferences ever held by this people.    ENDENTRY October 9, 1851 ~ Thursday   Nov October 9th Sunday O Pratt addressed the assembly and  said he did not believe any man capable or qualifyed to  speak acceptable to God no matter what his abilities were unless he had the spirit of the Holy Ghost He would  not take any office on Earth if the office of the president  of the United States was offered him he would disdain it as far as the honor of it was concerned He would rather have the office of a teacher in this church as it would last   ENDENTRY forever while the office of president of the U.S would not last but 4 or 8 years I should be glad to live to see the  day when their should not be a Kingdom or government  on Earth ownly that ordained of God to govern the  world I do not know as I shall live to see it but I have much desired it for a man to desire to live merely to get honor to himself would not be right but for him to desire to live to honor God and build up his kingdom would be a good desire. If I knew I could be translated to all  the glory of the Celestial Kingdom in an instant I would rather live and suffer with my Brethren through all their troubles untill the coming of Christ I am sorry to see the old vetrans who have helped to lay the foundation of this church lay their bodies in the Grave I believe many will live those who have had it promised unto them if they remain faithful untill the coming of Christ and help build up the kingdom this has been promised to me by the patriarch and prophet while receiving my Endowment the hearts of men were inspired to give us these blessings while their hands were upon our heads. this always stim- ulates us to hold on by faith when death is around us and  slayes thousands upon our right and left hand it is an easy matter for God to strengthen a man in his Tabernacle in the midst of Death and plagues all around him He did the Ancients who lived to a great Age their Eyes were not dim their Ears were quick to hear but we all have weaknesses and much to contend with this is that we may increase and arive at Great Glory by  getting the mastery over the devil and much evil if we were  not tempted and tryed and overcome we should not get the glory that we otherwise shall. How could God trust a man  who would be overcome by temptation it would take him a long time to get confidence in him again Jesus was a fair sample subject as He was to temptation in all things He overcame so can we and follow in the steps of our Elder  Brother Better to do this than to Enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season then die as the fool dieth if a man had power given him and had not discretion given him to use it he would ruin himself this is the reason why this people 20 years old has not power greater power they have not wisdom to use it we have the gifts of the Gospel to heal the sick to speak with New tongues, to cause the blind to see lame to walk deaf to hear, and cast out devels and with these gifts some  have been so lifted up taken honor and glory unto themselves they have fallen. I thank God for sparing his gifts any further than they prove beneficial to us if God gave us all things at once it would kill us but if we were proven in all things then we could endure all things (things are freq- uently given of the Lord that men cannot all endure they are more than they have wisdom to manage when this is the case they cannot advance untill they master what has been given let this be remembered and not ask for more after what we can manage for if we ask the Lord for a Revelati- on and He gives us a New commandment we are under the greater respon- sibility for we have to keep all the commandments of God   ENDENTRY if commandments are given us and we dont obey then our light becomes darkness then how great is that darkness it would be better for him not to have the light at all If the Lord had given all men all they have asked for they would many of them been out of the Church now I have herd many say I have Asked the Lord to reveal certain principls unto me and He did not do it but this is because it was not wisdom to give it unto you but if you are faithful the day will come when God will give any man what he asks for if he asks for it in righteousness. I believe the  Lord loves this people and is preparing us to recieve all good  things the day will come when the Lamanites will build a city called the New Jerrusalem. They not we build it we with all the Gentiles who repent will help build it the powers of Heaven will be revealed and Jesus be in our midst and the power of Heaven be revealed by Adam  and all men will hear it in the kingdom of God and all secrets and key words of the priesthood and all things will be revealed I hope you will harken to council and do all things which  God Requires of us in the name of Jesus Christ Amen    ENDENTRY October 12, 1851 ~ Sunday   Sunday 12th S M Blair spoke to the people and gave a good exhortation   Brother Simeon Carter followed the same day spoke of the deeds  of the prophet He knew the Twelve had to lead, had no desire to follow any body els. He was followed By Brother Major    ENDENTRY October 19, 1851 ~ Sunday   Sunday 20th 19th Oct Elder O Pratt spoke upon the death of Sister Hendricks. He was thankful we as a people were settelled in these vallies of the Mountains whare it was healthy we have here to fore suffered much by sickness in other places but we cannot get entirely away from sickness and death let us go whare we will in this life for all men must taste of death even those who  were translated had to have a change to Immortality their may be some pain attending that even if it  was ownly for an instant. Their must be some space between death and the resurrection sin is the cause of this evil even death without sin men would have been Immortal. If I should hear of a God who had made  man to have pain and sorrow without any agency or sin I could not have any confidence in him, and the Heavens could not it may be said it is necessary to have sorrow and misery in order to Enjoy good the Lord when He made the world knew how to fix things so that man should bring upon himself death evil and sorrow if he had agency He planted  the tree of knowledge of good Evil in the midst of the garden little children did not commit sin but their parents did it was not our own sins that brought death but the sin of our first parents death being introduced into the world we all partake of it if we had not the great plan of salvation revealed we should be without law if it was not for revelation we should not know that we had an Immortal spirit within us we should take   ENDENTRY care of the spirit as well as our bodies the spirit needs taking care of as well as the body the spirit is a being that  possesses certain capacities that are as Eternal as  God himself that were never given to it I do not believe  that any matter that ever saw the time that it could not love hate fear andc can ever do it again but I believe it is Eternal the formation may not be Eternal but the substance of which it is composed is Eternal the capacities may be enlarged but its capacity always exhisted their may be a time when our spirits had a begining of formation but the capacity always exhisted the Infant at first appeared as a blank page but  that spirit before it came here was full of knowledge as was the case with the Babe of Bethlehem Jesus Christ He had wisdom  to construct worlds before He came here but had now descended below all things came from His Fathers throne but his knowledge power and wisdom was laid aside and nothing but the bare capacity was left can any man remember the first month of his life in the flesh No Neither can you remember the time of your exhistance or doings before you came here this is to prove men if they will prove faithful while this know ledge is taken from them in infancy childhood and manhood  life and Death if one man Jesus Christ can ascend and  overcome all things so can another. If we find anything that is good lovely, virtueous, good, exhalted then let  us lay hold of it untill we are exhaulted then the spirit  will adorn the body and do away with many of the Evils of the fall their is sumthing in the countenance of a man who takes care of his spirit that is glorious and good the Lord made the spirit of man according to the plan devised in his wisdom but this was made of  Eternal substance of many beings composed in orse  in ourselves brought together into one and Gems given to our spirits then let us take care of our spirits. many thing may be said about the object of our bodies and spirits they are destined to arise in glory Exhaltation And Eternal  life then let us take care of our bodies and spirits we have our minds filled with the cares of life and yet when  we die we have to leave all our temporal affairs it  seems to be the object of God that we should earn  our bread by the sweat of the brow if this was not the case we might be Idle which would produce more evil than it would to labour if we improve our time we shall get glory that we should not get if we were Idle for when we die the knowledge we have gained will be of benefit to us we cannot get a fulness of Glory while our spirit and body is seperated we may think reflect and know right from wrong but we cannot act as in the body we  shall look for the resurrection of the body with much interest and great anxiety if it was not for the resurrection of the body we should be subject to the devil and death temporal and spiritual those who kept the celestial law will be redeemed from all sin and death restored to God and all blessings their is for man such will have Joy in paradice. Joseph says if we keep the law we shall   ENDENTRY we shall have a celestial paradice and our spirits return and hunt up our bodies and enter it again with a fulness of celestial spirit. How will the Resurrection be brought to pass and when will be the different times of the resurrection the good ^{and bad}^ will arise before those who die after the Resurrection of Christ the good did arise at the Resurrection of Christ we find mummies in the catacombs of Egypt who died long before christ arose who remain yet some saints in Asia and America did arise and appear unto many. I do not  believe the resurrection will take place by being born again as the doctrin of some is I would not believe it for the world unless President Young was to say the Lord had revealed  it to him I believe the Saints will arise out of their  graves ##Ezekiel 34:12## as Ezekiel said they would. The Resurrection will take place before the son of Man comes as the scriptures declair. Before He comes their shall be a great sign appear in Heaven all the Nations of the Earth shall see it together An Angel shall sound his trump that all Nations will  hear it saying that Babylon will be burned then after half an hour of silence the veil of the covering will be taken off the face of Heaven will be revealed and the  face of the Lord will be unveiled and the graves of the Saints will be open and the Saints on the Earth will be caught  up to meet the Lord this is the first Resurrection the Zion of Enoch will also appear and dwell on the Earth the Saints will then receive their Everlasting inher itances Joseph got a promise from the Lord that he should have a right to an inheritance in the Nauvoo  House forever. if the Saints do not get their possessions  by covenant as Joseph Nauvoo their will be Judges appointed to give evry  man his inheritances for an Everlasting inheritance then comes the time when Joseph and all will receive their keys and turn them to the saints in this dispensation and reveal the mysteries of Eternity to the Saints who have their celestial bodies they will be qualifyed to receive a fulness of celestial glory and spirit and will receive all they can Endure but they will grow to all Eternity in knowledge and power will the Saints be confined to this Earth No they will be caught up  and not die and lie in the dust Jesus will have a Throne in Jerrusalem and the Saints will have thrones on the Earth but they will go to other worlds or in the Heavens and all will be free Adam will give instructions concerning the garden of Eden we will go on foreign missions to visit other worlds we shall also remember our works in this life and inasmuch as they have been good it will be a consolation to reflect upon them   I Baptized Sister Foss and family and my own family and confirmed them 9 in all.   Rhoda Foss was Married on the eve of Nov 30th 1851   ENDENTRY President Youngs medical lecture deliverd before the board of Health at Great Salt Lake City Dec 1851   President Young arose and said I wish to impart intelli- gence to the people my first proposition is the science of medicine. The study and practice of medicine as a science if it  may be called a science is the most imperfect of any science  in existance as is practiced by the doctors of the present day The doctors and priests of the day send more to death and Hell then any whare els. about one in a million may get some glory A bigger set of cursed scoundrels never graced the Earth than that class. surgery is a different class and is vary necessary in  many instances and that system can be learned. But to learn the  system of man they cannot no more learn that than they  can learn the Heavens. A worst set of Ignoramuses do not walk the Earth. they do not know how to turn {the illegible} wind in a mans body when it gets cross ways. If you cut their infernal throats  the people will live I know what this society is here for it is to impart what knowledge they have to others. But I have seen the folly of the  doctors even at my own doors. take them as a whole they are  the most damnable set on the Earth their practices are infamous  and their medicines produce death; If the people want to Eat Calomel let them do it and be damned but dont feed it to any of my family if any doctor does and I know it I would kill him as quick as I would for feeding Arsnic. I do not  employ such doctors to visit me. I dont Employ any doctor to visit me. The practice of Doctors in visiting women in child birth is damnable woman should be let alone and let Nature have its part at work let a woman keep her child if she can 2 or 3 years but she cannot do it when the time has come Nat- ure will deliver her of her child without a Doctor dont fret let evry thing take its proper course and sickness would  depart away. The Doctors in New Haven Ct by mutual  agreement to see how far they could frighten a man did actually frighten him to death a robust harty man. many  things should be said to this people. their has not been a Doctor baptized into this church that has the Holy Ghost but what will acknowledge they are a fool. their is not a Physician in the church or in the world that is taught from on high by revelation but what will acknowledge  this to be true doctrin if their is a doctor who can see and  know a man from head to foot and know how to cure his  deseases by revelation such are the ownly true and safe  Doctors on Earth all others are fools I see men die in the hands of the doctors. the medicines kill them. why  dont they tell what ales the patient or acknowledges  they dont know.   The foolery their is among this class  is disgraceful and makes me mad and the day will come when you will not wonder at my feelings you are natural persons and God has made you natural if you are with child that child will come forth by nature without a Dr the Earth is just so will bring forth of itself seed after its kind. If a person is sick and have not faith to be healed give them herbs the product  of the Earth and it will cure you until it is time to die   ENDENTRY when a cat is sick she will eat catnip without a  doctor and she gets well Nature promps her to it if a dog is bit with a rattlesnake he will dig a hole in the Earth  and lie in the ground untill the poison is gone out so  Nature will teach us as well as the cat and dog when a toad  is bit by a spider it will go and eat plantain if he can get it. If a child is to die in being born let it die but dont  employ a Dr to kill it. How will you be instructed I will  tell you what to do if you are taken sick dont be frightened  but be calme. if you get a cold let Nature be jo disease will go up and down through the system to find a place to be located it is as much our duty to know how to  cure our system as to feed our body the Doctors would  say you are deseased and dont know it who made the Doctors the  Devil. The Lord did not make the Doctors of the present day such a thing as a man midwife was not known untill  about 1500 why did not the women all die before this time look at the Indians for 100 years millions of children have been born in the wilderness of male and female and they live and not die without a doctor. You may ask what shall we do I will tell you I will give you a lessen and I want you to remark  it when you go to visit a woman in travail let her alone  untill her full time has come remember it let the mother alone let your system be natural teach them also to exercise all that they can that when they come to be deliverd it will be better for them. A doctor if he had good sens would not wish to visit women in child birth, and if a woman had good sense she would not wish a man to doctor them  on such an occasion I want you to teach your children  the principle of truth I talk as I do for the people will not sens any thing unless they are half knocked down or  thunder rolls in their Eaers soft words will not do I  want you to hear and understad their has been some difficulty in this Board of Health. If I had been with you you would not  had had any difficulty. It has been through a misunderstanding if you understand principle you would not quarrel you may spread calomel on your bread and butter and eat it if  you wish but it is deadly poison as Arsenic but not as quick it is not good you may ask if it was ever good in any case there may be cases whare it might be a  benefit but it would want a revelation to tell whare  it was. Their is not poison in lobelia I will give $5000 dollars for the 16 part of an oz of poison that  can be extracted out of all the lobelia in this valley. it is not probable that any two persons are organized just alike in all respects. Then who is a Physician Now unless he be taught of God and is a prophet or revelator he cannot  understand the Human System know desease and what will cure it I dont care how a man acts if he intends to act right and when they act wrong are willing to be righted. we will take the Best physician of the day that lives the closest to the Lord I dont care how will he is he will be brought down as a fool for he will be made to let God be honored.  I have been on a Journey in  the dust I have got dust on my brain that is what ales me   ENDENTRY It will wash off could a doctor tell what ales me No can a doctor tell what ales a sick man by feeling of  his pulse No more than he could by feeling of a dogs  tail. Their is no Physician except he is taught of God you should learn how to doctor yourselves you should study your own system, any people who must trust to a doctor at all times will die but trust in God and you will live longer what a diferent time it would be if all trusted in God  rather than in the doctors for 9 out of 10 die under the doctors care who would live if they trusted in God alone dont get freightened and you will do well enough it is Just as reasonable to send for a doctor to have a calf, colt or pig brought forth as it was for a child.   After you receive your reserrected bodies you will bring  forth spirits to all Eternity who will go to some world and take  a tabernacle or body the same as we have you dont want a  doctor any more here than there if the members of this  society are true either male or female they will inpart all  useful knowledge they have to others if they are not willing to do this they are corrupt if one man knows more than another  let him tell his knowledge and if a man knows more than all the rest let him be a Father unto the people and teach them and not act like a boy, if I hold myself Equal I am  Equal if I am soperior let me manifest it by doing a  better deed and being superior myself. It is the man that rejects  light and knowledge when shown him that God condemns and I  condemn him some say we have spiritual wives but I think God has made us all natural and I think we should be  Natural.   We received several lectures from Judge Zerubabel Snow  concerning law our Legislative Enactments and various other  subjects. He commenced with the constitution of the United  States said the several states sent delegates and formed a  general convention and there after deliberating upon the situation they agreed to form a constitution and to cede up  a portion of their state rights for the purpose of forming a  general government constitution and congress of the United States and all the power that was not ceded up still  remains with the people and it was his opinion that we as a people had a right to make such laws as suited our own convenience Notions and circumstances, as long as it did not conflict with the constitution of the united of the their were rights belonging to all civilized men  which no power had a lawful right to take from them and he advised us to make such laws as we wished without any regard to the common law of Englan or the laws which any of the states had adopted as long as we did not interfere  with any of the constitution of the United States. He dwelt lengthy upon the criminal code which we should adopt that criminal law was considerd more for the suppression of  crime than for the punishment of the guilty   I ordained 8 High priest and 7 members of the quorums of seventies at different Councils at the Council House not befor recorded   ENDENTRY FIGURE I Travled with the Presidency and  others to Parowan Iron County and explored the  country from Great Salt Lake there whole  distance travled 764 miles   I attended public meetings 28 meetings   I Preached 14 discourses   I Baptized 9 Persons   I Confirmed 9 Persons   I Ordained High council 12 High council   I Ordained High Priest 10 High Priest   I Ordained to the Seventies 8 Seventies   I Blessed Children 8 Children   I administered to sick persons 12 sick   I Married 2 persons   I Met with the Regency 8 times   I spent with the Legislature of Utah 12 days   I met with the perpetual Emigrating Co 4 times   I met with the Presidecy and Twelve 25 Councils   I wrote 10 Letters   I Received 8 Letters   I was appointed Chaplain of the Nauvoo Legion   ENDENTRY FIGURE WILFORD WOODRUFFS JOURNAL FOR 1852   ENDENTRY Eighteen hundred and fifty two has commenced each year is big with events to Both Zion and Babylon to the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world. what this year will bring to pass time alone can determin but great deeds and scenes are crouding to the birth we may look for great revolutions to commence in the old world for confusion and disunion in the States, and for some opposition against the Saints to be manifest but the Lord will govern the  helm of the States and Nations for the final good of the world  and to his honor and glory and for the benefit of the Saints    ENDENTRY January 1, 1852 ~ Thursday   Jan 1st 1852 I spent the day as a day of Thanksgiving according to the proclamation of the Govornor    ENDENTRY January 5, 1852 ~ Monday   Jan 5th Monday The legislature of the Territory of Utah met  according to the appointment of the Govornor I met with them    ENDENTRY January 6, 1852 ~ Tuesday   6th House met and received the Govornors Message    ENDENTRY January 7, 1852 ~ Wednesday to  ENDENTRY January 9, 1852 ~ Friday   7th 8, 9th I spent the time in the Legislature attended to the business of the same    ENDENTRY January 10, 1852 ~ Saturday   10th and 11 I spent the time in the Legislature    ENDENTRY January 11, 1852 ~ Sunday   11th spent the time in meeting    ENDENTRY January 12, 1852 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY January 17, 1852 ~ Saturday   12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 I spent the week in the Legislature    ENDENTRY January 19, 1852 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY January 24, 1852 ~ Saturday   19 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, I spent this week in the Legislature    ENDENTRY January 26, 1852 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY January 31, 1852 ~ Saturday   26, 27, 28, 29 30, 31 I spent this week in the Legislature    ENDENTRY February 2, 1852 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY February 5, 1852 ~ Thursday   Feb 2, 3, 4, 5 I spent this week in the Legislature.
