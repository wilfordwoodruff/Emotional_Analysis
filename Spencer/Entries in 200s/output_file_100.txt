He remarked  "some say the kingdom of God was not set  up on earth untill the day of pentecost &amp; that  John did not preach the baptism of repen tance for the remission of sins. But I say in  the name of the Lord that the kingdom  of God was set upon earth from the days  of Adam to the present time whenever  there has been a righteous man on earth unto  whom God revealed his word &amp; gave power  &amp; authority to administer in his name:  And whare theire is a Priest of God, A minister  who has power &amp; Authority from God to  administer in the ordinances of the Gospel  &amp; officiate in the Priesthood of God, theire  is the kingdom of God &amp; in consequence  of rejecting the gospel of Jesus Christ &amp; the  Prophets whom God hath sent, the judgm- ents of God hath rested upon people, cities &amp; nations in various ages of the world, which  was the case with the cities of Sodom &amp; gomo- roah who were destroyed for rejecting the  Prophets. Now I will give my testimony I care not for man I speak boldly &amp; faith- fully &amp; with authority. How is it with the  kingdom of God, whare did the kingdom  of God begin, whare their is no kingdom  of God their is no salvation. What consti- tutes the kingdom of God    ENDENTRY  teous man unto whom God gives his oracles  there is the kingdom of God, &amp; whare the oracles of God are not there the kingdom  of God is not. In these remarks I have  no allusion to the kingdoms of the earth, we  will keep the Laws of the Land, we do not  speak against them, we never have, &amp; we  can hardly make mention of the State  of Missouri of our persecutions there &amp;c  but what the cry goes forth that we are  guilty of larceny, Burglary, arson treason &amp; murder &amp;c &amp;c which is fals, we speak of  the kingdom of God on the earth not the  kingdoms of mem. The plea of many in  this day is that we have no right to receive  revelations. But if we do not get revelations  we do not have the oracles of God &amp; if they  have not the oracles of God they are not the people of God. But say you what will  become of the world or the various professors  of religion who do not believe in revelation &amp; the oracles of God as continued to his  Church in all ages of the world when he  has a people on earth. I Tell you in the  name of Jesus Christ they will be damned  &amp; when you get into the eternal  world you will find it to be so they cannot  escape the damnation of hell    preached I would say that John came preach- ing the gospel for the remission of sins he  had his authority from God &amp; the oricles  of God were with him &amp; the kingdom of God   ENDENTRY  alone. The Lord promised Zecheriah that he  should have a son, which was a desendant  of Aaron &amp; the Lord promised that the  priesthood should continue with Aaron &amp; his  seed throughout their generations.

An  angel of God Also appeared unto Zecheriah  while in the Temple and said that he should have a  son whose name should be John &amp; he should  be filled with the Holy Ghost. Zechariah was  a priest of God &amp; officiating in the Temple &amp; John was a priest after his father &amp; held the keys of the aronic priesthood &amp; was called of God  to preache the Gospel &amp; the kingdom of God &amp; the Jews as a nation having departed  from the Law of God &amp; the gospel the Lord  prepared the way for transfering it to the gentiles But says one the kingdom of God could  not be set up in the days of John for John  said the Kingdom was at hand.

I will proclaim in publick &amp; in private  that the sisters bought the glass &amp; nails by penny  subscription. Chuse ye this day wholm ye will  serve. We shall call upon this vast multitude  for a donation to buy powder &amp; fuse rope. We  want the brethren to do as much as the sisters.  We do not intend to finish the Nauvoo House  this season but to finish the Temple this summer  or the walls of it &amp; get the roof on by December  &amp; do of the inside next winter &amp; about a year  from this spring we will dedicate it we can  do any thing we undertake we have power &amp; we  can do great things. In 5 years to come the work  will progress more than it has for 10 years past  Isaiah said we should perform a marvelous work  and a wonder. I dont wonder he said so if he  saw this vast multitude &amp; I think this people is  abundantly able to build this temple &amp; much depends  upon it our endowments &amp; sealing powers &amp; many  blessings depend upon it. The Prophet arived &amp;  took the stand and arose in the midst of the  said (Orson Pratt come &amp; take your post) &amp; further  remarked I do not know whether the object  of the meeting has been told or not I apologize for not  comeing sooner. I have had so much on my mind  since I saw you that I hardly know whare to  begin or to say but one of the grand objects that  I had in view in calling this meeting was in making  a few remarks relative to the laws &amp; ordinances  and building the temple, the reason I want to  speak of the laws is the officers have difficulty  in administering the laws. We are republican &amp;  wish to have the people rule but rule in righteousness   ENDENTRY  would do, the laws are enacted by petition and  they can all be repealed if they wish it but the  people ought not to complain of the officers but  to complain of the law makers. I am instructed  by the city council to tell this people that if you do  not like any law we have passed we will repeal it  for we are your servants. Any that complain of  our rights and charters it is because they are  wicked the devil is in them. the reason I called  it up is we have a simple gang of fellows who  does not know whare their elbows or head is if  you preach virtue to them they will oppose that if  you preach Methodist God to them they will oppose  that or any thing els &amp; if their is any case tried  they want it appealed to Carthage. Mr Boswicks case  had to go to Carthage our Lawyers will send any  thing to Carthage. I want to know if the citizens  will sustain me when my hands are raised to heaven  for the people. I will areign the person before the  people that act against the interest of the city &amp;  I will have the voice of the people which is republican  and as likely to be the voice of God. And as long  long as long the iniquity of the Lawyiers and wicked men  I fear not their boiling over  nor the boiling over of Hell their thunders &amp; forked  lightning. I despise the man that will betray you with  a kiss. Here is Hiram Kimball has set at naught the ordinances of the city. By saying that He owns  the wharf &amp; steem boats need not pay them.  wharefore this body is the highest court what appeal  to Carthage I would not appeal there if i died a  thousand deaths. Kimball nor Morrison does not  own the wharfage Water Street runs along the   ENDENTRY  I will reprove the lawyers &amp; docters any how Jesus did &amp; evry prophet has &amp; if I am a prophet I shall do it, at any rate I shall do it for i profess to be a prophet. The laws &amp; constitution of the United States has ended up the right to corperate cities to regulate all wharfage of shiping &amp; steem boats &amp;c all laws of taxation is subject to the city &amp; not individuals. And I want from this time forth evry fool to stay at home &amp; let the steem boats &amp; captain alone and let the peace officers alone. How can we keep off mobs &amp; keeping innocent blood from being shed, by striking a blow at evry thing that rises up in disorder &amp; I will war an eternal war with those that oppose me while I am labouring in behalf of the city. A man has been writing to the New York Tribune. I will not mention his name. He says that much has been appropriated for the building the Temple that has been spent for other purposes. But I pledge myself that any man that has paid any old shoes, harnesses, horses, or any thing els if he will come I will show him on book that evry farthing has gone on book &amp; been appropriated for the building of the Temple  my head for a foot ball that this is true their are men in our midst who are trying to build up themse lves at our expense &amp; others in our midst that are watching for iniquity &amp; will make a man an offender for a word. But I will rest myself &amp; give way for others. President Hyram Smith arose and made some singular remarks quite romantic compared the lawyiers to polewags &amp; wiglers &amp; toads. He said they would dry up next fall these characters he thought was made in gigard making time when it was cheaper then in soul making time   ENDENTRY  &amp; the mayor fined him $10. President Joseph Smiths views of the goverment was then read, which was recieved with universal applause Gen Smith is now nominated by the saints as a candidate for President of the U.S.A. next election. An article was also read headed a voice of innocence from Nauvoo, and a meeting of the female relief society was appointed to attend to the above. writing meeting adjourned 1 1/2 hours. During intermission the Twelve met with the seventies &amp; they passed a resolution to build the hall of the seventies one story higher for the Presidency    singing &amp; prayer by O. Pratt sing a hymn. President B Young arose and addressed the assembly relative to different subjects as men have been spoken of in their capacity. I wish to speak of the duty of the claass of lawyiers classing myself with the lawyers in the house of Israel and when any man who is a Lawyer will take a course to break peace instead of making it is out of the way of his duty any doctor of the Law should read the law and make peac. The grand object we have before us is to build the Temple this season. We have herd the effects of slander &amp; we want a cure &amp; balm &amp; I carry one with me all the while &amp; I want all to do the same &amp; I will tell you what it is. it is to mind our own business &amp; let others alone and suffer wrong rather than to do wrong if any one takes your property away let them alone have nothing to do with them.

Did the people  or God. God &amp; not the people called him, had the  people gatherd together &amp; appointed one of their  number to be a Prophet he would have been  accountable to the people but inasmuch as he  was called of God &amp; not the people he is accountable  to God &amp; the Angel that committed the Gospel  to him &amp; not to any man on earth.

Elder G. A. Smith opened the  meeting by prayer Elder W.

Pratt who  reasoned soundly upon the prophesyes    was addressed by Elder H. C. Kimball who gave  some of his experiance &amp; bore testimony to the  work of the Lord much to our edifycation He was followed by Elder B Young who  also bore testimony to the work of the Lord  and among the many remarks he made he  argued in the following manner. Why do the people  oppose the gifts &amp; graces. If a man can get faith  by the power of God &amp; the gift of the Holy Gost so as to  lay hands upon his wife &amp; children or friends  when they lie sick &amp; languishing nigh unto death  &amp; command the fever, or disease, or the power  of the destroyer, or even death itself to depart to  cease its work, to be still &amp; the person is relieved  I ask what harm is their in all this, or if a man  by faith &amp; humility before God can get the  testimony of Jesus Christ &amp; prophecy of things to  come or speak in tongues or cast out devils, I  ask what harm in all this, does it do any harm  No it does not. I know the New Testament  is true for I have proved it according to the  pattern given by believing in Christ obeying   ENDENTRY  then I ask does these things harm any one, No  they do not. In speaking of the kingdom of  God, he said the kingdom must be together  the people must be together &amp; gatherd into  one place. For how would the king of france  or England look undertaking to reign over a  kingdom when the people were scatterd all  over the world except in france or England  they could not reign over a people unless a people  were with those kings to reign over, so with the  saints they must be gatherd together &amp; this work has  already commenced, &amp; who is the Author of this  work &amp; gathering, Joseph God as an instrument in the hands of God is the  Author of it, he is the greatest man on earth No other man of this age has power to  assemble such a great people from all the Nations  of the earth with all their varied dispositions  as assimulate them &amp; cement them together  so that they will be subject to rule &amp; order this the Prophet is doing &amp; what makes a  great king President or man is to have a  great People to rule over.    interesting time through the day.

We dined at  Br Harts during intermission we lade hands upon  Br Malin the Presiding Elder &amp; several other Elders In the afternoon the congregation again assembled  &amp; was addressed by Elder O Pratt he spoke in  much of the power &amp; demonstration of the spirit of  God from Rev 22  there shall be no more curse He commenced with the  fall the curse that came on the earth &amp; continued the  subject untill the end &amp; every curse was taken off traced  the subject through the Millinnium second advent of  Christ, the binding of Satan, peace for one thousand  years the numerous increase of the inhabitants of the  earth, &amp; the letting loose of Satan, his going up with  the hosts of the earth that he had deceived &amp; compassing  the Camp of the Saints &amp; the Beloved City &amp; fire came  down from Heaven &amp; devoured them. A great white  throne appeared, the Saints &amp; cities were cought up  to God, the Heavens &amp; earth passed away &amp; the Lord  made a new heavens &amp; new earth the Saints cities &amp;  new Jerrusalem &amp;c came down from God out of  heaven &amp; rested upon the new earth &amp; the last enemy  destroyed was death then Jesus Christ deliverd it up  to his father as pure &amp;c   ENDENTRY  wisdom and intelligence which the Prophet seer &amp;  revelator would have brought to light that would have been used for the benefit of the nations,  But now their die is cast and doom is sealed, &amp;  their judgment will come in an hour they are not  aware of. It was so with the Jews, they said if  we let Jesus alone he will come and take away  our state and Nation so they crusifyed his  shed his blood and said let it be upon us and our  Children. And the judgments came upon them their city was laid in the dust, &amp; the inhabitants fell by the sword &amp; famine and the remnant was  scattered throughout the gentile world, while if  they had recieved Jesus Christ he would oft  had gatherd together the people &amp; saved the city.  When the nations of the earth send their messeng ers or ministers to any people &amp; they are not recieved but   that nation take vengance on their enemies is God then of less consequence than man, when he sends  his Prophets, messengers &amp; servants to the world with  a message &amp; the people cast them out stone shoot  and kill them, will not God take vengance on that nation yea he ever did and ever will, and this nation will not escape. John said in pouring out the plagues upon the earth 16  the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and  evry living soul died in the sea, and the third angel  poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountain of  waters and they became blood. And the Angel said  the Lord was righteous in so doing for they have shed  the blood of Saints and Prophets and thou hast given them  blood to drink for they are worthy 6  was in the days of Jesus Christ, But it was not in the  days of Jesus Christ for John lived after and saw  things in the last days. It seems that the waters  was turned to blood because they had shed the   ENDENTRY  two Prophets in Jerrusalem slain, for they tormented  them. Prophets are always a torment to the People for they tell them the truth, reprove their transgressions speak of the Judgments that are to come, when those  prophets were to be slain the people all would rejoice  &amp; send Presents to one another because the prophets who  had tormented them were slain, but in three days  they stood upon their feet &amp; the Joy of their enemies  was of short duration. It is so now their is a secret  Joy in the hearts of the Priest and many people  that the Prophet and Patriarch is murdered and  some manifest their joy openly. It is always a  dark time Just before day, it is a dark time now but it will soon be light. When Christ was crucifyed  it was a dark time they were ready to go to their farm  fishing and merchandize and Peter sent to inquire if  he was the one or if we should look for another, the  answer was go and tell them what you see and  hear, feel my body I have arisen and Joy immediatly  arose in their bosom. As soon as the Jews found he  had arisin they bribed the guard to say that while they  were  is believed among the Jews untill the present day and they are taken in their own snare for it has been  that vary key that has chained them untill the present  time, &amp; so it is with this nation they have sealed their  damnation by shedding the blood of the vary man that  holds the keys of this last dispensation and consequently  their destiny. A word about Br Joseph being killed some have thought he could not be killed, but the Lord  never said so neither did Joseph say so. So did  Peter say to Jesus when he told him that he would be slain  or offered, far be it from thee this shall not come upon  thee Jesus said get thee behind me Satan thou savoreth not  the things that be of God but of men.   ENDENTRY  to Iowa &amp; while there he inquired of the Lord what he   should do and the Lord told him to return and give  himself up he appeared to be aware that he would be slain. The covenants convey this ^same^ idea ^concerning Joseph^ see Page 159 4 par Behold I grant unto you eternal life if you should be slain Page 126, 1 &amp; 2 Par. It is supposed by some that the Govornor  had a hand in this affair, at first they were not ready to  recieve him for the plan was not finished how to dispose  of him. The Govornor had taken away all of the state  arms, &amp; was in Nauvoo requesting them to give up  their private arms at the same time that they were murder- ing our brethren at Carthage Jeal. as soon as the word came  the govornor fled, the women and children removed so as to  place but this failed. In consequence of the death  of the prophets the Editors seem to get the spirit of prophecy and say the work is done &amp; will stop, and die. But as I  am in the midst of the Prophetic Editors like Saul I  ketch some of the spirit of Prophecy &amp; so I will prophesy  that instead of the work diying it will be like the mustard  stock that was ripe that a man undertook to throw out  of his garding and scattered seed all over it and next  year it was nothing but mustard. It will be so by  shedding the blood of the prophets it will make 10 Saints  whare their is one now. Some said that he would  be President, but is now dead, now what will he do the Revelator says He that overcometh will I give  Power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a  rod of Iron. I dont know but he may hold the keys  of the Plagues that are to be poured out in the last  days upon this and other nations. Angels appeared  anciently to John, who were his fellow servants the prophets Joseph may appear in this day to his brethren This gospel of the kingdom must be preached in all the world  for a testimony then shall the end come though they should   ENDENTRY  be saved. This generation speak much about the clouds  and weather they disern the face of the sky but why  can they not disern the signs of the times. The fig trees  are leaving and all things indicate the second advent of Christ.     his testimony, be of good cheer, the testiment is not  in force while the Testator liveth when he died it was  in force so it is with Joseph, on the day of Pentecost  their was but 120 of the Saints, but at that time  their were added 3000 souls. when God sends a  man to do a work all the devils in hell cannot kill him  untill he gets through his work. So with Joseph He  prepared all things gave the keys to men on the earth and said I may be soon taken from you.     which gave an account of the death of ^the^ Prophet &amp; Patriarch  at the close of the meeting I went home and spent the night with a brother    ENDENTRY July 19, 1844    &amp; gave my note for it and $5 dollars of Brother Wingate  &amp; gave my note for that.
