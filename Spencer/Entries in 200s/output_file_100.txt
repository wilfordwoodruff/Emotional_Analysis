 there. Give me your earnest faith & prayers  that I may have the spirite and power  of my calling resting upon me. I know that  the prayers of a rightous man availeth  much. In regard to my health I will say  that my lungs keep in splendid condition  but my general health is not the best and  my constitution seems to be considerabely  weakened there is not that life and vigor  about me there used to be in fact the  life a missionary has to lead in some  of these districts will test any ones strength  but London will probabely be better—not  the atmosphere but the living. The Saints  here are so poor that they have to live  principleely on bread & butter and a little fish  occasionly. I regret that I did not bring  flannel instead of cotton garments the latter  are not fit for this climate especialy in the  winter season. But as I have gone this  long I will stick it out another year.  The conferences here are so poor that  they cannot pay expenses rents etc let alone 
 have melted away before you, and how unanimously at last has come the victory after so  many years of injustice and oppression, I have been forced to feel that the spirit of a  higher power than that of man has been controlling in the movements and destiny of your  people and in the final judgment toward them of the whole American people. All of us as  we grow older learn to value more and more highly the gifts that come to us through dis-  cipline, and it is a strange part of human life that nearly everything that is dearest  to us, most to be treasured, and most preservative of our liberty, comes to us dearly  bought by suffering, sacrifice, and often longtime oppression. Nearly everything dear  to human life has been gained along these high lines, where human endurance has been  tested, where character and patience have been put to bitter test, and where all that is   good and noble in a people has been developed under storm and trial. Neither in this  generation nor in any soon to come will the strange blessing of final independence which  has come to you and your people be fully understood. But for the spirit that drove you  into the wilderness to combat with the savage elements among men and the more savage  elements of nature, but for the necessity of industry, courage and patience, made necess-  ary by your battle for life in a country so wild and unfruitful at first as to be un-  friendly, but for the strange experiences through which practically the first two genera-  tions of your people have passed, your Church would never have been rooted and grounded  in the everlasting strength which I believe it now holds, and the strong men you have  developed would never have been discovered to you. So it may come out at last that a   Providence has been in it all, a Providence apparently unfriendly for many years, but  with the final proof that it was a loving Providence in the care of you all the time.  Yours will be a very fortunate people as time shall come and different generations shall   follow, if those who come after you shall prove as worthy, as true to everything that is  right in human life and aspiration, as courabgeous in the performance of duty, as the   strong and fearless men and women who first set up the standard of your Church in Utah  and who so loyally and fearlessly upheld it in the first generations of your experience  in the Rocky mountains:    While I never was among the American people who are intolerant toward the

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. April 1st, 1889.    President W. Paxman,    New Zealand.    Dear Brother: Your kind and very interesting communication of Feb. 23rd  reached us on March 19th. We were pleased to learn of the continued growth of  the Church, and of the progress you are making in the printing of the Book of   Mormon. Your request for $500.00 to help you meet your engagements with the  printers was duly considered by the Council of the Apostles, and in the present  straitened condition of the finances of the Church, it was decided that the utmost  we could do was to send you the amount you ask—$500.00—as a loan. We have  accordingly arranged that the amount be forwarded as desired by you, through  the Union Bank of Australia at Auckland. We have also sent to Brother Marriott  the £10.0.0 due him.    Among the Elders called for New Zealand was Elder Geo. T. Smith, of George-  town. His health was, however, so poor that when he reached San Francisco with  the other brethren it was considered advisable for him to return, which he did 
 assisting the Elders. The London Conference  is about 38 pounds behind with no imm-  ediate prospects of ammeleorating its con-  dition. I am pleased from reading the  minutes of the YMMIA Conference to learn  that they have passed resolutions to   withold all patronage from those people  who take a part in or in any way befriend  the present crusade against their parents  and friends—this action is very commendable  on their part. I returned last night from  a visite to Brighton. It is a very pretty  place and deserves its title of The Queen of  Watering Places. The Volunteer review took  place while I was there. I should think   200,000 would be a low estimate of the   number of people present. It was a pretty  sight to see 20,000 troops of all arms in   their uniforms of Red, green, blue, and drab  pass by in marching order 25 abreast they  were nearly an hour passing a given point  Well I will say good by, ever praying for the  blessings of heaven to attend you Yours etc Asahel. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS    P.O. BOX B.  Salt Lake City, U. T. May 23rd, 1889.    President William Paxman,   New Zealand.    Dear Brother: It was with great pleasure that we read your communication  of April 11th.  We have much joy in the progress of the work of the Lord in the  lands where you have charge; and we believe that the publication of the Book of  Mormon in the native tongue will have a highly beneficial effect among the natives.  Yiour course in reporting to them your receipts and expenditures will also greatly  add to the good feeling of the Saints.  The Maoris have evidently had their confi-  dence shaken by the methods of sectarian missionaries in financial matters. We  msust do our utmost to build up confidence in their hearts towards us, that they  may not only know that the Lord has revealed His gospel in these last days and  made us its ministers, but also that is fruits are manifested in our lives, and  that we have learned that all men are the sons of God and should be treated as   brethren in all the relationships of life.    We are pleased also to discover that you are establishing sunday scholols 
 state through this probation to its final  abode in the presence of God. I never heard  sutch a discourse in all my life. Pres.  Wells feels well, so does his wife and son  who are here with him, the latter on a  mission. We were all enjoying the hospitality  of Bro Crass of North London last night--  I say night because the greater portion  of us stayed up all night in consequence  of which I am a little blinky to day  We had an interesting entertainment to  which each one of us contributed, thus  having a jolley good time together. A number  of us are going to visite some places of  interest to day. Miss Quayle and I have  had a final separation, I have returned  her letters and feel as if a great weight  was removed from my shoulders, and am  free. I do not regret this termination of so  unfortunate an alliance. Good by and may  God protect and keep you in his holy  keeping, is the constant prayer of your  Affectionate Son    Asahel H Woodruff 
 Mormon Church, being of a liberal and tolerant mind, and having acquaintances with the  section of the Mormon Church located in Iowa, made up of as good people as we had in  that State, of course I never knew or had opportunity to know fully and distinctly all  the facts in regard to the career of your Church and people in Utah and the contiguous  western States. It was some ten years ago that in connection with Mr. Blaine, when we   were studying the elements of voters in the United States to try to secure a majority  for the political principles in which we believed, I first learned of the magnitude of  the Mormon people, the greatness of their development in many States besides Utah, and   the large part that they were sure to bear for good or evil in the destiny of this re-  public. Mr. Blaine and I were both surprised to see with what far-seeing wisdom the  pioneers of your people had looked into the future and had laid the lines along which  your descendants were to play a large part in the affairs of this country. Ever after  that both of us realized both how unjustly you had been dealt with in the past and what  a strong call there was upon the conscience of every lover of his country to endeavor  to see that you were dealt with more justly in the future. It was in this way, led by  my natural sense of justice and by my knowledge and by my realization of the wisdom   necessary to deal with all the composite elements making up the people of our country,  and my early recognition of the industry, patience, and good purpose of your people,  that I came to take so much interest in your welfare and became so willing to aid in  relieving you as much as possible of the wrongs inflicted on you in the past and to  secure to you a full share of rights as American citizens in the future.    It was in 1889 that the matter was projected before me so prominently, and at  a time when I was in such position as to have some official power in addition to my  personal influence, and fortunate enough to be near Mr. Blaine with his almost omni-  potent influence, that I took up in zealous manner the effort to serve you to the extent  of my ability. It was in this time that Colonel Trumbo, who has proved such a friend  to your people as I have never known any people to have, came upon the scene, and gave  to Mr. Blaine and to me such a practical and accurate knowledge of your exact situation  as to wrongs in the past and rights in the future, that we were enabled thereafter to 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,    Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 17, 1888.    President W. Paxman,    Dear Brother:    We wrote you by last mail but, being exceedingly busy at the  time, did not answer the two questions you asked in your favor of the 3rd of July  with regard to tracts and the emigration of our Maori converts.    We shall send you an assortment of tracts by the Elders who next  go to your field, and trust that by their means you will be able to accomplish much  good.    Respecting the emigration of the Maoris to this land, we feel  led to say that for the present you had better repress any inclination of that  character. If the work among the Pacific Islanders continues some provision will  doubtless have to be made for their future colonization and development. It is not  improbable that we shall be able to arrange after a while for some suitable place  in a milder climate than ours, a climate the seasons of which would be like their  own, and where it will not cost so much to live as it does in our own northern land.   The Sandwich Islanders are moving here in small numbers; but their position is not  such as is best adapted for their growth in those disrections that are desirable. 
 organize and conduct a contest in your behalf on lines that we knew were absolutely  right and as absolutely sure to win for you in the end. Of course, I need not say to  you, or to any of your people, how devotedly and wisely Colonel Trumbo over several years  has subordinated his own interests in life and made your interests the ambition and as-  piration of his every effort, and how with apparently more than human energy he has de-  voted every day and every thought of his life to your service. It has been almost en-  tirely through his influence, through the genius of his persistence in carrying the story  of your wrongs and rights to the door of nearly every influential man in the nation, of  his energy in assembling all these influences, and making friends for you wherever there  were good hearts to make friends with, that success has finally come to you. I have been   much in politics, and in many struggles. I have seen many successful men, gifted with  masterful and even peculiar powers in human affairs; but, as Mr. Blaine and I have often  talked and discussed, such a character as Colonel Trumbo, with his ability to make friends,  his ability to make people listen as to your wrongs and his power to convince them of   your rights, and his singular quality of assembling all these forces together, whether  represented in the public press, or in the organizations of the different churches, or  the more powerful influences of the most powerful corporations, and finally in the seat  of supreme power in the United States, Congress, has never before appeared on the scene  of American politics. It is not in my nature as a devout man and a believer in higher  powers, to reject the idea that he has been given for this work even more than the  strength of a man. It is refreshing in this age of cynicism and indifference in the  world to find friendship of this higher sort sacrificing personal interest and ambition  to a good cause and putting the success of that cause above everything else. Equally  marked and equally beautiful and worthy of admiration as Colonel Trumbo's persistent  and remarkable efforts in your behalf has been the unselfishness of his actions, the  subordination of self with no expectation of reward except the great joy of seeing  justice brought to you and your people at last. That you and all your people will  appreciate this, that you have no confidence too sacred to be given to him, that there  is no honor within your control too high to be offered him, that your children after you 
 2    They are employed as workmen in various occupations; but we think they should be in  communities where they can receive better advantages and be able to pay some at-  tention to the cultivation of the soil. We shall keep this matter before us, be-  cause it is one that we are already questioned upon by Brother Joseph H. Dean, who  has attained some success in preaching to the natives of the Samoan Islands, where  he and his wife have gone from the Sandwich Islands. The prospects there for con-  versions are very encouraging, and the steamer that carries this letter will con-  vey three Elders and the wife of one of them to the Samoan group, they having been  sent for by Brother Dean to assist him in his labors there.    In line with this counsel, we think it would not be a wise movement  for Brother Marriott to bring the young Maori sister of whom you speak, as it might  unsettle the people and make them desirous also of emigrating.    By the next steamer we expect the following brethren will sail for your  field of labor: Joseph Peter Beck of Paris; Hugh S. Geddes of Preston; Latimus O.  Taft of Salt Lake City and John H. Thompson ^also^ of this City; and possibly Matthias Fos-  ter of Meadow. By the November vessel two others will follow; they will probably  be Orson D. Romney of Salt Lake City, and Heber J. Waggstaff of American Fork. On the  October boat there will probably also leave William Bromley and George Edwin Wool-  ley of this City. Unless other arrangements are deemed desirable between now and  the sailing of that steamer they will on their arrival labor among the friends and 
 2    very reluctantly, as he was exceedingly anxious to honorably fill his mission.  Since he reached home we have deemed it wisdom to entirely release him, on  account of his poor health, and have encouraged him to the performance of those  duties which he can perform in the midst of the saints without imperiling his  life by the changes and hardships of a foreign mission.    Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now with you whom you can recommend  to succeed you when you are released to return home, or do you think it will  be necessary or desirable that some Elder specially called to preside in Aus-  tralasia be sent from here?    We are anticipating a largely attended and very enjoyable General Conference.  For the first time in several years the majority of the General Authorities of  the Church will, in all probability, be present. Myself, Elders Lorenzo Snow,   Franklin D. Richards, Geo. Q. Cannon, Moses Thatcher, J. H. Smith, H. J. Grant, John W.  Taylor and D. H. Wells expect to attend, and possibly Elder F. M. Lyman may be  released from the penitentiary in time to be present during the last day's ser-  vices. Presiding Bishops Preston, Burton and Winder will also be with us. We  hope to be able during the Conference to attend to several matters of importance  connected with the growth and development of the work of the Lord.    The day after Conference will be a busy one with us. About sixty Elders  will be set apart on foreign missions, principally to Great Britain, Scandinavia, 
 3    relatives of Brother Bromley in Australia. When Brother B. gets through minister-  ing to his friends he will most likely return, and Brother Woolley will be subject  to your instructions as to his future labors. Should Brother Bromley not find it  convenient to go Brother Woolley will report to you for instructions on his arrival  the same as the other brethren.    This morning Brother George Q. Cannon went to the Third District Court,  surrendered himself and plead guilty to two charges of unlawful cohabitation. For  a long time past he has felt strongly impressed that good to the work of the Lord  and to his brethren would result from such a course. He has been impressed that  his surrender would be followed by the lightening of the burdens now imposed upon  the Saints. Thus far his anticipations have proven correct. The Judge acted with  justice and moderation, not only in his case but in these that followed. You may  naturally suppose that his act of Brother Cannon's caused a sensation, and the  course of Chief Justice Sanford has not decreased the excitement. The great ma-  jority feel that both have done well, the rabid few are intensely angry. Should   the Judge continue his moderate course, I am of the opinion that other prominent  men will follow Brother Cannon's example, as it is most desirable for the growth  of the kingdom and the good of the Saints that the leaders of Israel should have   free access to the people to counsel, instruct and teach them as in former days.  We have reason to believe that Brother Cannon will be treated with kindness by 
 shall be taught to know the value of his services, I am sure from what I know of the  Mormon character will be true.    The story of the struggle of your people, as a people, and the later story of  the struggle of your Territory for Statehood, are both so interesting and absorbing that  it is hard to confine any analysis of it to anything like the proper limits and space  of a letter. But I feel it is due to you, who have been remote from nearly all the  phases of these struggles in the eastern States and out of your own Territory, to be  told by someone who has known of them and who can make the recital impartial something  of the details, to be left in your records in a form that will endure as a part of the  history of your Church and people. I take it up here with the attempt to disfranchise  your people in Congress in 1889, when a bill was introduced to add this further indignity  to the cruelties and wrongs of the Poland Act. It was then that Colonel Trumbo appealed  to me for help, feeling that I as a western man, as a man who had tolerance of opinion,  and especially as a man who was then in an official position of power, could help him  in resisting this further visitation of wrong upon you. He and I craved of Mr. Blaine  the use of his far greater power in your protection, and with his help we went before  the committee of Congress having this proposition of further wrong before it, and were  able to defeat it. If you could have the words, which seemed almost to be the words of  inspiration, as they fell from the lips of Mr. Blaine, protesting against this further  wrong to you, protesting against such an outrage upon any portion of a free people,  asserting that no republic of free men could tolerate such a wrong and li^v^e, I am certain  that they would be treasured in the affections of your Church and people as being only  second in comfort and power to the words of divine speech. I have always regretted that  no report was ever made of his appeal to that committee. It came up suddenly, was very  informal, no one thought of anything but what Mr. Blaine was saying, and he spoke so  deeply from the heart and from the best thoughts that ever arise from the human soul,  that his words came almost unconsciously to him and he was never able to repeat them.  I asked him afterwards if he could not, and he said that they seemed to come to him as  if on wings at a great and critical time, and they had passed away as suddenly and com- 
 3    Germany, Switzerland, Holland, and the State of pennsylvania. On the same day  the first Convention of the Officers and Teachers of our Church schools will  be held, to consider matters connected with the organization and conduct of our  Academies. The progress made since the General Church School Board was organized  has been very encouraging. Twenty Church institutions of learning are running,  with an attendance, during the past winter, of about fifteen hundred scholars;  and we do not think we overestimate when we say that double that number of schools  will be in operation the next school year. There is scarcely a Stake but what  has one or more schools now open, or is arranging to commence next August. The  chief difficulty that, at present, presents itself is the lack of suitable breth-  ren to act as Principals. Where they are all coming from is the question that  we cannot now answer, but when the time comes that they are needed, we doubt not  but, as in other things, the Lord will raise up men to accomplish this portion  of His work.    We are patiently waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court of the United  States in our appeal against the escheatment of Church property under the pro-  visions of the Edmunds-Tucker law. We expected it before this, but have been  disappointed. There is a miserable scramble going on in Washington for the Utah  Offices. The "ring" here are working for the re-instatement of Judge Zane, and 
 in the branches wherever practicable.  The fact that you have twenty-five such  schools now in active operation in New Zealand tells its own tale, and affords us  much encouragement with regard to the future of the Maori Saints.  These institu-  tions should be carefully nurtured, that the children of the native brethren and   sisters may early learn the truths of the gospel, and the false traditions and  superstitions of their ancestors be thereby so much lessened in influence in their  after lives.    We cannot give you any other counsel with regard to the emigration of  the natives than we have hitherto done.  We do not regard the present as an oppor-  tune time for such a movement.  Their childlike and confiding natures would un-  doubtedly be terribly shocked by things that they would now-a-days see and hear  in the midst of the Saints.  They must learn to abide in patience until the time  when the Lord signifies that some change should be made in our present instructions.  Encourage them to live their religion, and the Lord will accomplish all His purposes  with regard to them in His own time and in His own way.    We should be pleased to have you take whatever measures you and the Elders  deem wise and prudent to counteract the organized efforts of the ministers of the  various denominations to injure your influence and impede your labors amongst the  natives.  Show, wherever you have opportunity, how they have progressed in true  civilization since your advent among them; that they are more virtuous, more

 pletely, and there was left to him only the memory of his indignation at the wrong  proposed and of his duty to resist to the highest limit of his power such wrong and  encroachment. Of course, your people know something of the courage and loyalty of  Mr. Blaine towards you in oppression; but the summit and sublimity of it all was  reached when he stood in this small committee room and smote down with the giant  strength of his indignant wrath this further attempt in a free government to degrade  still further a people already wronged too much. If you but knew the burning words  with which he spoke, the spirit with which he spoke, I am sure that the name of Blaine  would never pass Mormon lips without the blessing of a prayer following the spoken  word or the unspoken thought.    This marked the limit of the high tide against the Mormon people in Congress.  Wrong had gone as far as it was possible for it in its malice to go. From that day it  receded. Having curbed it in Congress, then it became necessary to spread out the  feeling represented by Mr. Blaine over this wide nation and mollify all the great ele-  ments into something of the same feeling—nearly all of which, sharing in a preju-  dice and a hatred which were the more intense because of their ignorance of the facts,  were almost implacable at the mere mention of the name of Mormon. Religious intoler-  ance far outruns political intolerance, as you know; and, having checked the highest  tide of this feeling in political circles, it then became necessary in a government of  the people to go back to the sources of all the powers of Congress and mollify all the  great elements toward the final and ^end^ which has now come. In surveying the field Mr.  Blaine, Colonel Trumbo, and myself felt that the next step was to secure, first a   larger tolerance in the Republican party, and finally the active friendship of that  party in behalf of justice to your people and Statehood for your Territory. It had  been the fate of this party, driven forward by the crusade of the churches against your  Church, to be in possession of the government and therefore to enact and enforce the  laws that public sentiment coerced from Congress in enactment against your people in  some of your practices as a church. The first practical step to be taken along this  line was to take away from the so-called Liberal party in Utah, which had always been 
 4    the appointment of such men as McBride, Varian and "Kentucky" Smith (Idaho) to  other offices. Their hope is to get men into position to steal Salt Lake City  and Utah Teritory politically as they stole Ogden at the last election. Some  accounts represent President Harrison as quite prejudiced on our question, others  speak more favorably. We have hopes that he will not appoint local men to fill  the various U. S. offices in the Territory; at any rate, that he will not select  men such as those proposed by our enemies.    March has been a pleasant, warm and showery month, and the prospects for  water in some parts of the Territory during the coming summer are slightly improved  But as a general thing the amount of snow stored in the mountains is below the  average.    My health and that of the brethren associated with me is generally good, and  no contagious diseases prevail, to any extent, among the people.    Praying the Lord to continually bless you and all the Elders laboring with  you, that all your efforts may be crowned with success, and with love and kindest  regards,    I remain your Brother in the Gospel,    W Woodruff 
 sober, more cleanly, more industrious, and in every way better citizens since  they listened to the teachings of the "Mormon" missionaries. You can vindicate  your calling and labors by the fruits that have followed, and prove that your efforts  have been as priaiseworthy as the truths that you teach are impregnable.    As we hoped, the United States Supreme Court at Washington has reversed  the decision of the local courts in the case of Brother Hans Nielsen, taken up on  habeas corpus from Provo. He was first committed and sentenced for unlawful co-  habitation with a polygamous wife, then for adultery. The Supreme Court holds that  two separate crimes were not committed by his living with a plural wife, and sent  down an order ordering the discharge of Brother Nielsen from the penitentiary. He  had served his term for unlawful cohabitation and was serving out the one for  adultery. We understand that Preosecuting Attorney Peters and some other officials  are much chagrined at this decision. They had hoped to introduce the segregating  system in a niew and very odious form. Now they must elect which charge they will  proceed on. No doubt, wherever the evidence makes it possible, they will proceed  against the brethren for adultery, as the penalty, on conviction, is so much the  heavier. Arrests for the infractions of the Edmunds-Tucker law are still frequent  in the remoter portions of the Territory, but not so numerous as at one time. It  is said that there are at present more Territorial prisoners in the Utah penitentiary  thayn at any former time. The number of United States prisoners is less than it was 
 more an engine of injustice and oppression toward you than a representative party of  just sentiment, and which had finally become simply a means of persecution and money-  making, the apparent sanction of acting in the name of the Republican party of the  nation. To do this efficiently it was necessary to dispossess this Utah Liberal party  of its membership in the Republican National Committee, and to give admission instead   to the Republican party in Utah, and thus to gain entrance of the national party on the  local ground, where it could deal in justice and fairness with your people and take up  with intelligence the preliminaries of the final settlement which has now come in fair-  ness to you. To those of you who were remote and who know little of the national pre-  judice and of the difficulty of assembling the support of every State in a National  Committee, this may have seemed a trivial matter. I happened to be Chairman of the  Republican National Committee at the time, and even I, who knew much of this prejudice,   was surprised to find how obstinately the most of the members of the Committee held to  the old-time prejudice and how timid nearly all of them were as against the reproaches  of their people for rejecting the Liberal party in Utah and admitting to membership in  the National Committee a party that proposed tolerance and fair play to the Mormons the  same as all other Americans. It took a year of patient effort, of direct personal  appeal to almost every member of the National Committee, and more than that of system-  atic work to reach the influences back of these men personally, to give them the  courage to act along the line that we proposed. It happened that the meeting of the  National Committee where Utah for the first time was admitted to fair-play representa-  tion in any National Committee was held in Washington, where all the allied influences  against your people had their representatives on the ground for action. These influ-  ences stormed at the Committee, frightened away all but the most resolute men, and made  it extremely difficult to carry the matter successfully through the Committee. But it  was finally done, and when it was done the Liberal party of Utah was for the first time  cut off from connection with the supreme sources of national power. Colonel Trumbo may  sometime when he is with you, in the confidence that exists between you and in the great  affection in which he holds you, give you many of the details of that first struggle, 
 some time since. The total number is now 211; at one time it reached 252.    President Harrison has lately given considerable attention to Utah. He  has appointed a new Governor and Secretary and two new members of the Utah Commis-  sion. Our new Governor is Mr. Arthur L. Thomas, once Secretary of the Territory,   and more lately one of our Commissioners; the Secretary is Col. Sells, a lumber  merchant of Salt Lake City. The removal of Commissioner Thomas and the resignation   of Judge Carlton made two vacancies in the Board. These the President has filled  and the Commission now consists of Messrs. Godfrey, McClernand, Williams, Robertson  and Saunders. The last named was at one time Governor of Nebraska. The two  Democratic members are Messrs. McClernand and Williams; though Mr. Williams shows  very little true democratic principle in his dealings with Utah and her people.    There has been much apprehension felt throughout this region that water  for irrigation would be very scarce during the coming summer, and as a result  the crops would be exceedingly light. But these fears have been set at rest by  abundant rains in the valleys and snows in the mountains during the present  month. Already, in Salt Lake City, nearly two inches more rain than the average  has fallen since the commencement of May. In some neighboring valleys the differ-  ence has been even greater. As a consequence of so much rain and snow, the weather  is cooler than usual at this time of the year. In April—before the stiorm came—  it was considerably warmer than the average. 
 which may seem trivial now but which was the first necessary step toward success at all.    In thus helping to strike down the Liberal party by the hand of the official  national power of the Republican party, I gave assurance to almost every Republican of  influence and prominence in the nation, and to everyone whose help I finally succeeded  in gaining, that despite of the past, when Republicanism and Mormonism were made to  stand as deadly elements of opposition, the future would be one of fair play and one in  which your people would act on the lines of the future and not of the past. There was  the natural fear, of course, after the Republican party had enacted and enforced the  severe laws against Utah, that there would be treasured up in the hearts of your people  the natural feelings of enmity and revenge common to human nature. Utilizing all the   facts Colonel Trumbo had given me, and nearly always having him with me to bear testi-  mony to what I was saying and to answer every question that might be asked, I succeeded  in convincing enough Republican leaders to control the majority of the party that the  future Mormons, all of them instinct^lled^ with patriotism and love of country, all of them  believing in protection to American interests and industries, and all of them animated  by the common purpose of all Americans to serve the republic in its government of free-  dom faithfully, would be found and indeed would be forced by their own destiny as a  people to gravitate toward the underlying principles of Republicanism and Americanism.  The question was a mighty one, and nearly every prominent man to whom I talked when I  revealed to him the fact that this was not merely a Utah question but that the Mormon  people were spread through the valleys of eight or ten western States, and that sooner  or later they would hold the balance of power in the election of every Senator and of  every electoral vote for President in these States, was apalled at the fact and afraid  to trust to the forbearance of a people who had been so severely dealt with as a people  by the Republican party. I mention these things, which were the foundations on which I  laid our efforts to change the Republican party from being a party of opposition to  your people to one of friendship and support, that you may know how deeply the founda-  tions have been laid and that you may understand the expectation and confidence with  which the Republican party has come up so bravely at last to the line of doing justice 
 As requested by you, we have directed that a draft for £90.0.0, on the Union Bank  of Australia at Auckland, be sent you to pay the return fares of Elders A. L. Stewart,  Alexander Bullock and H. J. Burgess.    To recur again to the question of the emigration of the Maoris, we  find ourselves perplexed as to what arrangement to make for the Sandwich Islanders  who have emigrated to this city. There is quite a large number of them now here,  and the mode of life here is not suited to their proper training, and we have  felt very much exercised for their welfare. Three of the brethren who have labored  among them on the Island—Brothers W. W. Cluff, F. A. Mitchell and H. H. Cluff—have  been appointed, with three native brethren, to examine various locations that  would be suitable for them to settle upon. We desire to have them separated, to  some extent at least, from the temptations of city life, where they can be trained  to better advantage than they can here. If we find a suitable place, they will  move there; and we may find it necessary to appoint one or two Elders who are  familiar with the language to labor among them. When we have disposed of this  question in a successful manner, we can then perhaps take into consideration the  question of moving the Maoris also. They are kindred races, and the course that  will be taken with the Sandwich Islanders can also be adopted for them.    We feel that you should be released from your mission. You have 
 toward you all.    After this step in the National Committee, the next important chapter was to  overcome the prejudice existing with President Harrison and the influences almost uni-  versally exerted upon him, a man of peculiar religious prejudices and particularly open  to the appeals of the more intolerant Churches, and induce him to follow out the per-  mission of the law and the demands of justice and issue amnesty to all your people. This  was not dealing with one man, as may appear on the surface. If it had been, and that man  of the tenacious and obstinate character of this President, even that would have been a   great struggle. But we had to go back of him, and reach all the more intolerant Churches,  all the church papers, and lay a mollifying hand upon them and their prejudices, and take  upon our lips the words of Christian peace and gospel and appeal to them that, even  granting all they said against your people, there was everything in the teaching of the  Christian religion, when you had turned away from all things to which they objected, had  conformed to the law, and had as a Church under the revelation of the higher power to  which you conformed put away all these things, they should take you by the hand even  according to their own teaching and make you welcome with them and to equal rights in the  republic. We had to see and bring influence to bear on all the church papers; we had  to see the bishops and controlling men in all the strong Churches, especially the Catholic  and the Methodist. The Catholic, it is only just to say, was more inclined to the new  rule of fair play to you, while the Methodist Church was most tenaciously against it.  I was sent by the National Committee during the campaign of 1892 to renew the talk I had  already had at several times with the President in appealing to him to issue the procla-  mation of amnesty. He said that amnesity meant so much that for him to issue it was to  make an end of all the contest, that if it were done at all it should be an amnesity  complete and final and reaching all people who had come under the offense of the law,  and that to do this during a campaign, when he was a candidate for reelection, would be  considered by the prejudiced people among the Churches as an act influenced more by his  needs and ambition as a candidate than by his sense of justice and duty as a President.  He said that he feared all the church papers would oppose the act and condemn the pro- 
 performed a lengthy and faithful mission, and we do not think it wise to have  you continue there any longer. But before you leave we desire you to appoint one  of the Elders to take charge of the Mission, and notify us who it will be. We  hear Brother Angus T. Wright very well spoken of, and the brethren generally who  know him think he would be a very suitable Elder to take charge of the Mission  when you leave. If your views agree with ours, then you are at liberty to appoint  him and transfer the business of the Mission to him. Set him apart to preside  before you leave, and then you can return as soon as you feel led to do so.    Two of us—Presidents Woodruff and Cannon—returned a day or two ago  from a vnisit to the Sanpete Stake Conference. We had a very enjoyable time and   held ten meetings during our absence, one of which was at Nephi. We saw your  son there and other members of your family, and they were in good health; and  while in Sanpete we met your returned wife and child, and were very glad to see her.  She was in good spirits and health, as well as the baby.    We havo just got word that Judge Zane has been re-appointed Chief Justice  of the Territory. This, we hoped, would not occur, and have done what we could  to prevent it. It has not been our wish, nor for want of any exertion of ours  against him, that he has received the appointment. But the Lord will control his  acts for His glory and, no doubt, for our salvation; so we accept it with resig-  nation. 
 With love to yourself and all the Elders and Saints, and praying the  Lord to bless you and them in all your various labors for the advancement of the  cause of Zion,    We remain,  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith  First Presidency. 
 clamation, and he required that I should have all the editors of these papers seen,  and that I should test all the sources of power among the leading religious denomin-  ations. When you realize how many there are of these papers and how numberous are the  sources of religious power and authority, you can imagine something of the task that he  laid upon me. It was then that Colonel Trumbo came on to help in this work, and we were  fortunate enough also to have the benefit of the wise counsel and suggestion of Presi-  dent Cannon and General Clawson, who about this time came to New York and remained  several weeks, a fact which in itself was peculiarly fortunate and almost providential  in the line of success to our efforts. Difficult as this work was, we took it up, em-  ploying the help of many people, and finally secured a favorable expression from all th[e]  church papers in favor of showing confidence toward your people in their changed atti-  tudes, and quite a favorable expression from leading church authorities in favor of the  President's immediate and favorable action. The amnesty therefore would have been iss-  ued in October except for the affliction that feel^ll^ upon the President in the illness  and final death of his wife, when to the credit of his heart be it said everything else  even the campaign for his reelection, was made subordinate to his duties toward his dy-  ing wife. Influences counter to our wishes intruded on this effort from Mr. Elkins,  then Secretary of War, ^and for some strange reason from General Tracy, then Secretary of the Navy,^ the latter being influenced, I think, through some unrelenting  leading men in his Church, the Presbyterian. Mr. Elkins I think wanted to reach some  understanding with the authorities of your Church in behalf of some friends and inter-  ests he has in New Mexico. As you know, the amnesty was finally issued after the elec-  tion, and this act of a Republican President following the sanction and permission of  the laws of a Republican Congress put great power in our hands to influence all Repub-  lican elements in the contest to follow.    Then followed the contest for Statehood, in the winter of 1892-3. In prepar  ing for this we reached out and with systematic effort organized into friendly influ-  ences still more all the powerful elements of every State, by reaching the State Com-  mittees of our party, getting them in active line of friendship in their influence on  Congress, together with the members for each State of the National Committee. We also  kept up through the summer of 1892 our active efforts in mollifying all the strong ele 
 ments of the party and of the Churches, and especially of the newspapers, the latter be-  ing the power that men in Congress fear more than any other, for they depend on their  home papers to keep them right before their people and in public favor. I should not  omit to state somewhere in this letter, and here may do as well, the constant efforts  of Colonel Trumbo while all these things were going on, and his success in assembling  strong influences to accomplish it, in securing favorable action toward your people and  Church in the Department of Justice and the other Departments here where confiscation  of property and other outrages had been perpetrated or attempted. One of these was the  debts imposed by the Poland Act, amounting to nearly a million of dollars, which he was  thus able to save you from. Of course, these things you know as well as I; only I have  felt that reference should be made to them in this letter, which perhaps, with the papers  accompanying it, will be the most detailed statement put into written form of the strug-  gles of your people to emerge from the outrages of Congressional law, to escape penal-  ties laid upon you with so much injustice, and the final struggle of your Territory into  Statehood. Of course, I commit this letter to such purpose through you in the confidenc[e]  that grows up between men who heart to heart have made a struggle against the mightiest  of opposition in a common desire for success. I deal frankly with men, revealing to  you friends who are worthy of your remembrance and gratitude and also under a sense of  duty mentioning those who failed in the time of your need to support you with friendship  and met you with enmity and opposition instead. I do not believe in treasuring up even   a sense of wrong, nor nursing resentment, nor entailing revenge. Human nature is too  weak, the grave too near, the necessity for forgiveness too apparent, for these things  to be. They only dwarf those who entertain and exercise them, and make them appear in  something of competition and likeness with those from whose meanness they have suffered.  But I do believe that every man and every people should know and should remember through  time and generation the difference between those who win friends and those who win en-  emies.    There are some facts in connection with the struggle here in the winter of  1892-3 that should be made known to you in the deep confidence of this letter, and for 
 you to use your judgment in making known to others in authority with you, and the actual  facts of friendship and enmity. I very much coveted and so did Colonel Trumbo the ad-  mission of Utah to Statehood through a Republican Congress. Through our system of effort,  through the assembling of influences reaching into every State of the Union and almost  every neighborhood, reaching into the Churches, into business elements and corporations,  we succeeded in getting the bill through the House and in gaining practically a unani-  mous vote in the Senate, and were defeated only by the persistence of the Chairman of  the Territorial Committee, who, finding himself finally almost if not entirely alone in  his Committee in opposition to Utah, appealed to that thing called courtesy in the Senate  in order to defeat what had become practically the unanimous desire of the Senate, an  appeal in which he went so fare as to threaten to resign as Chairman if the majority of  the Committee should overrule him and favorably report the bill. We have never fully  ascertained, although we are satisfied that we know, the influences that acted upon him.   They came from Utah, from the Liberal party, whose leaders never abated any of their  efforts to defeat our endeavors, and who I am satisfied have never relinquished their  secret opposition up to the present hour. As you have already been informed, we went so  far and came so near success that through Senator Allison, who was Chairman of the Com-  mittee on Appropriations and who has been, I may say here, one of our most faithful and  powerful friends throughout the contest, as to succeed in getting the gate open on the  floor for Utah to be called in from the Committee at two different times in the Senate  during the absence of Mr. Platt. Colonel Trumbo and I had arranged with Senator Allison  in his committee room to go down and give the floor to Senator Carey. Each time the  Senator left us he said, "When I come back I will bring you the news that Utah is a  State." He did get the chance, but for some reason Senator Carey did not get in in time  and when the gap was opened other men jumped in and utilized the opportunity. I have   studied over this matter and investigated it a great deal, and I am satisfied finally  that Senator Carey erred in these matters only from lack of quickness of action. He is   a loyal man, and I am now satisfied has intended to be true to your people, and has  failed only where celerity of movement, quickness of brain and ale^r^tness of attention wer[e] 
 needed. We are pretty well satisfied now, after a whole year of investigation, that the  influences that acted upon Senator Platt to hold him in opposition, even after we had  secured every Church and political element who had acted with him before to appeal to him   to be favorable then, came from Utah, from Lannan, Thomas, and Goodwin, and that it was  secretly exerted through Senator Dubois of Idaho. We shall finally discover all the  facts, for it is well enoughf to know even after a campaign has been fought, in guarding  gainst similar occurrences in the future, all the facts in regard to treachery as well  as fidelity. I am fully satisfied that Utah would have been admitted by the Republican  Congress in February of 1893, except for the influence exerted upon Senator Platt, who  alone defeated it then through Senator Dubois. This impression has been confirmed by  the indifference and lack of earnestness of the same Senator in the contest of this  winter and spring. There can be no possible reason to excuse Senator Dubois against this   act of justice toward Utah and its people. He had lived in a Territory where the wrongs  against the people were merely a tithe of those against your people, and had suffered  from them and knew what they were. He had also received, even after he had been your  open and violent enemy, the strange and disarming thing of forgiveness and magnanimity  and support. He was bound by all reasons of honor that govern in the hearts of good men  to forget a past where your people had never wronged him, and after you had forgiven and  forgotten it to become a faithful friend. We have means by which we shall finally ascer-  tain the exact truths in regard to his action and his certain attitude. Meantime I  would not wish you and your people to go so far as to share my positive impression that  he was the successful enemy against you last year, and that he has been, if not an active  enemy this year, at least an indifferent friend. You are making history, and with that  high sense of justice which e^a^nimates all your actions as a Church and a people you will  insist upon knowing the whole truth before expressing judgment. We shall be able within  a year to give you these facts.    This winter and summer Senator Platt proved to be one of our best friends,  wisest counsellers, and most potential influences.    I should have stated earlier in this communication more of the names of the men 
 among the leaders in the Republican party who early identified themselves with this  movement and have as constantly served in it loyally ever since. Among the most promin-  ent I may mention Senator Quay, who until we took the matter up with him and caused him  to see the truth was amongst your most persistent opponents. For two years, however,  he has used all his great power and influence in your behalf. Ex-Senator Thomas C.  Platt of New York, who is in many respects the most powerful man in the Republican party  and who wields an unusual power in the business elements of the country, was among the  earliest, and has not only served with friendship and influence but helped the Colonel  and me in raising the means necessary to pay the expenses of the many difficult works  and systems we had to carry out—works which required the employment of very many people,  all for purely honorable purposes and yet for purposes which required personal visits to  every considerable community in the nation. Mr. Manley, of the National Committee, Mr.   Fessenden of Connecticut, Mr. Hobart of New Jersey, all also of the National Committee  and among its most powerful members, Mr. Payne, the Wisconsin member of the Committee,  Mr. Kerens, the Missouri member, Mr. L. S. J. Hunt of the State of Washington, who brought  into line nearly all the elements of that portion of the country, Secretary Rusk, now  dead, who was always active and always friendly, Archbishop Ireland of St. Paul, of the  Catholic Church, Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore, Ex-Governor Warmoth of Louisiana, who  has helped us very greatly in dealing with Southern elements, Mr. George M. Pullman, and  Mr. Runnells, his General Counsel, who helped us very much with the large business ele-  ments and corporations, Hon. B. F. Jones of Pittsburgh, Ex-Chairman of the National Com-  mittee, General Russell A. Alger of Michigan, who has been exceeedingly active among great  corporations and in church circles as well as political, Governor McKinley and Ex-Governor  Foraker of Ohio, who have proved friendly at all times and active in their friendship,  William A. Russell of Boston, one of the wealthiest men in New England, who has been aboth  active in help and liberal in means and has drawn into it in help many of the strongest  and wealthiest men of New England, Hon. F. W. Palmer, late Public Printer in Washington,  who has served us with peculiar ability and fidelity, Hon. Thomas Lowry of Minnesota, and  many others I might name and perhaps ought to name, have been as devoted friends as any 
 people ever had. These are elements, as you will notice, outside of Congress. In Con-  gress we had at the start the powerful help of Senator Allison, who was then the most  influential Republican in the United States Senate, and Speaker Reed of the House, these  two men furnishing out the most of the power we have utilized on the Republican side in  Congress. When Congress was Republican these were our leaders and main helpers.    This brings us down to the expiration of the Republican Congress on the 4th of  March. It is well enough to express again, with sufficient emphasis to make it endure,  that it was in the heart and intention of that Republican Congress to make Utah a State.  Ninety-nine out of every hundred of the Republicans in Congress favored this, the Repub-  lican President desired it, the Republicans in the House did their part towards it, the  Republicans in the Senate stood ready to do it, and the whole gracious act of Republican  intention was defeated only by the strange influence exerted upon the Republican Chair-  man of the Senate Territorial Committee, an influence exerted from your enemies in Utah  in some strange and secret and yet sufficient manner. It is well enought^f^, and I think  fair enough, that you and all your people should understand that the Republican party as  a party in Congress and in executive power desired and intended to give you Statehood.   It was only through that strange thing and its stranger power called courtesy in the  Senate that your disappearing enemies in Utah were able through the exercise of peculiar  power over one Senator holding a place of peculiar advantage, that this Republican inten-  tion was defeated. Let me say here clearly and plainly that this influence, whatever it  was, was not one of corrupt character, for no man ever lived who was further above cor-  rupt things than Senator Platt. In some way I think this malign influence in Utah exer-  cised through some Republican Senators from that region an influence on Senator Platt,  making him believe that it was necessary to defeat Statehood and that the sole reliance  for this necessity was on him.    This brings us to March, 1893. During the summer of [18]93 we kept in constant  motion all the influences through the organizations of friends we had perfected in every  State in the Union, not only to hold the turning tide toward friendship for you among all  the controlling elements of the nation, but if possible to increase this feeling into   friendship. We had able and strong and controlling friends at every influential church  gathering, all the Methodist conferences, and all the synods and associations of the dif- 
 ferent Churches held during the summer. All the time we had felt that the coercion  of church sentiment over men in Congress was the thing to be feared, for religious in-  tolerance is always last to release its grasp. We succeeded well and increased our chance  among these controlling elements during the summer; and this brings us to the assem-  bling of the Democratic Congress in December. During the extra session in the summer,  called by the President to meet the financial situation, our question played no part.  And when Congress met in December, Democratic in both branches, with a Democratic Pres-  ident, our situation had become irritated against us with the Democrats by the results  of the various State elections held in that year, including the one in Utah, where your  people had elected a Republican Legislature. Nothing during the whole time in which I  had been engaged in this movement has made the difficulty of it so plain as when it was  demonstrated that we had to go to a Democratic Congress, with the traditional intoler-  ance of the Democratic party against Republican communities and Republican interests,  and ask it to make a State of a Republican Territory. 
 This danger was heightened by the fact that the Democrats held their power in the Senate  by a slight majority, a majority sure to be decreased in some of the States electing  Senators this year and in especial peril against the probability of Republicanism when  Utah is admitted. It was our fortune and salvation in this dilemma that we had been able  in five years of constant effort to gain the friendship of the Republican party general-  ly, and to have it mobilized in such hearty manner that it was willing to play any part  of honor necessary to success. But it became necessary, of course, not only to gain Dem-  ocratic support for Utah, which had gone Republican, but to make the Republican friend-  ship and support as unobjectionable to the Democrats as possible and as unobtrusive as  possible. The Democratic party is wise always in its generation. They were not deceived  as to the Republican Legislature in Utah, nor could they be deceived, with the Wilson  Bill taking the profit of protection from everything raised on Utah ground or from under  Utah ground, of the tendency its people would naturally have in politics hereafter.  There is no doubt that it was the settled Democratic program in December not to admit  Utah, but it is also just as certain that as a party it intended to shirk the responsi-  bility for this and by tactics leave the responsibility on the Republicans. It was then  that the wisdom of our organized Republican strength was made apparent. The Utah bill  was brought into the House in December from the Democratic Committee, not with the in-  tention of passing it, but with the expectation and settled belief that it could be used  in tactics to Democratic advantage on the confident faith that the Republicans would   oppose and filibuster against it. It was brought in with the evident intention to shut  out and occupy the time desired by Republicans to defeat other Democratic measures. How-  ever, when it did come this expectation was disappointed. The Republicans by following  a splendid strategy under the leadership of Mr. Reed politely informed the confident  Democracy that instead of opposing Utah or filibustering against it they were friendly  to the people of Utah and in favor of admitting the Territory to Statehood. The bDempo-  crats had gone too far, they could not recede, and therefore the bill passed—another  strange evidence in this unanimity of both political powers that something higher than 
 human power and wisdom has been in this matter for its guidance from the first. No one  could have believed that in the same House where for so many years the name of Utah and  the word Mormon had been used to excite bitter contests, and where the Democrats always   stood to challenge the Republicans for their course towards Utah, the time had come when  both parties would act together as one man to admit it as a State. There is a blessing  in this for the State and its people, I am sure. Before leaving the question of its  passage in the House, I should say that in addition to Mr. Reed, whose powerful friend-  ship was so valuable, we had also the benefit of the almost equally powerful influence  of Mr. Burrows of Michigan, Mr. Dolliver of Iowa, Mr. Hooker of New York, Mr. Babcock  of Wisconsin, Messrs. Hepburn, Hull, and Lacey, of Iowa, and indeed of every one of the  stronger men among the Republican leaders. The only speeches made in opposition were  by Mr. Morse, Republican, the stove-polish man of Massachusetts whose opposition was  a help, and Mr. Harter, Democrat, of Ohio, whose intolerance of speech simply emphasized   the need for national sense and action.    The bill therefore went from the House to the Senate bearing the invincible  approval of unamimouss passage. Here the Democrats were placed in a dilemma. They still  professed to hold in cordial degree the same friendship that they undoubtedly had toward  Utah and its people in previous years, notably such men as Senator Faulkner of West Vir-  ginia, Senator Vest of Missouri, and Senator Coke of Texas. They assured us, since they  saw no chance of escaping and since they plainly saw they could not defeat Utah without  putting it on the ground of objection to the Mormons and without thereby forfeiting the  friendship of the Mormon balance of power in several States, that they would pass it and  give you Statehood for the holidays. But they did not meand it. They intended to hide  it away in the Committe, to keep it in the background, claiming that they were still in-  terested in it but that the absorbing question of the tariff bill had relegated that and  everything else of comparatively minor importance to the rear. Thus 1893 was concluded  and 1894 began. We saw very plainly that unless we could use in some way the passing  chances of the current contests in the Senate and be of service to one faction in the  Democratic party as against the other, we could not win. For it was both the party in- 
 tention and interest not to admit to Statehood a Territory whose two Senators would be  Republican and change the balance of power in the Senate. In addition to this, some  of the most powerful men in the Senate were opposed personally to the admission of  Utah or any other western States. I should have said further back in this letter that  all the time one of the most powerful elements we have had to contend against was the  eastern prejudice against the admission of any more western States, and especially of  any more silver States. The gold people of the East realize the danger to them of more  power going to the West and to the silver States. We have had constantly to combat this  influence, especially amongst all New England Members of Congress, both House and Senate,  and all the New York Members and all the Pennsylvania. Senator Hill of New York, the   most powerful Democrat in the Senate, came here in deadly hostility to the admission of  Utah or any more western States, and sought a place on the Territorial Committee in order  to make his opposition effective and in order more securely to guard the East against  what they considered the danger of the admission of more silver States and Senators. In  furtherance of this program of Senator Hill's he also had himself placed upon the sub-  committee of the Territorial Committee, together with Chairman Faulkner and Senator Platt  Faulkner a former undoubted friend but changed into secret opposition by the secret or-  ders of his party, and the latter the longtime enemy of Utah who the Democrats supposed  would continue that enmity and who could be used as a public scapegoat for the secret  Democratic opposition. Senator Gorman, the most influential Democratic members of the  Senate and the guardian of the party's interest, was also actuated by this fear and be-  lief that Utah would be Republican, and also by the eastern prejudice against western  or silver States. We found also as events developed not only this prejudice amongst  the eastern or gold States, but also a still more dangerous prejudice in the southern  States against the admission of any more western Territories on the ground that they  would become northern States and therefore help to decrease the power of the South.  Thus we had the dangerous opposition of the mercenary interests of all the eastern  States and of the political ambition of all the southern States, which, as you know,  are so covetous of power for the South in the government. In the face of the develop- 
 to defeat the nomination of Mr. Hornblower. Before doing so we secured the pledges of   honor of Mr. Gorman and Mr. Hill that they would favor the admission of Utah. But for  this opportunity we should have stood no show whatever, despite of all the powerful  influences we had assembled, to pass Utah into Statehood in this Congress. On the  second fight, over the nomination of Peckham, these gentlemen again appealed to us and  we again organized a line and gave them success. This increased their gratitude. Mr.  Hill from the first day changed about and has been our active, willing friend at any  call on our part and at every opportunity he could see himself to serve us. Mr. Gorman  did not come so promptly up to the fulfilment of his promise and kept wishing to post-  pone fulfilment until after the tariff bill. Indeed, it is certain that he went so  far with his power as Chairman of the Caucus Committee of the Senate, and therefore the  dictator of his party in the Senate, to instruct Senator Faulkner, Chairman of the  Territorial Committee, to keep the bill in that Committee and out of the Senate. Mean-  time we had been organizing our forces, and found a splendid ally in Senator White of  California, who has been from the first everything as loyal and helpful and vigilant   in your interest as he could have been if he had been a citizen of Utah and one of your  own people. He has had not only this friendship but he is a man of remarkable re-  sources, of experience in legislation, of determination in purpose, and peculiar facil-  ity for such work. He had rendered you a service your people can never fully repay.  While waiting on Senator Faulkner's movements, who kep^t^ delaying even a meeting of the  Committee to consider Utah and who kept going to West Virginia on days that had been  appointed for that purpose, and who employed every sort of tactics to keep us defeated  and yet in a good humor, we kept strengthening our lines in the Senate and also in the  Committee. Afther they exhausted all their excuses for the non-action of the Committee  they began to lay the whole blame on Senator Platt, who was the principal Republican on  the Committee. Senator Platt had still retained his opposition up to this time, despite  of our bringint^g^ to bear upon him the united influence of the party and many powerful  influences in New England and his own State. Finally he resented the idea of being  made responsible for what was in reality the secret Democratic program of non-action, 
 and he also found that he could not help to discriminate against Utah because it was a  western State without alienating from the support of the protectionists in the Senate  such western men as Senator Stewart and some others. He was too manly to bear off the  sins of the secret Democratic purpose, and was too mindful of the interests of the  East to help break the protection line or let any Republican Senator vote for the Wilson   or free-trade bill. Finally he came out flat-footed, declared himself for Utah's ad-  mission, and wrote Senator Faulkner a letter that he was in favor of admission and that  as a member of the sub-committee of the Territorial Committee for Utah he was ready to  report favorably. This broke the line, and with Senators White, Hill and Call, Demo-  cratic members of the Committee, favorable, and under the leadership of Seantor Hans-  brough, a Republican member of the Committee whose services I should have mentioned  earlier, we were able to stampede a favorable report from the Committee to the Senate.  This surprised the Democratic line again by tactics the same as we had surprised it by  the passage of the bill in the House. After it was out of the Committee and on the  calendar of the Senate it was not longer possible for the Democrats to defeat it except  by open opposition. I should have said at the outset of our program in the Senate we  found in Senator Hansbrough of North Dakota as valuable and helpful a fir[^ri^]end as we  have found any place in this contest. In conjunction with Senator Allison, who as an  older Senator had that acquired power which is peculiar to the Senate, and acting on  his suggestions, he has been our active and working friend and reliance in the Senate.  A member of the Committee, a western man who had lived in California and other western  States, exceedingly popular in manner and influential and respected by all who know him,  he was labored day by day and constantly in our behalf, not only in the Senate and in  the Committee, but coming almost every night to our rooms to help lay our plans and  programs. Many of the most valuable suggestions have come from him in making the fight.  I want you and your people to know that you never can owe more to any man outside of  your own people than to Senator Hansbrough. He is a young man, in his first term in  the Senate, but sure to be returned and to become one of the most powerful members of   this exalted body, so that his friendship in the future will be as valuable as it has 
 been in the past.    The contest in the Senate has been one of such detail, changing every day  and frequently every hour in such strange manner, that it is impossible for me to  recite it to you with anything like fidelity here. Suffice it to say that it has been  such a peculiar situation that we have never been able to leave the ground. Colonel  Trumbo and I have remained here since November and devoted ourselves entirely to an  alert, vigilant, constant watchfulness of the situation, ready to detect danger at  the first moment or to utilize an advantage at every opportunity. We have had to  enter into nearly every contest unknown to the public to serve this or that friend or  to gain the friendship of this or that element. We have built up our work as a stone-  mason a wall, stone by stone, laying our hopes in solid mortar and rearing a solid  structure on which we felt, despite of the opinion of nearly everybody else and in-  deed of all the experienced men in Congress, that we should win at last. We have had  in Senators Allison and Hansbrough and in other Senators in less degree, constant  watchfulness and service. On the Democratic side Senators White and Hill have been  supreme in help. It has taken the wisdom of many men to win this difficult fight.  Among others I should mention that Mr. R. C. Kerens, whom I have already mentioned,  member of the National Committee from Missouri, has come on and spent weeks of his  time in our service. He is a friend to remember, for he has been both useful and   faithful. ^I wish I might give you too the names of all our faithful friends.^ Indeed, you can take the Republican roll call, and I may say of  it that two thirds of the names represent loyal and active friends and the other  third men who have been borought to friendship through influence and conscience. The  same may be said of the mass of the Democratic Senators, who when the situation had  to be faced faced it on the side of manliness and justice and voted on the right side  despite of their party's interest and their own secret party desire to keep the Terri-  tory out because it was Republican.    There is another and more delicate matter, which I have confided to General  Clawson, who has been here with us and whose counsel and vigilance have been in the   highest degree valuable, and whose courage and cheerfulness have furnished strength  and confidence to both of us; and he will confide it to you. These means, used for 
 purely honorable purposes and yet for necessary things, were raised entirely from Repub-  lican sources because of friendship for your Territory and your people and because of  confident faith that the Territory was to be identified with Republican policies and   ambitions. This help has come freely, has been used wisely, and without it success could  not possibly have been achieved. It has been used with as much honor and to as good re-  sults as conscience could suggest or honesty require.    In closing this letter, which is so long that I fear it may weary you but yet  which I could not make shorter and which indeed I might have made longer under my sense  of fidelity to all the friends we have found, I am constrained by such a sense of appre-  ciation as I have never been called upon to feel before, to refer again to the strangely  loyal and successful and splendid service which over long years and in the face of every  obstacle and against impediments which would have dismayed any other man I have evenr  known, Colonel Trumbo has served you and your people. It has been beautiful to me to see  such a friendship possible in the human heart. His ambition for your people, his deter-  mination to lift them up out of wrong into victory, to compensate them for the injustice  they have suffered, to make them known to all the American people for their honesty of  character and their purity of good intentions, and the dedication of his life to the end  of making the Mormon name as honorable and as accepted in honor in the sight of every  high minded American, have renewed my faith in human nature. It has inspired my own  heart to see how he has been actuated also by loving friendship and devotion to you. No  son whom I have ever known could be more loyal, and no son I have ever known has served   a father as well as he has served you. It has been, as he has constantly said to me,  not only his ambition to accomplish this desired vindication for your people, but also to  accomplish it in your time and under your Presidency, while you were still the shepherd  of your people and the hope of all our hearts.    Whatever appreciation you shall show to him, whatever honor you may offer to  him, it will be deserved. In addition to the gratitude you shall forever owe him, I   feel it as a sense of duty to you as well as to myself, and to the pledges I have every-  where made, to say that I think he should be sent on your own motion as one of the men 
 to represent you in the United States Senate. No other man could possibly represent you  to your benefit and to your vindication as he can. No dozen men nor any hundred men  among you are as well known as he is to the powerful and controlling men not only in Con-  gress in this later time, but throughout the country. You know, and this is realized  probably more by President Cannon than any other member of your people, that experience  and acquaintance are necessary in a Congressman or Senator to serve his people fully and  faithfully. If Colonel Trumbo had been a member of the Senate ten years he could not have   gained more acquaintance and friendship to your advantage than he has gained now. Uni-  versally the people of the country and the people in Congress look to him as representa-  tive of Utah. This fact of itself is sufficient for my position. The friendships he  has formed, the acquaintance he has gained with the most powerful elements of the country,  will all be in your service. Besides, no one else will ever know and therefore no one  else could ever redeem as he can, the thousands and thousands of obligations that we have  incurred in this long contest in your behalf. He knows many things that none of you will  ever know, and yet things that a people or a State can no more afford to forget or fail  to fulfill than any man of honor. I feel my own honor involved in the representation of  the State of Utah in Congress. This whole matter has been on my conscience as nothing in  my public life has ever been. I was the first to take up in detail the position taken  by Mr. Blaine, and the first to carry it to the attention of the Republican leaders in  detail, and the first to organize and assemble all the party influences in your behalf.   Very much of the action taken by others has been taken on my assurance of honor that I  was not being misled, that yours were a people in whom faith could safely be placed, and  that your destiny as a people and a State ran in the same grooves with Republican pol-  icies, Republican patriotism and Republican interest. I shall feel that I am on the bond,  that my honor stands for guaranty, and therefore that I am at liberty, and indeed con-  strained by the highest sense of duty that can actuate an honorable man, to make known to  you the obligations which rest upon you in these sacred regards.    I ought to say also, and will say in brief, that we have carried in parallel  with our contest for Statehood the material interests of Utah, that we have never for-  gotten the industrial and social ambitions of your people, that we have brought to the 
 attention of everybody with whom we have come in contact the empire of natural wealth  and resources and industrial possibilities in your borders, and your ambition as a   people and a Church to develop a community which will be an example of American in-  telligence and merit and conservative of the highest average good to every citizen, and   always regardful of all true interests of the republic. The railroad enterprise has  been in some degree a backbone in our endeavors. This enterprise can be carried for-  ward and can be made the means not only of fulfilling many obligations that we have in-  curred to many prominent men whose help has been vital, but also of gaining to your  State their personal interest and valuable friendship. It is the destiny of your State  to parallel the career of the most prosperou^s^ States in the Union, prosperous in a   material sense and ranking highest in the noblest senses. Since I have become identi-  fied in sympathy with your people and your ambition the possibilities of Utah have con-  stantly grown upon me, and I shall find much of my future life I am sure involved with  your people and your ambitions. Here occurs to me something I ought to have said earl-  ier, and that is that in securing the help of many of the most powerful elements which  have come to our assistance I have not only given assurance that there will be no cause  for dissatisfaction with the men who shall come to represent the State of Utah in Con-  gress, but that the elements of discord in your Territory will be pacified or removed.   I know it is in your ambition as a people to make your ways by peaceful methods, and   this is the high duty of all leaders of men and of all associations of Christian people.   The arch enemy of your Territory and your people has been a newspaper, ably edited,  almost satanic in its ingenuity for mischief, relentless and cruel, and ever sure to  remain an element of harm and injury if left to its present control. I have given the  assurance that this will be changed, and I have done this confident in the action I   represented faithfully the wisdom and fidelity of your intentions. I think this prop-  erty should be purchased, and I have pledged that it shall be representative of Repub-  lican policies, and I am willing to take it up in connection with such people as you may  assign and help to organize it or do anything in the matter which the common interest  may suggest or your people desire. The necessity for control of this engine of good or 
 evil is heightened by the fact that such people after defeat are capable of nothing but  bitterness and desire for revenge. While it can never control again, it can always make  mischief, it can always be a subject of annoyance and an element of discontent. There  ought to be no trouble in securing it, for the men who control it are actuated only by  mercenary interests and therefore are open to negotiation and arrangement.    There is another suggestion that I feel that I ought to make to you in view   of correcting evil impressions in regard to Mormonism and its people in all that wider  world outside of Utah, and that is that either in Chicago or New York, and in both would  be better still, should you in some way secure the friendship of an influentail news-  paper in each of the great political parties of the country. To me, while I have been  in five or six years canvassing this subject with the people of every State in the Union  and with people of all shades of opinion and degrees of intelligence, it has been sim-  ply astonishing that such dense ignorance as well as such malicious prejudice exists  everywhere in regard to the real fiber and actual character and purpose of your people.  We have been exceedingly fortunate in our general arrangements and in our effort to  systematize and mobilize all the strong and controlling elements in your favor, in  reaching the influential newspapers of the political parties, as well as of the Churches.  After this I fear many of these publications will naturally lapse into the old-time  feeling, and offer nothing by way of resistance to the prevailing prejudice against you,  nor by way of enlightenment of the public in regard to your actual merits and ambitions  as a community and a people. Undoubtedly the plowing that we have done in every influ-  ential community of the nation will yield good things to you constantly hereafter; but  it is very important in my judgment that you have in one or both of the great commercial  centers of the country such friendship on the part of one or two strong newspapers as  will at all times, without appearing to be special pleadsers for or special champions of  you, defend you against false accusation, and gradually give to all the American people  the actual facts in regard to the Mormon Church and its good purposes, to the Mormon  people with their refinement and education, their love of gentle things in life, their  artistic development, their ambition to rear their children and their States in all the 
 finer things of life, and their aspiration indeed to make themselves fully the equal of  any American in every test and accomplishment of civilization and refinement, as well as  of Christianity. I shall find it my pleasure, as I have already done in large measure,  to keep supplying to the magazines, to the houses printing syndicate letters, and all  other diffusive agents, such information as will tend to correct the false impressions  existing in this country in regard to the degree of intelligence and the measures of am-  bition of your people. In the magazines you will have a hearing that will be internation^-^  al as well, and along these high lines of publications read by all the more intelligent  people of the world constant effort to render to you all actual justice on your merits  will be advisable. As I have before suggested, I think, in a letter to President Cannon,  a book written in comprehensive manner by someone having the historical quality of anal-  ysis and the judicial quality of fairness and some one not a Mormon, ought to be written  and printed, giving to the world the facts as to the Mormons of today and what they are   and aim to be in every feature and respect.    In reading over my letter after having progessed this far, I notice that I  have omitted any mention, in the hurry of writing, of the one man who through the long  period of your years of trial has stood by you more faithfully than any other public man  outside of your own people. I refer to Senator Teller of Colorado, who has been a tower  of strength to you in all the crises of your career, and who has stood in the Senate and   acted throughout the nation whenever called upon to do so with all his power in your  sufficient defense. No public man of today stands higher in the respect of the American  people than Senator Teller, and his record for sincerity, his approved statesmanship, which  has stood the test of many contests, have all been of wonderful and saving help to you in  the last year, and especially in these nervous months of the contest before the present  Democratic Congress. I need not multiply to you, however, any words of commendation of  this spendid man, for he was deep in your hearts and affections even before you knew of  me, and once there will always remain with abiding appreciation.    Neither do I wish to leave the impression that I fear I might have done if I   left this letter with no further reference to the good work done in your behalf by influ- 
 ential Democrats in this Congress. Mr. Rawlins, your Delegate, has been faithful, capable  earnest and vigilant, and has done all that could have been expected of him, and is en-  titled to your gratitude and praise. In the House, such Democrats as Mr. Geary of Calif-  ornia, Mr. Washington of Tennessee, Speaker Crisp, Mr. Wheeler, Chairman of the Territor-  ial Committee, and many others who might be mentioned, and in the Senate such Democratic  leaders as Mr. Blackburn, and finally Senator Jones of Arkansas, have constantly rendered  good and very valuable service. I am satisfied that if the settled purpose of the Demo-  cratic leaders at one time to deny sStatehood in some secret manner or in such way as to  leave the blame on the Republicans had been carried into the field of open attempt, leav-  ing us to call upon the Republican leaders to force the bill to a passage, we could have  carried a solid Republican line in both houses, and enought Democrats of good faith and  fairness would have voted with us to carry the bill. Indeed, if it should come that  President Cleveland should veto the bill, I have faith that we could pass it over him with  a solid Republican line and enought from the Democratic side to give us the necessary two  thirds. But so far as we can learn up to this time, President Cleveland is ready to sign  the bill. His expressions have been favorable, his views are very broad, and his own in-  tentions I have no doubt are all favorable to the measure. The only danger in that source  lies in the secret influence that may be exerted upon him from the eastern States and the  gold people of the eastern States, to which influences he is peculiarly susceptible, and  to the influence of Democratic leaders from sSouthern States, who are opposed to any more  northern States. Yet Colonel Trumbo is confident that through the President's favorable  disposition, and with the help of Attorney General Olney and Secretary Carlisle and Sec-  retary Morton, he can gain the coveted Presidential approval.    The delay put upon you by the terms of the bill, in postponing the realizations  of Statehood practically until 1896, were unavoidable. Without these provisions it would  not have been possible to pass the bill without endangering it at the White House. The  solid Republican line in the Senate wanted to amend these features, and we could have  passed the bill as they desired it, but it was not advisable to give any partisan color  to it nor afford any partisan reason for Mr. Cleveland to disapprove it. We have carried 
 things from the first along the line of the aspiration to make it unanimous, to tran-  quilize all the elements, and to bring Utah into the Union a welcome member of the fam-  ily and welcomed by all elements. Things have moved in a mysterious way to this end,  and the devout may well think that the hand of God has controlled in it, bringing a  blessing for all time with it.    I hope to visit Utah within a short time, and renew with you and your people  the pleasant acquaintance of heretofore, and in the freedom of such interview talk over  this great struggle and bring to your attention and knowledge many things which no doubt  you and your colleagues will be glad to know. In conclusion I wish to express my own  great personal sense of satisfaction that I was permitted to bear a part in this diffi-  cult struggle in a noble cause. It has been with increasing pleasure that I have found  in every year, and almost in the developments of every day, my faith in your people con-  firmed and my good opinion increased. It has gradually grown, beginning with 1889, to be  an absorbing question in my life, and it has been a pleasure for me since that period to  subordinate my own interests to the one aspiration I had come to share with you to make  Statehood certain to you, and to make it certain in such a way as would by the testimony  of the American Congress vindicate you and your people from the obloquy of the past. I  am also glad that the shepherd star of Utah, symbolizing as no other star has ever done  an ambition to serve the common people, and the solidarity and destiny of all your people,  has appeared in all its sovereignty and beauty upon the flag of our country during the  time of your faithful and loving administration as President of your Church. I shall al-  ways account it an honor and a pleasure, to be treasured by my children and held by them  in sacred memory, to have been associated with yourself, with Presidents Cannon and Smith,  General Clawson, and the other good men of your membership, in this praiseworthy enter-  prise of gaining justice to a noble tTerritory and a worthy people. I believe that in the   blessing coming to you with Statehood, a blessing to the spirit and the pride of your  people, this long contest, ending successfully, will also be the means of bringing to your  State countless jmaterial blessings. It has made your resources known to all the intelli-  gent people of the republic, to nearly every community, and this information will bring to 
 you speedily and in vast volume the capital necessary to develop your natural wealth, to  create your factories, to build your cities, and to make you splendid in everything that  commercial ambition and political aspiration may desire.    Hoping you may be spared many years to continue your gentle rule over the peopl[e]  you love so much, and invoking for you and all your people the highest prosperity and  God's blessing always, I am,    Sincerely yours,    [ James S. Clarkson ]    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah. 
 P.S. It has occurred to me, as I have read this letter over that it would   not be just to let it go to you, and into the records of your people, without  referring to the early, continuous, and remarkably influential and valuable  services of the Hon. M. M. Estee, of California. It may seem superfluous in me  to do it, since you and all of your co-laborers know in far larger degree than  I of the fact and measure of his important and devoted services. In the dignity  of his strength, and with the profound respect for him in the nation, his early  testimony to your honor and merit as a people and a Church, his ceaseless efforts  to correct the wrong and false impressions of the Mormon character and purpose, and  his loyalty in attesting your good-citizenship and your patriotism and love of  the Republic in common with all American citizens, all served you to great results,  and helped potentially in changing the opinions of many leaders of public thought  and party action. I have heard him in many social and political gatherings in  Washington, New York, and Chicago, speak of these subjects; and always he convinced  the most of his hearers of the truth and justice of his opinion of the good faith  and merit of the people of Utah. You will need some great lawyer, versed in  constitutional law and profound in legal wisdom, to draft your Constitution.  Judge Estee, I understand, was largely the author of the original and also the  revised Constitution of California—an instrument which might well be taken as  the model for your Constitution, as it was taken for North Dakota and other Western  States. It would be a graceful act of remembering friendship to commit to Judge   Estee the work of framing a draft for the Constitution of Utah.    In writing this whole letter I have been keenly conscious of omitting  reference to the many good works done, in line with the general effort in the nation,  by men of your own fold and faith. I have fully appreciated the great value of  their service, and yet I felt that I was not entitled to try and tell you of the  great work done in the nation by your own people—from President Cannon, with his  almost unrivalled abilities and fidelity, of which I have often heard Mr. Blaine 
 speak in words of cordial estimate and admiration, down through many others. But   I did not feel I had any commission or indeed excuse to tell you what you already  knew of your own faithful men. As I have referred to it, I cannot refrain from  speaking from my own knowledge of the especially admirable and capable work  accomplished by Mr. Frank J. Cannon, one of the younger of your influential  brethren, but who, like Aaron, is noted among his brothers for the eloquence and  grace of the speech. Before Committees of Congressmen, before Committees of   Republicans, and before popular gatherings, including a Republican National  Convention, he has held up your standards and proclaimed your noble ambition as  a people, with a persuasive force and enkindling fervor that have wrought great  things in placating prejudice and winning the good will of good people throughout  the nation. I have seen so much of his good and faithful work, in places remote  from you, and in acts unknown to you, that I cannot gain the consent of my own   heart to close this letter without at least speaking of the marked fidelity and  value of his services.

 ANNUAL CONFERENCE.    The services of the Conference were  continued this morning in the upper  room of the Temple.    The Tabernacle choir sang the an-  them:    Let all Israel join and sing.    (Music by Joseph J. Daynes; choir-  isters led by Evan Stephens.)    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    Made brief appropriate remarks and  then offered the    DEDICATORY PRAYER,    as follows:    Our Father in heaven, thou who hast  created the heavens and the earth, and  all things that are therein; thou most  glorious One, perfect in mercy, love and  truth, we, thy children, come this day  before thee, and in this house which we  have built to thy most holy name, hum-  bly plead the atoning blood of thine  Only Begotten Son, that our sins may  be remembered no more against us for-  ever, but that our prayers may ascend  unto thee and have free access to thy  throne, that we may be heard in thy  holy habitation. And may it graciously  please thee to hearken unto our peti-  tions, answer them according to thine  infinite wisdom and love, and grant that  the blessings which we seek may be  bestowed upon us, even a hundred fold,  inasmuch as we seek with purity of  heart and fulness of purpose to do thy  will and glorify thy name.    We thank thee, O thou Great Elo-  heim, that thou didst raise up thy ser-  vant, Joseph Smith, through the loins of  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and made  him a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, and  through the assistance and administra-  tions of angels from heaven, thou didst  enable him to bring forth the Book of  Mormon,—the stick of Joseph, in the   hand of Ephraim,—in fulfillment of the  prophecies of Isaiah and other Prophets,  which record has been translated and  published in many languages. We also  thank thee, our Father in heaven, that  thou didst inspire thy servant and give  him power on the earth to organize thy  Church in this goodly land, in all its  fulness, power, and glory, with Apostles,  Prophets, Pastors, and Teachers, with  all the gifts and graces belonging there-  to, and all this by the power of the  Aaronic and Melchisedec Priesthood,   which thou didst bestow upon him by  the administration of holy angels, who  held that Priesthood in the days of the  Savior. We thank thee, our God, that  thou didst enable thy servant Joseph to  build two temples, in which ordinances  were administered for the living and the  dead; that he also lived to send the  Gospel to the nations of the earth and  to the islands of the sea, and labored  exceedingly until he was martyred for  the word of God and the testimony of  Jesus Christ.    We also thank thee, O our Father in  heaven, that thou didst raise up thy  servant Brigham Young, who held the  keys of thy Priesthood on the earth for  many years, and who led thy people to  these valleys of the mountains, and laid  the corner stone of this great Temple  and dedicated it unto thee, and who did  direct the building of three other tem-  ples in these Rocky Mountains which  have been dedicated unto thy holy  name, in which temples many thousands  of the living have been blessed and the   dead redeemed.    Our Father in heaven, we are also   thankful to thee for thy servant John  Taylor, who followed in the footsteps of  thy servant Brigham, until he laid down  his life in exile.    Thou has called thy servants Wilford  Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, and  Joseph F. Smith, to hold the keys of the  Presidency and Priesthood this day, and  for these shepherds of thy flock we feel  to give thee thanksgiving and praise.  Thy servant Wilford is bound to  acknowledge thy hand, O Father, in  the preservation of his life from the hour  of his birth to the present day. Nothing  but thy power could have preserved him  through that which he has passed during  the eighty-six years that thou has grant-  ed him life on the earth.    For the raising up of the Twelve  Apostles, we also thank Thee, our God,   and for the perfect union which exists  among us.    We thank thee, O Lord, for the perfect  organizations of thy Church as they  exist at the present time.    O Lord, we regard with intense and   indescribable feelings the completion of   this sacred house. Deign to accept this   the fourth temple which thy covenant  children have been assisted by thee in  erecting in these mountains. In past  ages thou didst inspire with thy Holy  Spirit thy servants, the Prophets, to   speak of a time in the latter days when  the mountain of the Lord's house should  be established in the top of the moun-  tains and should be exalted above the  hills. We thank thee that we have had  the glorious opportunity of contributing  to the fulfillment of these visions of  thine ancient seers, and that thou hast  condescended to permit us to take part  in the great work. And as this portion  of thy servants' words has thus so mar-  velously been brought to pass, we pray  thee, with increased faith and renewed  hope, that all their words with regard to  thy great work in gathering thine Israel  and building up thy kingdom on earth  in the last days may be as amply fulfilled,  and that, O Lord, speedily.    We come before thee with joy and  thanksgiving, with spirits jubilant and  hearts filled with praise, that thou hast  permitted us to see this day for which,  during these forty years, we have hoped,  and toiled, and prayed, when we can   dedicate unto thee this house which we  have built to thy most glorious name.   One year ago we set the capstone with  shouts of Hosanna to God and the  Lamb. And today we dedicate the  whole unto thee, with all that pertains  unto it, that it may be holy in thy sight;  that it may be a house of prayer, a house  of praise and of worship; that thy glory  may rest upon it, that thy holy presence  may be continually in it; that it may be  the abode of thy Well-Beloved Son, our  Savior; that the angels who stand before   thy face may be the hallowed messengers  who shall visit it, bearing to us thy  wishes and thy will, that it may be sanc-  tified and consecrated in all its parts  holy unto thee, the God of Israel, the  Almighty Ruler of mankind. And we  pray thee that all people who may enter  upon the threshold of this, thine house,  may feel thy power and be constrained   [t]o acknowledge that thou has sanctified  it, that it is thy house, a place of thy  holiness.    We pray thee, Heavenly Father, to  accept this building in all its parts from  foundation to capstone, with the statue  that is on the latter placed, and all the  finials and other ornaments that adorn its  exterior. We pray thee to bless, that  they decay not, all the walls, partitions,  floors, ceilings, roofs and bridging, the  elevators, stairways, railings, and steps,  the frames, doors, windows, and other  openings, all things connected with the  lighting, heating and sanitary apparatus,  the boilers, engines, and dynamos, the  connecting pipes and wires, the lamps  and burners, and all utensils, furniture  and articles used in or connected with  the holy ordinances administered in this  house, the veils and the altars, the  baptismal font and the oxen on which it  rests, and all that pertains thereto, the  baths, washstands and basins. Also the  safes and vaults in which the records  are preserved, with the records them-

 The following questions having been  propounded, were read by President   Woodruff, with the answers given by the  Superintendency:    When County or Association officers  are called away on missions, should   their places be filled temporarily or per-  manently?    Vacancies should be filled, whenever   they occur, permanently.    Should regular quarterly conferences  be held in each Stake?    Yes, and the dates supplied the Gen-  eral Secretary, so that appointments may  be made by the General Superintend-  ency of officers to attend them.    Should systematic Scriptural exercises  be insisted upon?    It is desirable to encourage the study   of the Scriptures, and to accomplish the   most in that direction, system is neces-  sary. To facilitate the adoption of a   simple system that will not be too  straight-laced, it is proposed that we  publish a pamphlet containing sugges-  tive programmes, Scriptural subjects pro-  perly arranged, etc. This will probably   be done by the commencement of an-  other season.    Should non-members of the Church  be admitted as members of Associations?    As a rule they should not, but the offi-  cers must be governed according to cir-  cumstances.    Should ladies preside alternately or at  any time at the conjoint sessions of the  Associations or at the Quarterly Confer-  ences?    Ladies should not preside where  mixed meetings are held and men hold-  ing authority are present.    Should officers be set apart, and by  whom?    Officers should not be set apart; no  one is specially authorized to perform   that labor. 
 ELDER W. WOODRUFF    Said the Church of Jesus Christ of   Latter-day Saints was organized 52  years ago, on the 6th of last April,   and since that time it has furnished  a grand school for the Elders of  Israel to be educated in, not only  in doctrine but in the principles of  government. The Priesthood is one  of the most delicate and important  gifts that was ever conferred upon  man on the earth. There are many  called and but few chosen. Many  have been called not only to the   Aaronic but the Melchisedec Priest-  hood. The Prophet Joseph organ-  ized the Church in 1830 and the  world have been afraid of it ever  since. He organized it by revela-  tion. He had no power to accom-  plish what he did except on the  principle of revelation. The inspi-  ration of Almighty God is the only  power by which any of us in our  day can do anything towards the  building up of the kingdom of God[.]  All that was ever spoken and placed  on record by the ancient prophets  and patriarchs was under the influ-  ence of the Holy Ghost, and all  their prophecies, if they are not ful-  filled, will be fulfilled in the due  time of the Lord. Adam spoke by  the Holy Ghost, and his words will  be accompiished. God will not dis-  appoint the expectations of His  Saints. He has set His hand to   carry out the great programme of  the iast days. The nearer we got to  the Lord the more faith we have,  and the farther we are off from Him  the less our faith will be and the  more likely we are to go into darkness.  It requires faith in God to endure the  tribulations through which the  Saints are called to pass  and to believe that all things  will be fulfilled spoken of by the  Prophets. There are tens of thous-  ands who know that this is the work  of God. There is no power beneath  the heavens that can prevent the  purposes of God being accomplished;  What is the matter with the world  and the cause of its opposition to  this work? It simply arises from  the fact that God has set His hand  to build up His kingdom and that is  the reason why the ministers of re-  ligion and others fight it as they  have done from the beginning. He  then testified to the good counsel  that Joseph Smith and Brigham  Young had always given to him and  to others. He testified that neither  President Young nor any of the  leaders of the people had  anything to do in the massacre  at Mountain Meadows, but he heard  the report of John D. Lee who  never intimated that he had taken  any part in the dreadful deed, and  he also heard President Young con-  demn the act and express deep sor-  row that so much innocent blood  had been shed in this Territory. The  Elders of Israel have never been in-  structed to take life or the property  of others but to become saviors of  men upon Mount Zion, and they   had never been counseled to do any  act which would not bear the light  of heaven and the records of the  earth.    Elder Woodruff spoke of the pow-  er and influence of tradition with  which so many of our people have  had to contend. The God of heaven  looks to the Elders of this people to  aid and assist Him in carrying out  his purposes. The Elders should be  awake to the responsibilities that  rest upon them at the present time.  He referred to many of the sayings  of the Prophet Joseph and the reve-  lations that came through him. If  we did not build up this kingdom  we should be rejected ourselves. He  had no doubt about the ultimate  triumph of this work, neither had  he any doubt about the fulfillment  of these revelations that God has  given through His servants in these  days. He spoke of the new birth of  all who embrace the Gospel, which  takes away the fear of death. He   also related a few incidents in his  own experience. The work that the  Elders of this church are called to  perform is such that if faithfully  done, will entitle them to glory,   honor and immortality in the world  to come.    He then spoke with regret of the  course our Government is now tak-  ing in sowing seeds that will bring a  harvest of trouble, and if they did  not repent, they would reap anguish  and death. Referring to the in-  crease of evil in the world, he said  he was 20 years old before there ever  was a murder committed in the   State where he was born, and now  every daily paper teems with the re-  cital of every kind of evil commit-  ted in the land. He exhorted all to  faithfulness, and prayed that the  Spirit of God may be with the  Elders of Israel during the Confer-  ence. 
 GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT WIL-  FORD WOODRUFF  addressed the conference in sub-  stance as follows:    I have been suffering for some  days with a cold, which almost dis-  ables me from public speaking, yet  I will try to make a few remarks   upon this important occasion. In  my view there never before was a   time when all the powers of heaven,   earth and hell were working in their  respective spheres as hard as they  are now for the advancement of the  purposes of God. The Lord has la-  bored from the creation to lead  men to do good and to obey such  laws as would result in good to  mankind. Whatever leads to good,  we are told, is of God, and whatever  leads to evil is of an opposite source.  As a people we understand some-  what the nature of the warfare ne-  cessary in the carrying on of this  work. We cannot expect any less  opposition than has been shown to  the work of God in past ages.  There has always seemed to   be a determination on the  part of the powers of darkness  to frustrate the purposes of God.  This has been especially the case in  this age. We know that God has  again revealed His will and estab-  lished His Kingdom. John the   Revelator foretold the flying of an  angel through the midst of heaven  having the everlasting Gospel.  Many declarations of Scripture  point to the restoration of the Gos-  pel in these the last days.    We have gathered in these val-  leys, perhaps 175,000 Saints from all  parts of the world, and from vari-  ous occupations. The weak things  of the world have been chosen to  bear the Priesthood, and testify to  the restoration of the Gospel. Those  who have listened to and obeyed   their messages have received the  Holy Ghost, and have been led to  gather. If this message had not  been from God, the people who em-  braced it would not have gathered,   and Utah would have still been a  bearen desert. Since the Saints  gathered they have had the same  trials and temptations which the  Saints in all ages have had to con-  tend with. The hosts of evil spir-  its who were cast down out of  heaven, are warring against the  Saints and all good men.    We have different organizations  of our youth for their proper spirit-  ual training. There are the Pri-  maries, where the little children are  taught truths of the Gospel; also the  Sabbath schools, which embrace   60,000 children. Thank God there  are so many. From these the youth  progress and become members of  the Mutual Improvement Associa-  tions.    I regard the work awaiting the   youth of this people as equal in im-  portance to that which ever lay be-  fore a class of young men and  women on earth. It rests upon   them to take the kingdom of God  and bear it forth; to stand in the   midst of the judgments which are  coming upon the earth. I regard  the present generation as lying in as  deep darkness as any that ever lived  upon the earth. A thousand mur-  ders are committed now where there  was one seventy or eighty years ago.    The Kingdom of God, its keys  and Priesthood, are here, and I  want to say to my young brethren  who are present: Lead your fellows   from that which is evil, and lay   aside everything which corrupts  either mind or body. No man can  inherit a kingdom of glory without  abiding the law of that kingdom,  and we are all aiming, or should be,  for a celestial kingdom.    Nine out of ten of the young   missionaries now being sent abroad  are chosen from the Mutual Im-  provement Associations. The mem-  bers of these organizations are pre-  paring themselves for the ministry.  In company with some of my  brethren I have the honor to be as-  sociated with these institutions, but I  have not much time to spend with  them.    In 1844 about 7000 persons were  baptized in England; but now the  labors of our missionaries are like  gathering grapes after the vintage is  done. If an Elder, during a mis-  sion of two or three years, baptizes  half a dozen or a dozen persons, he   thinks he has done a good work; and  he has.    Young men, leave grog shops  alone; avoid everything that is  evil; remember that you have a law  to obey and never break it. Keep  the law of purity and chastity.    I pray God to help you to com-  prehend your positions, duties and   labors. I am sometimes asked why  does not God preserve His Saints  from persecution and temptation?  God has His own way to deal with  men. In no age has He kept His  people from contact with persecu-  tion and temptation. We have to  meet these things; therefore prepare  yourselves for them.    I ask God to bless you all, to guide   you and preserve you, in the name   of Jesus. Amen. 
 selves, and all books, documents, and  papers appertaining to the office of the  recorder, likewise the library with all  the books, maps, instruments, etc., that  may belong thereto. We also present  before thee, for thine acceptance, all the  additions and buildings not forming a  part of the main edifice, but being ap-  pendages thereto; and we pray thee to  bless all the furniture, seats, cushions,  curtains, hangings, locks and fastenings  and multitudinous other appliances and  appurtenances found in and belonging  to this Temple and its annexes, with all  the work of ornamentation thereon, the  painting and plastering, the gilding and  bronzing, the fine work in wood and  metal of every kind, the embroidery  and needlework, the pictures and stat-  uary, the carved work and canopies.   Also the materials of which the build-  ings and their contents are made or   composed—the rock, lime, mortar and  plaster, the timbers and lath, the wood  of various trees, the gold and silver, the  brass and iron, and all other metals, the  silk, wool, and cotton, the skins and  furs, the glass, china and precious stones,  all these and all else herein we humbly  present for thine acceptance and sancti-  fying blessing.    Our Father in heaven, we present  before thee the altars which we have   prepared for thy servants and hand-  maidens to receive their sealing bless-  ings. We dedicate them in the name of  the Lord Jesus Christ, unto thy most  holy name, and we ask thee to sanctify  these altars that those who come unto  them may feel the power of the Holy  Ghost resting upon them, and realize  the sacredness of the covenants they  enter into. And we pray that our cove-  nants and contracts which we make with  thee and with each other may be di-  rected by thy Holy Spirit, be sacredly  kept by us, and accepted by thee, and  that all the blessings pronounced may  be realized, by all thy Saints who come  to these altars, in the morning of the  resurrection of the just.    O Lord, we pray thee to bless and  sanctify the whole of this block or piece   of ground on which these buildings  stand, with the surrounding walls and  fences, the walks, paths, and ornamental  beds, also the trees, plants, flowers and   shrubbery that grow in its soil; may  they bloom and blossom and become  exceedingly beautiful and fragrant; and  may thy Spirit dwell in the midst thereof,  that this plot of ground may be a place  of rest and peace, for holy meditation  and inspired thought.    Preserve these buildings, we beseech  thee, from injury or destruction by flood   or fire; from the rage of the elements,  the shafts of the vivid lightning, the  overwhelming blasts of the hurricane,  the flames of consuming fire, and the  upheavals of the earthquake, O Lord,  protect them.    Bless, we pray thee, Heavenly Father,   all who may be workers in this house.  Remember continually thy servant who  shall be appointed to preside within its  wall, endow him richly with the wisdom  of the Holy Ones, with the spirit of his  calling, with the power of his Priest-  hood, and with the gift of discernment.  Bless, according to their calling, his  assistants and all who are associated  with him in the performance of the   ordinances,—baptisms, confirmations,  washings, anointings, sealings, endow-  ments, and ordinations which are per-  formed herein, that all that is done may  be holy and acceptable unto thee, thou  God of our salvation. Bless the record-  ers and copyists, that the records of the  Temple may be kept perfect, and with-  out omissions and errors, and that they  may also be accepted of thee. Bless, in  their several positions, the engineers,  watchmen, guards, and all others who  have duties to perform in connection  with the house, that they may perform  them unto thee with an eye single to thy  glory.    Remember also in thy mercy all those  who have labored in the erection of this  house, or who have, in any way, by their  means or influence aided in its comple-  tion; may they in no wise lose their  reward.    O thou God of our fathers Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob, whose God thou de-  lightest to be called, we thank thee with  all the fervor of overflowing gratitude  that thou hast revealed the powers by  which the hearts of the children are  being turned to their fathers and the  hearts of the fathers to the children,  that the sons of men in all their genera-  tions can be made partakers of the  glories and joys of the kingdom of  heaven. Confirm upon us the spirit of  Elijah, we pray thee, that we may thus  redeem our dead and also connect our-  selves with our fathers who have passed  behind the veil, and furthermore seal up  our dead to come forth in the first resur-  rection that we who dwell on earth may  be bound to those who dwell in heaven.   We thank thee for their sake who have  finished their work in mortality, as well  for our own, that the prison doors have  been opened, that deliverance has been  proclaimed to the captive, and the bonds  have been loosened from those who were  bound. We praise thee that our fathers,  from last to first, from now back to the   beginning, can be united with us in  indissoluble links, welded by the holy  Priesthood, and that as one great family  united in thee and cemented by thy  power we shall together stand before  thee, and by the power of the atoning  blood of thy Son be delivered from all  evil, be saved and sanctified, exalted  and glorified. Wilt thou also permit  holy messengers to visit us within these  sacred walls and make known unto us  with regard to the work we should per-  form in behalf of our dead. And, as   thou hast inclined the hearts of many  who have not yet entered into covenant  with thee to search out their progenitors  and in so doing they have traced the  ancestry of many of thy Saints, we pray  thee, that thou wilt increase this desire  in their bosoms, that they may in  this way aid in the accomplishment of  thy work. Bless them, we pray thee, in  their labors, that they may not fall into   errors in preparing their genealogies;  and furthermore, we ask thee to open  before them new avenues of information,  and place in their hands the records of   the past, that their work may not only  be correct but complete also.    O thou Great Father of the spirits of  all flesh, graciously bless and fully  qualify those upon whom thou hast  placed a portion of thine authority and  who bear the responsibilities and powers  of the Priesthood which is after the  order of thy Son. Bless them all from  first to last, from thy servant who repre-  sents thee in all the world to the latest  who has been ordained to the Deacon's  office. Upon each and all confer the  spirit of their calling, with a compre-  hension of its duties and a loving zeal to  fulfil them. Endow them with faith,  patience and understanding. May their   lives be strong in virtue and adorned  with humility; may their ministrations  be effectual, their prayers be availing  and their teachings the path of salvation.  May they be united by the Spirit and   power of God in all their labors, and in  every thought, word and act may they  glorify thy name and vindicate the wis-  dom that has made them kings and  priests unto thee.    For thy servants of the First Presi-  dency of the Church we first of all pray.  Reveal, in great clearness, thy mind and  will unto them in all things essential for  the welfare of thy people; give them  heavenly wisdom, abounding faith and  the power and gifts necessary to enable  them to preside acceptably unto thee  over the officers and members of thy  Church. Remember in love thy servant  whom thou has called to be a Prophet,  Seer and Revelator to all mankind, whose  days have been many upon the earth;  yet lengthen out his span of mortal life,  we pray thee, and grant unto him all the  powers and gifts, in their completeness,  of the office thou hast conferred upon  him; and in like manner bless his asso-  ciates in the Presidency of thy Church.    Confer upon thy servants the, Twelve  Apostles, a rich endowment of thy  Spirit. Under their guidance may  the Gospel of the kingdom go forth into   all the world, to be preached to all  nations, kindreds, tongues, and people,  that the honest in heart in every land  may hear the glad tidings of joy and  salvation. Overrule, we pray thee, in  the midst of the governments of the  earth, that the barriers that now stand  in the way of the spread of thy truths   may be removed, and liberty of con-  science be accorded to all peoples.    Remember in loving kindness thy  servants, the Patriarchs. May they be  full of blessings for thy people Israel.  May they bear with them the seeds of  comfort and consolation, of encourage-  ment and blessing. Fill them with the  Holy Spirit of promise, and be gracious-  ly pleased to fulfill their words of  prophecy, that thy name may be extolled  by the people of thy Church and their  faith in thee and in the promises of thy  ministering servants be increasingly  strengthened.    With thy servants of the Twelve,   bless their associates the Seventies;  may they be powerful in the preaching of  thy word and in bearing it to the four  quarters of the earth. May an ever-  widening way be opened before them  until they shall have raised the Gospel  standard in every land and proclaimed  its saving truths in every tongue, that all  [t]he islands and the continents may re-  joice in the testimony of the great work  thou art in these latter days performing  on the earth.    Bless abundantly, O Lord, the High   Priests in all the varied duties and posi-  tions to which thou hast called them. As  standing ministers of thy word in the  multiplying Stakes of Zion, wilt thou  endow them richly with the spirit of  their exalted callings. As Presidents,  Counselors, Bishops, members of High  Councils, and in every other office  which their Priesthood gives them the  right to fill, may they be righteous  ministers of thy holy law, loving fathers  of the people, and as judges in the midst  of the Saints may they deal out just and  impartial judgment tempered with mercy  and love.    So also, in their various callings, con-  fer precious gifts of wisdom, faith and  knowledge upon thy servants the Elders, 
 Sept 13th [188]7.    Elder Lot Smith  Mormon Dairy, Yavapai Co. A. T.    Dear Brother:    I received your letter of August 25th, which I read  with much interest.    Now Brother Lot, when you get this I want you to sit  down and answer me the following questions: Give me  the names of the committee who settled with you. Have  you got through with the settlement? What has it left you?  Do you own the Dairy or any of it? If so, how much?  Do you own the spring at the dairy? If you own half of it,   who owns the best? How many Horses, Cattle and   Sheep have you left? After the settlement how is your  family? Where do you live? What is the name of your  Post office? 
 Priests, Teachers, and Deacons, that all  may diligently perform their part in the  glorious labors thou hast called thy  Priesthood to bear.    Forget not, we beseech thee, thy ser-  vants the missionaries, who are pro-  claiming the saving truths that thou hast  revealed for man's redemption to the   millions who are now overshadowed by  deep spiritual darkness. Preserve them  from all evil, deliver them from mob  violence, may they want no good thing,  but be greatly blessed with the gifts and  powers of their ministry. Remember  also their families that they may be  sustained and comforted by thee and be  cherished and cared for by thy Saints.    We pray thee for the members of thy  holy Church throughout all the world,  that thy people may be so guided and  governed of thee, that all who profess  to be and call themselves Saints may be  preserved in the unity of the faith, in  the way of truth, in the bonds of peace  and in holiness of life. Strengthen the  weak, we pray thee, and impart thy  Spirit unto all.    Our Father, may peace abide in all  the homes of thy Saints; may holy  angels guard them; may they be encom-  passed by thine arms of love; may  prosperity shine upon them, and may  the tempter and the destroyer be re-  moved far from them. May the days of  thy covenant people be lengthened out  in righteousness, and sickness and dis-  ease be rebuked from their midst. May  the land they inhabit be made fruitful by  thy grace; may its waters be increased  and the climate be tempered to the com-  fort and need of thy people; may  drought, devastating storms, cyclones,  and hurricanes be kept afar off, and  earthquakes never disturb the land  which thou hast given us. May locusts,  caterpillars and other insects not de-  stroy our gardens and desolate our  fields; but may we be a people blessed  of thee in our bodies and spirits, in our  homes and habitations, in our flocks  and herds, in ourselves and our posterity,  and in all that thou hast made us stew-  ards over.    Now pray we for the youth of Zion—  the children of thy people; endow them  richly with the spirit of faith and   righteousness and with increasing love  for thee and for thy law. Prosper all the  institutions that thou hast established in   our midst for their well-being. Give to  our Church schools an ever-increasing  power for good. May thy Holy Spirit  dominate the teachings given therein  and also control the hearts and illumine  the minds of the students. Bless mar-  velously thy servants, the General  Superintendent, and all the principals,  teachers and other officers, and also those  who form the General Board of Education  of thy Church. Remember likewise in  thy loving kindness the Sunday schools,  with all who, either as teachers or schol-  ars, belong thereto; may the influence of  the instruction given therein broaden  and deepen, to thy glory and the salva-  tion of thy children, until the perfect  day. Bless the members of the General  Board of the Deseret Sunday School  Union with the wisdom necessary for  the proper fulfillment of their duties and  for the accomplishment of the purposes  for which this board was created.    We also uphold before thee the Young  Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual Im-  provement associations, with all their  officers, general and local, and the   members. May they be prospered of  thee, their membership be enlarged and   the good that they accomplish increase  with every succeeding year. For the  Primaries and Religion classes we also   seek thy constant blessing and guiding   care; may the spirit of instruction be  poured out upon the presidents and  associate officers and teachers. May  they keep pace with the rest of the edu-  cational establishments in thy Church,  so that from their earliest years our  children may be diligently brought up in  the ways of the Lord, and thy name be  magnified in their growth in virtue and  intelligence.    Nor would we forget, O Lord, the  normal training classes among the peo-  ple, whether these classes be connected  with the Church schools, the Improve-  ment associations or the Sunday  schools. Grant that these classes may  be the means of spreading true educa-  tion throughout all the borders of the  Saints by the creation of a body of  teachers who will not only be possessed  of rare intelligence but be filled also  with the spirit of the Gospel, and be  powerful in the testimony of thy truth  and in implanting a love for thee and for  thy works in the hearts of all whom  they instruct.    We would hold up before thee, O  Lord, the Relief Societies with all their  members; and all those who preside in  their midst according to their callings  and appointments, general or local.  Bless the teachers in their labors of   mercy and charity, who, as ministering  angels, visit the homes of the sick and  the needy, bearing succor, consolation  and comfort to the unfortuate and sor-  rowful. And bless, we beseech thee,  most merciful Father, the poor of thy  people, that the cry of want and suffer-  ing may not ascend unto thee from the   midst of thy Saints whom thou hast  blessed so abundantly with the comforts  of this world. Open up new avenues  by which the needy can obtain a liveli-  hood by honest industry, and also in-  cline the hearts of those blessed more  abundantly, to give generously of their  substance to their, in this respect, less  favored brethren and sisters, that thou  mayest not have reason to chide us  for the neglect of even the least among  thy covenant children.    O God of Israel, turn thy face, we  pray thee, in loving kindness toward  thy stricken people of the House of  Judah. Oh, deliver them from those  that oppress them. Heal up their  wounds, comfort their hearts, strengthen  their feet, and give them ministers after  thine own heart who shall lead them as  of old, in thy way. May the days of  their tribulation soon cease, and they be  planted by thee in the valleys and plains  of their ancient home; and may Jerusa-  lem rejoice and Judea be glad for the   multitude of her sons and daughters, for  the sweet voices of children in her  streets, and the rich outpouring of thy  saving mercies upon them. May Israel  no more bow the head, or bend the neck  to the oppressor, but may his feet be  made strong on the everlasting hills,   never more, by violence, to be banished  therefrom, and the praise and the glory  shall be thine.    Remember in like pity the dwindling  remnants of the House of Israel, de-  scendants of thy servant Lehi. Restore  them, we pray thee, to thine ancient  favor, fulfill in their completeness the  promises given to their fathers, and  make of them a white and delightsome  race, a loved and holy people as in  former days. May the time also be nigh  at hand when thou wilt gather the dis-  persed of Israel from the islands of the  sea and from every land in which thou  hast scattered them, and the ten tribes  of Jacob from their hiding place in the  north, and restore them to communion  and fellowship with their kinsmen of  the seed of Abraham.    We thank thee, O God of Israel, that  thou didst raise up patriotic men to lay  the foundation of this great American  government. Thou didst inspire them  to frame a good Constitution and laws  which guarantee to all of the inhabitants  of the land equal rights and privileges to  worship thee according to the dictates of  their own consciences. Bless the offi-  cers, both judicial and executive. Con-  fer abundant favors upon the President,  his Cabinet, and Congress. Enlightened  and guided by thy Spirit, may they main-  tain and uphold the glorious principles  of human liberty. Our hearts are filled  with gratitude to thee, our Father in  heaven, for thy kindness unto us in  softening the hearts of our fellow citi-  zens, the people of this nation, towards  us. That which thou hast done has  been marvelous in our eyes. We thank  thee that thou didst move upon the  heart of our President to issue a general  amnesty; that thou hast removed  prejudice and misunderstanding from  the minds of many of the people con-  cerning us and our purposes, and they  are disposed to treat us as fellow  citizens, and not as enemies. In this  holy house we feel to give thee glory  therefor, and we humbly ask thee to  increase this feeling in their hearts.  Enable them to see us in our true light.  Show unto them that we are their friends  that we love liberty, that we will join  with them in upholding the rights of the  people, the Constitution and laws of our  country; and give unto us and our  children an increased disposition to al-  ways be loyal, and to do everything in  our power to maintain constitutional  rights and the freedom of all within the  confines of this great Republic.    Remember in mercy, O Lord, the  kings, the princes, the nobles, the rulers  and governors, and the great ones of the   earth, and likewise all the poor, the  afflicted and the oppressed, and indeed,  all people, that their hearts may be  softened when thy servants go forth to  bear testimony of thy name, that their  prejudices may give way before the  truth, and thy people find favor in their  eyes. So control the affairs of the na-  tions of the earth, that the way may be  prepared for the ushering in of a reign  of righteousness and truth. We desire  to see liberty spread throughout the  earth, to see oppression cease, the yoke  of the tyrant broken, and every des-  potic form of government overthrown  by which thy children are degraded and  crushed, and prevented from enjoying  their share of the blessings of the earth,   which thou hast created for their habi-  tation.    O God, the Eternal Father, thou  knowest all things. Thou seest the  course thy people have been led to take  in political matters. They have, in many  instances, joined the two great national  parties. Campaigns have been entered  upon, elections have been held, and  much party feeling has been engendered.  Many things have been said and done  which have wounded the feelings of the  humble and the meek, and which have  been a cause of offense. We beseech  thee, in thine infinite mercy and good-  ness, to forgive thy people wherein they

 have sinned in this direction. Show   them, O Father, their faults and their  errors, that they may see the same in the  light of thy Holy Spirit, and repent  truly and sincerely, and cultivate that  spirit of affection and love which thou  art desirous that all the children of men  should entertain one for another, and  which thy Saints, above all others,  should cherish. Enable thy people  hereafter to avoid bitterness and strife,  and to refrain from words and acts in   political discussions that shall create  feeling and grieve thy Holy Spirit.    Heavenly Father, when thy people   shall not have the opportunity of enter-  ing this holy house to offer their suppli-  cations unto thee, and they are op-  pressed and in trouble, surrounded by  difficulties or assailed by temptation,  and shall turn their faces towards this  thy holy house and ask thee for deliver-  ance, for help, for thy power to be ex-  tended in their behalf, we beseech thee   to look down from thy holy habitation  in mercy and tender compassion upon  them, and listen to their cries. Or  when the children of thy people, in  years to come, shall be separated,  through any cause, from this place, and  their hearts shall turn in remembrance   of thy promises to this holy Temple,  and they shall cry unto thee from the  depths of their affliction and sorrow to  extend relief and deliverance to them,  we humbly entreat thee to turn thine ear  in mercy to them; hearken to their cries,  and grant unto them the blessings for  which they ask.    Almighty Father, increase within us  the powers of that faith delivered to  and possessed by thy Saints. Strengthen  us by the memories of the glorious de-  liverances of the past, by the remem-  brance of the sacred covenants that thou  hast made with us, so that, when evil  overshadows us, when trouble encom-  passes us, when we pass through the  valley of humiliation, we may not falter,  may not doubt, but in the strength of  thy holy name may accomplish all thy  righteous purposes with regard to us,  fi[l]l the measure of our creation, and  triumph gloriously, by thy grace, over  every besetting sin, be redeemed from  every evil, and be numbered in the  kingdom of heaven amongst those who  shall dwell in thy presence forever.    And now, our Father, we bless thee,   we praise thee, we glorify thee, we  worship thee, day by day we magnify  thee, and give thee thanks for thy great  goodness towards us thy children, and  we pray thee in the name of thy Son  Jesus Christ, our Savior, to hear these  our humble petitions, and answer us  from heaven, thy holy dwelling place,   where thou sittest enthroned in glory,  might, majesty, and dominion, and with  an infinitude of power which we, thy  mortal creatures, cannot imagine, much  less comprehend. Amen and Amen. 
 My health is pretty good, but I am somewhat   busy these days. Give my love to your family.  I would like to know how your health is. I have  one of your old companions with me who drives me  out nights where I go and guards &c—Brother Samuel  Bateman—and he wants the remembered to you.    Brother Lot, you have some friends left, George   Q. Cannon, Joseph F. Smith and W. Woodruff and many  others are your friends and dont feel disposed to  kill you yet and all wish to be remembered.    I pray God to bless you and your family.    I remain    Your friend and brother    WLewis Allen 
 W. WOODRUFF  AUTOBIOGRPAHY    VOL.  2. 
 W. Woodruff's  Autobiography. 
 Eighteen hundred and forty four entered with a  cold blustering snow storm. I spent the day plastering  and white washing the Printing Office  On the 3rd a Court of Inquiry was  held at Joseph's Store concerning William and Wilson Law  and William Marks. William Law proffessed to  beleive that Joseph had instructed the police to kill him  but the pact was thus the Law's had turned traitors  and were in reality seeking the life of Joseph by brewing  mischief. A second court was held on the 5th upon  the same matter    On the 7th Mrs Woodruff and  myself met with the quorum and we had an interesting  time of instruction. I spoke during the day upon  the relationships which we sustain to our posterity and  progenitures in the resurrection. We returned home  and offered up prayers for the salvation of our friends  and retired to rest.    During the month of January Elder Taylor 
 receive a portion of knowledge from God by immediate revelation  by Same Source we can receive all knowledge    That shall I talk about to day? [I know]  what brother[Cahoon] wants about me to the. He wants me to [speak]  about the coming of Elijah in the [Last] days. I can see  it in his [eye]. I will speak upon that subject they    The Bible says I will send you Elijah  before the great and terrible day of the God come that [I]  shall [turn] the [hearts] of the [children] fathers to the children and  the hearts of the children to their fathers [lest] I come and  smite the earth with a curse. Now the word "turn"  here should be translated bind or [soul].    But what is the object of this important  mission or how is it to be fulfilled. The [keys] are to  be [delivered] the [Spirit] of [Elijah] is to come the Gospel  to be established the Saints of God gathered Zion [built]  up and the Saints to [come] up as Saviours[ and [illegible] Zion]    But how are they to become Saviours on Mount Zion? By building their Temples [erecting]  their baptismal fonts and going forth and [receiving]  all the ordinances baptisms confirmations washings  [illegible] ordinations and Sealing Powers upon our  heads in behalf of all our Progenitors who are dead  and redeem them that they may come forth in the  first resurrection and be [illegible] to [illegible] of  glory with us    [illegible] is the chain which binds  the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children  to the fathers which fulfills the mission of Elijah  I would to God that this Temple was now done  that we might go with it and go to work and  improve our time and make use of the seeds while  they are on earth. The Saints [illegible] none too 
 much time to same and redeem their dead and gather  together their living relatives that they may be saved  also before the earth will be smitten and the [conchemmation]  decreed falls upon the world    I would advise all the Saints to go  to with all their might and gather together all their living  relatives to this place that they may be sealed and   saved that they may be prepared against the day when  the Destroying Angelgoes forth    If the whole church should go to  with all their might to save their dead, seal their  posterity and gather their living friends and spend  none of their time in behalf of the world they  would hardly get through when Night would come  when no man could work    My only trouble at the present  time is concerning ourselves—that the Saints will  be divided and broken up and scattered before we  get our salvation secure; for their are so manyfools  in the world for the Dead to operate upon it gives  him the advantageof ten times    The question is frequently asked  Can we not be saved without going through with  all these ordinances? I would answer no; not  with the fulness of salvation    Jesus said there were many  mansions in his Fathers Kingdom and he would  go and prepare a place for them. ('House" in the  [tess] should have been translated kingdom}. Any  person who is called to the had to  abide a celestial law and the whole law too; but  here has been a great diffuculty in getting anything  into the hearts of this Generation. It has been 
 srlike splitting hemlock knetts with a corn dogger for a wedge  and a pumpkin for a beltte. Ran the Saints are show to   understand. I have tried for a number of years to prepare  the minds of the Saints to receive the things of God; but  we frequently see some of them after suffering all they have  for the work of God fly to pieces like glassas seen as anything  comes that is contrary to their traditions. They cant stand  the fire at all. How many will be able to abide a  celestial law and go through and recieve their exaltation  I am unable to say; but many are called and few  are chosen."    On the 15th I met with the quorum of the Twelve   at the house of President Young. Orson Hyde who had  not been with us for some time was presentand received  his    Last evening I again met with them  at the same place and Orson Prattrecieved his    On the evening following we met at  Joseph's Store. There were a number of prayers &  exhortations upon the subject of holiness of heart  Willard Richards and his wife Janette received their  and Sealing    Next day was Sundaythe 28th and  in the evening I met quorum of the Twelve &  others for instruction and endowment. The subject of  Olijah's coming to seal the hearts of the Fathers to the   children was spoken of; and    Wilford and Phebe Woodruff received their   and Sealings 
 Two evenings later at the house of President Young   John and Leonora Taylor received thier  and Sealing. On the next George A Smith and  sister Smith received their and  sealing and two evenings after W. H. [Phelp] and   wife reveived theirs.    There was at this time quite a  revival throughout Nauvoo and an enquiring after  the things of God by all the quorums ofthe Church  generally    Joseph's Dream    In the Office of the Prophet on the 3rd of  Feb I wasconversing with Willard Richards when  Joseph came in with W. W. Phelps and he related  to us the following dream    "I was standing on a peninsula in  the midst of a large body of water when there appeared  to be a large [barbour] or a pier built out for boats  to come into. I was surrounded by my friends   and while looking at this barbour I saw a steam-  boat approaching it. There were bridges on the   pier for persons to cross and there came up a wind  and 
 But it was not long before I saw them starting out into the  channel or main body of water again. The storms were  raging and the waters rough. I said to my friends that  if they did not understand the signs and the times and  the spirit of prophecy they would be apt to be lost. It was  but a few moments after when we saw the waves break  over the boat and she soon foundered and went down  with all on board and perished    The storm amd waters were stil   very rough; yet I told my friends around me that  I beleived I could stay those waves and storm and  swim in the waters better than the steam boat  did and that at any rate I was determined to try  it. But my freinds laughed at me and told   me that I could not stand the storm at all  but should be drowned.    The waters looked clear and   beautiful though exceedingly rough and I said that   I beleived I could swim and that I would try it  anyhow. They said I should drown. I answered  that I would have a frolic on the water first if  I   did and I drove dived off into the raging waves. I had  swam but but a short distance when a towering wave  overwhelmed me for a time but I soon found myself  upon the top of it. I met the second wave in  the same way and for a while I struggled hard to   live in the midst of the storm and waves; but I   soon found that I gained upon every wave and stemmed  the torrent better and better. I soon had power  to swim with my head out of water so the waves  did not break over me at all and I found that I   swam a great distance. In looking about  me I saw my brother Samuel by my side 
 I asked him how he liked it and he said first rate and   I thought so too. I was soon enabled to swim with   my head and shoulders out of water and I could swim  as fast as any steamboat. In a little time it   became calm and I could rush through the water only  going in up to my loins. Soon I only went in up  to my knees and finally I could tread upon the top   of the water and went almost with the speed of an arrow  I said to Samuel se[e] how swift I can go and thought   it was great pleasure to travel with such speed   and I awoke."    I continued to meet from time to time  with my quorum for the giving of the [redacted]  ]redacted].    Why Joseph was candidate for the   Presidential Chair    A congregation of the citizens met in the room over   Joseph's store to hear his view upon the affairs  of government which had been written and was   read by W. W. Phelps.    Joseph gave his reasons  for permitting his name to go forth as a candidate   for the presidency of the United States. He said    "I would not have suffered my   name to have been used by my friends or anywise  as President of the United States or candidate for   that office if I and my friends could have had   the privilege of enjoying our religions and civil rights   as American citizens even those rights which 
 the Constitution guarantee unto all her citizens alike. But  this we as a people have been denied from the beginning  Persecution has rolled upon our heads from time to time  from portions of the United States like peels of thunder  because of our religion and no portion of the Government  as yet has steped forward for our relief and under  view of these things I feel it to be my right and  privilege to obtain what influence and power I can lawfully  in the United States for the protection of injured  inocence and if I loose my life in a good cause I  am willing to be sacrificed on the alter of virtue righteousness  and truth in maintaining the laws and Constitution of  the United States if need be for the general good of  mankind."    Many other interesting remarks were  made. He was followed by Elders Hyde and Taylor  and a unanimous vote was passed by the assembly   to support Joseph.    On the 20th I met in Council  in the morning with the Presidency and Twelve. Two  messengers arrived from the Pine County with word  from Lyman Wight wanting counsel concerning preaching  to the Indians. Joseph thought it wisdom not  to do it and said that if Lyman Wight did it  he must do it upon his own responsibility and concluded  not to send him any counsel but to let him act  with the best wisdom he had.    Next day I again On the 21st of Feb met with the  quorum of the Twelve at Joseph's store and according  to Joseph's counsel we sellected a company to go  on an exploring expedition to California and select  a spot to build a city. Jonathan Dunham  David Fulmer Phineas Young Alphonzo Young 
 and Elders Yerslay Emmett were named for that expedition    While we were holding this council the Rev  D. Wolfe an Episcopalian clergyman was preaching to  a congregation of Saints in the other room. When  he closed President Joseph Smith followed and among  other remarks he said    "Men may preach and practice everything  excepting that which God commands us to do and they  will be damned at last. We may tithe our 'rue'  'annis' and 'commin' and still not obey the commandments  of God. The object with me is to obey and teach  others to obey God in just what He tells us to  do. It mattereth not whether the principle is popular  or unpopular I will always maintain a true  principle even if I stand alone in it."    On the evening of Sunday the 25  I met with the quorum and had an interesting time  We had received information concerning the death of  Joseph Duncon and Governor Reynolds of Missouri  who shot himself through the head. They were  two of the most inveterate enemies against the  Latter-day Saints. This called forth    A Notable Prophecy of Joseph    He prophesied that within five years we should  be rid of our old enemies whether they were apostates  or of the world and wished us to record it that  when it came to pass we need not say we had   forgotton his saying    By special appointment a large   assembly of Saints met on Thursday the 7th of March  for the purpose of announcing the progress of the 
 Temple &c The quorum of the Twelve and Temple Committe  were present with about seven or eight-thousand Saints    Hymns were sung and prayer offered up by  Parley P. Pratt and then Elder Young arose and observed that  the Patriarch was next and Hyrum came to the stand and  spoke to the assembly. He said    The object of this meeting is to stir  up your minds by way of remembrance  It is necessary  to have a starting point to build the Temple. With the  assistance of the sisters we expect to get the nails and  glass and with the assistance of the brethren we intend  to do the rest. I will proclaim in public and private  that the sisters bought the glass and nails by penny  subscription. Choose ye this day whom ye  will serve!    We shall call upon this vast  multitude for a donation to buy powder and fuse rope  to blast the rocks in the quarry. We want the  brethren to do as much as the sisters. We do  not intend to finish the Nauvoo House this  season but to finish the Temple or the walls  of it this Summer get the roof on by December  and do the inside next winter and in about a  year from this Spring we will dedicate it  We can do anything we undertake We have  power and we can do great things    In five years to come the work  will progress more than it has in ten years of the   past. Isaiah said we should perform a marvellous  work and a wonder. I do not marvel that he  said so if he saw this vast multitude and I  think this people are abundantly able to build  this Temple and much depends upon it. Our 
 endowments and sealing powers and many blessings depend  upon it."    The Prophet arrived and took the stand  and arose in the midst of the congregation and said  "Orson Pratt come and take your place" and  then continued:    "I do not know whether the object of  the meeting has been told or not. I apologize for  not coming sooner.    I have had so much on my  mind since I saw you that I hardly know where  to begin; but one of the grand objects which I had  in view in calling this meeting was to make a  few remarks relative to the laws and ordinances  and the building of the Temple    The reason I want to speak of  the laws is that the officers have difficulties in  administering the laws. We are republican and  wish to have the people rule but rule in righteousness  Some would complain with what God Himself would  do. The laws are enacted by petition and they  can be repealed if they wish it but the people  ought not to complain of the officers but complain  of the lawmakers    I am instructed by the City  Council to tell this people that if you do not like  any law which we have passed we will repeal it  for we are your servants. If any complain of  our rights and charters it is because they are wicked  The Devil is in them.    The reason I call this up is  we have a simple gang fellews who do not  know where their head or elbows are. If you preach 
 virtue to them they will oppose it. If you preach the Methodist  God to them they will oppose that also or anything else and  if there is any case tried they want it appealed to Carthage  Mr Boswicks case had to go there. Our lawyers will  send anything to Carthage    I want to know if the citizens will  sustain me when my hands are raised to heaven for the  people. I will arraign the person before the people  who acts against the interest of the city and I shall have  the voice of the people which is republican and is likely  to be the voice of God    As long as I have a tongue to speak  I will expose the iniquity of the lawyers and wicked  men. I fear not their boiling over nor the boiling over  of Hell nor its thunders and forked lightning.    I despise the man who will betray   you with a kiss. Here is Hyrum Kimball. He has  set at naught the ordinances of the city by saying that  he owns the warf, and steamboats need not pay them.  Wherefore? This body is the highest court. What  appeal to Carthage? I would not appeal there if I  died a thousand deaths. Neither Kimball nor  Morrison owns the warfage. Water street runs  along the beach and belongs to the city and not individuals    I will reprove the lawyers and  doctors. Jesus did and every prophet has and if   I am a prophet I shall also do it. At any rate  I shall do it for I profess to be a Prophet    The laws and Constitution of the   United States have ceded the right to corporated cities   to regulate all warfage of shiping and steamboats &c  All laws of taxation are subject to the city and not   to individuals; and I want from this time forth 
 every fool to stay at home and let the steamboats and  captains alone and let the peace officers alone. How can  we keep off mobs and keep inocent blood from being  shed? By striking a blow at everything which  rises up in disorder and I will wage an eternal  war with those who oppose me while I am labouring  in behalf of the city.    A man has been writing to the   New York Tribune. I will not mention his name  He says that much has been spent for other  purposes which was appropriated for the building of  the Temple; but I will pledge myself that any  man who has paid any old shoes harness or  anything else if he will come I will show him  on book that everything farth has been appropriated for  the building of the Temple.    There are many men in our  midst who are trying to build up themselves at  our expence and others who are watching for iniquity  and who will make a man an offender for a  word. But I will give way and, rest myself for  others"    President Hyrum Smith then made  some costick remarks upon the lawyers    A brother of Dr Foster threatened the  Mayor and the Mayor fined him ten dollars.    President Joseph Smith's views of the  Government was then read and he was by universal  applause nominated by the Saints as a candidate for   the Presidency of the United States. An article was  read entitled a "Voice of Inocence from Nauvoo" and  a meeting of the "Female Relief Society appointed to  attend to the issue of this article. 
 During the intermission which followed the  Twelve met with the Seventies and they passed a resolution  to build the Hall of the Seventies one story higher for the Presidency.    In the afternoon President Brigham Young addressed  the assembly. In the course of his remarks he said    "I wish to speak of the duty of lawyers classing  myself with the lawyers in the House of Israel When any man  who is a lawyer takes a course to break peace instead of making   it he is out of the way of his duty. A doctor of the law  should study the law and make peace    The grand object we have before us is to build  the Temple this season. We have had the effects of  slander and want a cure and balm. I carry one  with me all the while and I want you to do the same  I will tell you what it is. It is to mind our own  business and let others alone and suffer wrong rather  than do wrong. If any one will take your property  away let him alone and have nothing to do with  him    A spirit has been manifested to   divide the Saints. This was manifest in the last  election. It was said if they did not look out  the Saints on the flat would beat the Saints on  the hill. Great God! How such a thing  looks that the Saints should be affraid of beating  one another in the election or being beat?    I would ask who built up this  city? Would steamboats have landed here if   the Saints had not come or could speculators  have sold their lands for anything here? If the  Saints had not come they might have sold for a  few bear and wolf skins but not for money. Can  these speculators sell all their lands to the Saints 
 for a great price and then go away and enjoy it somewhere  else. I tell you nay for know it ye people that Israel  is here and that they are the head and not the tail and the  people must learn it. All those who have gone from us  have gone from the head to the tail. But if any of you  wish to know how to have your bread fall butter side up  then butter it both sides and it will fall so. Uppose  this work and it will roll over you. When did this  work ever stop since it began? Never. The only  thing the Saints now want to know is what does   the Lord want of us and we are ready to do it. Well  then build the Temple of the Lord; keep the law of  God ye Saints and the hypocrit and scoundral will   flee out of your midst and tremble for the fire of God  will be too hot for them"    Joseph the Prophet & the Presidential Chair    Elder John Taylor followed Brigham Young in an address  upon government and political matters and Joseph in an  address after said    "As to politics I care but little about  the Presidential Chair. I would not give half as much for  the office as I would for the one I now hold; but as the  world have used the power of government to oppress and  persecute us it is right for us to use it for the protection  of our rights. When I get hold of the eastern papers  and I see how popular I am, I am affraid myself that I shall  be elected; but if I should be elected I would not say your  cause is just but I cannot do anything for you 
 What I said in relation to the    Anexation of Texas    is with some unpopular. The people are opposed to it.  I will take this objection away. The opposition is because   it is filled up with slavery. Now I wish to turn the  argument. It is the very reason why they ought to be  received in order to watch over them. Of the two evils  we should reject the greatest. The President of Texas  says if you do not receive us in the United States we  will go to the British. This would certainly be bad  policy for this nation. The British are now throughout  the whole country trying to bribe all they can. How  much better it is to be to a little expence than to have  the Indians and British upon us. We should grasp  all the Territory we can. I know much which I  do not tell. I have had bribes offered to me but I   have rejected them. The government will not receive  anything from me. They are self-sufficient; but they  must go to Hell and work out their own salvation  with fear and trembling. As soon as Texas  is anexed I would liberate two are three States  and pay them for their slaves and let them go  to Mexico where they are mixed blacks &c. I would  also receive Canadia and stand by it."    Next day March the 8th I met in  council with the Twelve and First Presidency when the  subject of nominating a candidate for the vice Presidency   of the U.S. came up. They had nominated  General Arlington Bennet not knowing that he was  a native of Ireland. The final decision was for  me to write to Col. Solomon Copeland to invite him  to visit us and see if he would suffer his name 
 to run for the Vice Presidency and I wrote to him accordingly    On the seventh day of this month Bro  King Follet was buried under Masonic honours. He  was killed while in a well by having a bucket of stone  fall on him    A large Assembly of the Saints net at  the Temple and was addressed by Joseph upon    The Work Calling & Spirit of Elias Elijah & Messiah    There is a difference between the spirit and  office of Elias and Elijah. It is the Spirit of Elias I   wish first to speak off. And in order to come to   the subject I will bring some of the testimony from  the scripture and give also my own.    In the first place suffice it to say  that I went into the woods to inquire of the Lord by prayer  His will concerning me and I saw an angel and he  laid his hands upon my head and ordained me to be a  priest after the order of Aaron and to hold the keys of this  Priesthood which office was to preach repentence and baptism  for the remission of sins and also to baptize. But  I was informed that this office did not extend to the  laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and that  that office was a greater work and was to be given afterward  but that my ordination at that time was a preparatory  work or a going before which was the spirit of Elias for   the spirit of Elias was a going before to prepare the way  for the greater    This was the case with John the Baptist  He came crying from the wilderness "Prepare ye the the  way of the Lord and make his paths straight and the people 
 were informed that if they would receive it it was the Spirit of Elias.  John was very particular to tell the people he was not that light  but was sent to bear witness thereof. He told them that his  mission was to preach repentance and baptism with water  but that it was he who should come after him who should  baptize with fire and the Holy Ghost. If he had been   an imposter he might have worked beyond his bounds   and undertook to have performed ordinances which did not  belong to the office and calling under the spirit of Elias    The spirit of Elias is to prepare the   way for a greater revelation of God. This is the priesthood   of Elias or the priesthood unto which Aaron was ordained  And when God sends a man into the world to prepare  for a greater work he holds the keys of the power of  Elias. It was called the doctrine of Elias even  from the early ages of the world    John's mission was limited to preaching  and baptizing but what he did was legal and when  Jesus Christ came to any of John's disciples he baptized  them with fire and the Holy Ghost.    We find the Apostles endowed  with greater power than John. Their office was more  under the Spirit and power of Elijah than of Elias  In the case of Philip when he went down to Samaria  under the Spirit of Elias he baptised both men and   women but when Peter and John heard of it they went  down and laid their hands on them and they received  the Holy Ghost. This shows the distinction between  the two powers. When Paul came to certain disciples  he asked if they had received the Holy Ghost. They  answered, "No." Who baptized you then?"  "We were baptized unto John's baptism." "No John  did not baptize your for he did his work right." 
 So Paul baptized them over again for he knew what the true  doctrine was and he knew that John had not baptized them  and it is strange to me that men who have read the script[ures]  of the New Testament are so far from these principles    What I want to impress upon your  mind is the difference of power in different parts of the  Priesthood so that when any man comes among you saying  I have the Spirit of Elias you may know whether he be  true or false for any man coming having the spirit   and power of Elias will not transcend his bounds. John  did not transcend his bounds but faithfully performed  that part belonging to his office. And every portion of  the great building should be prepared rightly and assigned   to its proper place    It is necessary to know who holds  the keys of power and who do not or we may be likely  to be deceived. That person who holds the keys of   Elias has a preparatory work. But if I spend   much more time in conversing about the spirit of  Elias I shall not have time to do justice to the spirit  and power of Elijah who is the Elias spoken of in the  last days. And here is the rock upon which many  split thinking the time was past in the days of  Jesus Christ and no more to be; but the spirit of   Elias was revealed to me and I know it is true therefor  I speak with boldness for I know verily my doctrine  is true.    Now for Elijah. The spirit power   and calling of Elijah is that we have power to hold   the keys of the revelations ordinances oracles and endowme[nt]  of the fulness of the Melchezedec Priesthood and of  the kingdom of God on the earth and to receive and  perform all the ordinances of the kingdom of God 
 even to the sealing of the hearts of the fathers unto the children and  the hearts of the children unto the fathers even those who are   in heaven.    Malachi says, "I will send Elijah  before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come and He  shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children and the hearts  of the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite the earth  with a curse    Now what I am after is the knowledge  of God and I take my own course to obtain it. What  are we to understand by thisthe mission of Elijah in the last days. In the  days of Noah God destroyed the world by a flood and  he had promised to destroy it by fire in the last  days. But before it takes place Elijah shall first   come and turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children &c  Now comes the point. What is the office and work   of Elijah?  and this is one of the most important subjects  that God has revealed.    He shall send Elijah to seal the  fathers to the children and the children to the fathers!  Now was this merely confined to the living to settle  difficulties with families on earth? By no means.  It was a far greater work. Elijah, What would   you do were you here? Would you confine your   work to the living alone. No. I would refer you  to the Scriptures where the subject is manifest.  "Without us they cannot be made perfect nor we without   them". the fathers without the children nor the children without the fathers.    I wish you to understand this subject   for it is important and if you will receive it this is the  Spirit of Elijah that we redeem our dead and connect  ourselves with our fathers who are in heaven and seal  up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection 
 And here we want the power of Elijah to seal those who  dwell on the earth to those who dwell in heaven. This is  the power of Elijah and the keys of the Kingdom of Jehovah    Let us suppose a case. Suppose the  great God who dwells in the heavens should reveal himself  to Father Cutter here and tell him I offer up a decree  that whatsoever you seal on earth with your decree will I  seal in heaven. You have power then? Can it be  taken off? No. Then what you seal on earth by   the power of Elijah is sealed in heaven and this is  the power of Elijah and herein is the difference between  the power of Elias and Elijah for while the spirit of  Elias is a forerunner the power of Elijah is sufficient  to make our calling and election sure; and it is  the same doctrine where we are exhorted to go on  unto perfection not laying again the foundation of   repentance from dead works but of laying on of hands  the resurrection of the dead &c. We cannot be perfect  without the Fathers &c. We must have revelation  then and we can see that the doctrine of revelation as  far transcends the doctrine of no revelation at all as  knowledge is above ignorance for one truth revalled  from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existance    This spirit of Elijah was manifest  in the days of the Apostles in delivering certain ones  over to the buffettings of Satan that they may be  saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. They were  sealed by the spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of   hell until the day of the Lord or revelation of  Jesus Christ.    Here is the doctrine of election that  the world have quarrelled so much about but they  do not know anything concerning it. The doctrine 
 that the Prysbeterians and Methodists have quarreled so much about  namely once in grace always in grace and on the other side the  falling away from grace I will say a word about. They are  both wrong. Truth takes the road between. The Prysbeterian  says once in grace you cannot fall. The Methodist says  you can have grace to day fall from it tomorrow next  day have grace again and so follow it on. But the   doctrine of the Scriptures and the spirit of Elijah would  show them both false and take the road between.  According to the Scriptures if a man has received the good  word of God and tasted of the powers of the world to come  if he shall fall away it is impossible to renew him  again seeing that he has crucified the Son of God  afresh and put him to an open shame    So there is a possibility of falling  away yet could not be renewed again and the power of Elijah cannot  seal against this sin for this is a reserve made in the  seals and power of the Priesthood.    I will make every doctrine plain  that I present and it shall stand upon a firm basis  and I am at the defiance of the world for I will take  shelter under the broad cover of the wings of the work  in which I am engaged. It matters not to me if all   hell boils over. I regard it only as I would the cracklings of  the thorns under the pot    A murderer for instance - one  who has shed inocent blood cannot have forgiveness  David sought repentance at the hand of God carefully  with tears; but he could only get it through hell. He  obtained a promise that his soul should not be left in   hell. Although David was king he never did obtain   the spirit and power of Elijah and the fulness of  the Priesthood and the priesthood that he received and 
 and the throne and kingdom of David are to be taken from  him and given to another by the name of David in  the last days raised up out of his lineage.    Peter refered to the same subject  on the day of Penticost but the multitude did not get  the endowment which Peter had; but several days after  the people asked  "what shall we do?" Speaking of their  crucifying the Lord Peter said "I wot that through ignorance  ye did it as did also your rulers" He did not say to  them repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins  but he said "Repent ye therefore and be converted that your  sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing  shall come from the presence of the Lord." This is the  case with murderers. They could not be baptized for   the remission of sins for they had shed inocent blood    Again to the doctrine of the sealing  power of Elijah. If you have power to seal on earth  and in heaven then you should be wise. The first thing  you do go and seal on earth your sons and daughters unto  yourself and yourself unto your fathers in eternal glory  and go ahead and not go back. Use a little craftiness  and seal all you can and and when you get to heaven tell  your father that what you sealed on earth should be sealed in  heaven. I will walk through the gate of heaven and  claim what I seal and those that follow me and my   counsel.    The Lord once told me that what I asked  for I should have. I have been afraid to ask God to  kill my enemies lest some of them should peradventure  repent. I asked a short time since for the Lord to  deliver me out of the hands of the Governor of Missouri  and if needs be to accomplish it to take him away  and the next news which came pouring down from 
 there was that Governor Reynolds had shot himself    I would now say Beware O Earth how you  fight against the Saints and shed inocent blood for in the days  of Elijah when his enemies came upon him fire was called down from  heaven and destroyed them    The Spirit of Elias is first Elijah second  and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way  and the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after holding the  keys of power, building the Temple to the cap-stone, placing  the seals of the Melchezedec Priesthood upon the house of  Israel and making all things ready. Then Messiah  comes to his Temple which is last of all    Messiah is above the spirit and power   of Elijah for he made the world and was that spiritual  rock unto Moses in the wilderness. Elijah was to come  and prepare the way and build up the kingdom before the   coming of the great day of the Lord though the spirit of  Elias was to begin it.    I have asked the Lord concerning his  coming and while asking the Lord gave me a sign and  said "In the days of Noah I set a bow in the heavens as  a sign and token. In any year that the bow shall be  seen the Lord will not come but there shall be sead time  and harvest during that year. But whenever you see the  bow withdraw it shall be a token that there shall be  famine pestilence and great distress among the nations    But I will take the responsibility upon   myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord that Christ  will not come as Miller has prophesied for we have seen  the bow and I also prophesy in the name of the Lord that  Christ will not come in forty years and if ever the Lord   spake by my mouth he will not come in that time  Jesus never did reveal to any man the precise time 
 that he would come. Go and read the scriptures and you  cannot find any part which specifies the exact time of his  coming and all who say so are false teachers. There are   some important things concerning the office of the Messiah  in the organization of the kingdom of God of which I   will speak hereafter."    The Sunday fortnight when I arrived at  the Temple Joseph was speaking. He said    "I have been informed by two gentlemen  that a conspiracy is got up in this place for the purpose  of taking the life of President Joseph Smith his family  and all the Smith family and also the heads of the  Church. One of the gentlemen will give his name  to the public and the other wishes it to be hid for  the present. They will both testify to it on oath  and make an affadavit upon it. The names of the   persons revealled at the head of the conspiracy are Chancy  Higby Dr Foster Mr Jackson and William and Wilson Law  And the lies which Highby has hatched up as a foundation  is--he says that I had mens heads cut off in Missouri  and that I had a sword run through the hearts of the  people whom I wanted to kill and out of the way.    I wont sware out a warrant against  them for I do not fear any of them. They would not scare   off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquity  that I know of them. If I am guilty I am ready to  bear it. There is honour among enemies. I am  willing to do anything for the good of the people. I  will give the name of one of the gentlemen who have  devulged the plot. His name is Eaton. He will  sware to it. He is a bold fellow. Jackson said 
 a Smith should not be alive two weeks not over two months anyhow  As concerning the character of these men I will say nothing about it  now but if I hear any more from them upon this subject I will tell  all I know about them"    Orson Spencer and Sidney Rigdon followed with  addresses to the Assembly and then Joseph again arose and  remarked upon a point of Sidney's discourse. He said    In relation to the power of the minds  of mankind which I hold I would say it is in consequence  of the power in the doctrines which I have been an instru-  ment in the hands of God of presenting unto them and  not because of any compu[l]sion on my part. I will ask  if I ever got any of it unfair? if I have not reproved you   in the gate? I ask did I ever exercise compulsion over  any man? Did I not give him the liberty of disbelieving  any doctrine I preached if he saw fit? Why do not  my enemies strike a blow at my doctrine? They  cannot do it. It is truth; and I am as the voice  of one crying in the wilderness. "Repent of your sins  and prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man  for the Kingdom of God has come unto you and   hence forth the axe is laid unto the root of the tree  and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit God  Almighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down   and cast into the fire"    Twelve days later I attended the  dedication of the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge. This was  the first Masonic dedication I ever attended. The   procession was composed of about five hundred members  and the whole was grand and imposing    In the forepart of the day President  Joseph Smith was to have preached the funeral sermon 
 of King Follet one of the Masonic Brotherhood but in consequence  of ill health he omitted it and called upon Elder Amasa Lyman  to address the multitude who had assembled on purpose to   hear the funeral discourse from Joseph.    The day following this was the anniversary  of the Church which opened our anual General Conference    General Conference  of the  Church of Jesus Christ of L.S.D [L.D.S.]  held at Nauvoo  April 6th A.D. 1844.    Conference commenced at 10 am. President Brigham   Young called the Conference to order. The Prophet  then said that he should not occupy time in speaking  of any differences which might have occurred in our  midst He said he was not a Fallen Prophet  and never sustained a nearer relationship to God than  at the present time and would show before the  conference closed that God was with him    Sidney Rigdon afterwards spoke  and during the Conference of the several days he  delivered three important discourses of which I reported a  synopsis in my journal and which will be found embodied  in the History of Joseph Smith    On the 3rd Sunday of the  Sunday the 7th in the afternoon the Prophet Joseph   delivered one of the most important discourses of his  life to about ten thousand souls upon the subject   of the death of King Follet. 
 Joseph's Great Discourse  (recorded in my Journal)    I now call the attention of this congregation  while I address you upon the subject of the dead.    The case of our beloved brother King  Follet who was crushed to death in a well, as also many  others who have lost friends will be had in mind this afternoon  and I shall speak upon the subject in general as far as I  shall be inspired by the Holy Spirit to treat upon it    I want the prayers and faith of the   Saints that I might have the Holy Ghost so that the  testimony may carry conviction to your minds of the  truth of what I shall say and I pray that the Lord  may strengthen my lungs. There is strength here and  your prayers will be heard.    Before I enter upon an investigation   of this subject I wish to pave the way and bring up  the subject from the beginning that you may understand  I do not intend to please you with oratory but with the  simple truths of heaven to edify you.    Go to the morn of Creation to understand  the decrees of Eloheim at the creation. It is necessary  that we have an understanding of God at the beginning  If we get a good start at first we can go right but if  you start wrong you may go wrong    But few understand the character  of God. They do not know Him they do not   understand their relationship to Him. The world know  no more than the brute beast. They know no more  than to eat drink and sleep. This is all man knows  about God or His existance except what is given by the inspiration 
 of the Almighty.    Go then to the beginning that you may  understand. I ask this congregation what kind of a  being is God? Turn your thoughts in your own  hearts and say have any of you seen or heard Him  or communed with Him. This is a question which  may occupy your attention. The scriptures informs us  that this is eternal life to know thee the only true and  living God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. If  any enquire What kind of a being God is I would say  if you do not know Him you have not eternal life  Go back and find out what kind of a being God is.  If I am the man that shows you what kind of being   God is then let every man and woman sit in silence  and never lift up the hand against me again. If I  do not this I will make no more pretentions to  inspiration or to be a Prophet. I should be like the  rest of the world a false teacher and you would want  to take my life. But you might just as well  take the lives of other false teachers as mine if I  was false. But meddle not with any man for his  religion. Every Government ought to protect every man  to enjoy his religion    I will show the world is wrong by  showing what God is. I am going to enquire  after Him so that you may know God that persecution  may cease concerning me. I will go back to the  beginning to show what kind of a being God was. I  will tell you and hear it O Earth! God who sits in  Yonder heavens is a man like unto yourselves.  That God if you were to see Him to day who holds  the worlds you would see Him like a man - in form  like yourselves. Adam was made in His 
 image and talked and walked with Him    In order to understand the dead for the  consolation of those who mourn I want you to understand God and  how he came to be God. We have supposed that God was God   from eternity. I will refute that idea or I will take away  the veil so that you may see. It is one of the first principles  to know that we may converse with Him. He was once a  man like unto us and the Father was once on an earth  like us, and I wish I was in a suitable place to tell it    The scriptures inform us, mark it, that  Jesus Christ said "As the Father hath power in Himself so  hath the Son power in Himself." To do what? The Father did even  to lay down my body and take it up again. Do you believe  it? If not you do not believe the Bible. I will defy all hell and  earth to refute this. And you have got to learn how to become  yourself God king and priest by going from a small capacity  to a great capacity, to the resurrection of the dead and to  dwelling in everlasting burning. I want you to learn the  first principle of this order    How consoling to the mourners when  they part with their friends to know that though they lay down  this body it will rise and dwell in everlasting burning  to be an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus Christ  enjoying the same exaltation and glory until you arrive at  the station of a God    What did Jesus Christ do? "The  same as I see the Father do." See the Father do what?  "Work out a kingdom. When I have done so too I will  give it up to the Father which will add to His glory  He will then take a higher exaltation and I shall   take His place and be also exalted"    These are the first principles of   the Gospel. It will take a long time after the 
 grave to understand the whole    If I should say anything but what was in  the Bible the cry of treason would be heard. I will then  go to the Bible and will make a comment on the very  first sentence of the history of the Creation--Berosheit. I want  to analize the word; baith, in, by, through and everything  else. Rosh, the head; sheit, gramatical termination  When the inspired man wrote it he did not put the baith  there; an old Jew without any authority added the word: he  thought it too bad to begin to talk about the head. It reat[d] at   first "The head one of the Gods brought forth the Gods: that is  the true meaning of the words. Baurau signifies to  bring forth. If you do not believe it you do not   believe the learned man of God. Learned men can  teach you no more than what I have told you. Thus   the head God brought forth the Gods in the grand council  I will transpose it in the English language. I want you to  know and learn that the Holy Ghost knows something.  The Grand Council sat at the head and contemplated the  Creation of the world. Some will say the scriptures  say so and so; but I will show you a test out of an old  edition of the New Testament in the Hebrew Latin  German and Greek languages. In the 21 verse of the  fourth ch. of Mathew our common translation says  James the Son of Zebedee but this old book in my  possession says Jacob the Son of Zebedee in each of the  four languages - the Hebrew Latin German and Greek  The doctors (I mean the doctors of the law) say if you  preach anything not according to the Bible we will cry  treason; but if ye are not led by revelation How can ye   escape the damnation of hell. Here we have the testimony  of four against one--the present translation. I have the oldest  book in the world and the Holy Ghost besides. I thank God  for the old book but more for the Holy Ghost. 
 In the beginning the head of the Gods called a council of  the Gods and they came together and concocted a plan to create the world and people  it. Having a knowledge of God and what kind of a being he is we know   how to approach him and how to ask so as to receive an answer.  Another thing, the learned say the Lord made the world out of nothing and they accounted  blasphemy in any one to contradict their idea. If you tell them God made the  world out of something they will account you a fool. But I am more learned in the  things of God than they and know more than all the world put together: the Holy Ghost does  anyhow and he is within me and comprehends more than all the world and I will  associate myself with him. They infer from the word create that the world must  have been made out of nothing. Now the word create came from the word Baurau  and does not mean to create out of nothing but to organize the same as a man would organize  materials to build a ship. Element had an existance. from the time God had. It can be organized  and reorganized but not destroyed. I have another subject to speak upon calculated to exalt man  It is associated with the subject of the ressurection of the dead--namely, the soul  the mind of man, the immortal spirit, where did it come  from? The learned say God made it in the beginning  But it is not so. I know better. God has told me  If you do not believe it that will not make the truth  without effect. God was a self-existing being Man  exists upon the same principle. God made a tabernacle  and put the spirit into it and man became a human  soul. Man existed in spirit and mind co-equal  with God Himself    You who mourn the loss of friends  are only seperated from them but for a moment.  The spirit is seperated for a little time but they are   conversant with each other as we are on earth. I am  dwelling on the immutibility of the spirit of man  Is it logic to say the spirit of man had a beginning  and yet has no end? It does not have either a  beginning or end. My ring is like the existance  of the soul of man. It has no beginning or end. If  it were cut in two there would be both a beginning  and an end. So with man. If he had a beginning   he would also have an end.    If I am right I might say God never  had power to create the spirit of man. God Himself  could not create himself. Intelligence is eternal 
 and it is self-existing. All mind is succeptible of improvement  The relationship we sustain with God places us in a situation  to advance in knowledge. God has power to institute laws  to instructe the lesser intelligences that they may be exalted  with Himself. This is good doctrine. It tastes good  I can taste the principles of eternal life. So can you  They are given to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ  and I know you believe it. All that which God  sees fit to reveal in relation to us makes known his  will to our spirits precisely as though we had no bodies  at all and those revelations which will save our spirits will  also save our bodies: hence the awful responsibility which rests  upon us in relation to our dead for all the spirits who have not  obeyed the Gospel in the flesh must obey it in the spirit or be  damned. Would to God I had forty days and nights in which  to tell you all; I would let you know that I am not  'a fallen prophet.'    The greatest responsibility laid upon us in this  life is to seek after our dead. The Apostle says they  without us cannot be made perfect for it is necessary that  the sealing powers should be in our hands to seal our children  and our dead for the fulness of the dispensation of times -  a dispensation to meet the promises made by Jesus Christ  before the foundation of the world for the Salvation of man  It is necessary that those who are gone before and those who come  after us should have salvation in common with us and thus  has God made it obligatory upon man. Hence He has said  I will send Elijah the Prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children    From before the foundation of the world God hath  made provisions to suit the conditions of man. Jesus said, "All  sins and blasphemy except the sin against the Holy Ghost should  be forgiven and there is a salvation for all either in this  world or the world to come who have not committed the unpardonable 
 sin. God has made provision that every spirit in the eternal world can be  saved unless he has committed this sin and the spirits of our friends  can be searched out and saved. Any man who has a friend in eternity  can save him of he has not committed the unpardonable sin.    A man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after the  dissolution of the body and there is a possibility of his escape. If a  man has knowledge he can be saved. If he has been guilty  of great sins he is punished for them. When he consents to  obey the Gospel whether alive or dead he is saved.    A man's own mind damns him. I  have no fear of hell fire. It does not exist. The torment  of disapointment in the mind of man is as a lake burning  with fire and brimstone.    No man can commit the unpardonable  sin until he receives the Holy Ghost and then it must be  done in this world and cannot be committed after the  dissolution of the body. Hence the salvation of Jesus   Christ wrought for all men triumphs over the devil  for even he stood up as a Saviour. All who suffer until  they obey Christ himself.    The contention in heaven was--Jesus said  there would be souls who would not be saved and the Devil  said he could save them all and laid his plans before the  grand Council who gave their vote in favour of Jesus Christ  so the devil rose up in rebellion against God and was cast  down with all who put up their hands for him.    Jesus Christ will save all except the sons   of Perdition. What must a man do to commit the   unpardonable sin. He must receive the Holy Ghost have  the heavens opened to him and know God and then sin  against Him. After a man has sinned against the  Holy Ghost there is no repentance for him. He has got to  say the sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to 
 to deny Jesus Christ when the heavens have been opened to him and  to deny the plan of salvation with his eyes open to the truth and from   that time he begins to be an enemy. This is the case with many apostates  of the Church. They never cease to try to hurt me and thirst for my  blood; they have the spirit of the devil which crucified the Lord of  Life - the same that sins against the Holy Ghost. You cannot  save them. They make open war like the Devil.  If a spirit of bitterness is in you dont be in haste. You may say   that man is a sinner. Well if he repents he shall be forgiven. Be  cautious. When you find a spirit that wants murder the same  is of the devil.    I could go back and trace every subject of interest concerning the  relationship of man to God if I had time and enter largely into the  eternal worlds. Jesus says there are many mansions in my Fathers  Kingdom and Paul says there is one glory of the sun another of the Moon  another of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory  So also is the resurrection of the dead. What have we to console us in  relation to our dead? The greatest hope of any people on earth. We   have seen them walk worthily in our midst and sink asteep in  the arms of Jesus and those who have died in the faith are now  in the celestial kingdom of God. They have gone to await the resurrection  of the dead to go into celestial glory while there are many who will  have to wait myrids of years before they can receive the like  blessings. I am authorized to say to you by the authority of the   Holy Ghost that you have no occasion to fear. You may wait for  your friends to meet you in the morn of the celestial world.  Those who have been murdered in the persecution shall triumph glorious  in the celestial world while their murdersers shall dwell in torment for  ages until they have paid the uttermost farthing    I have a father brothers chrildren and friends who gone to a   world of spirits. They are only absent for a moment, and we shall soon meet  again. The time will soon arrive when the trumphet shall sound. When we  depart we shall hail our mothers, fathers, friends and all whom we love who  have fallen asleep in Jesus. There will be no fear of mobs &c. It will be an  eternity of felicity.    A question may be asked will mothers have their  children in eternity. Yes yes mothers. You shall have your children 
 for they shall have eternal life; for their debt is paid. There is no damnation awaiting  them. They are in the Spirit. But as the child dies so shall it rise from the dead and  be forever living in the learning of God. It will never grow. It will still be the child  in the same precise form as it appeared before it died out ofits mothers  arms but possessing all the intelligence of a God. Children dwell in the mansions of  glory and exercise power but appear in the same form as when on earth. Eternity  is full of thrones upon which dwell thousands of children reigning on thrones of  glory with not one cubit added to their stature.    I will leave this subject here and make a few remarks  upon the subject of baptism. The baptism of water without the baptism of  fire and the Holy Ghost is of no use. They are inseperably connected. An  individual must be born of water and the spirit in order to enter the kingdom  of God. In German the test bears me out the same as the revelations which  I have given and taught for the last fourteen years on that subject. You  will find it in the declaration of John the Baptist. (reads from the German)  John says "I baptize you with water but when Jesus comes who has the  power (or keys) he shall administer the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost"    There is one God one Father one Jesus one hope of our calling one  baptism. All these three baptisms only make one. Many talk of baptism  not being essential to salvation; but this kind of teaching would lay the  foundation of their damnation. I have the truth and am at the  defiance of the world to contradict me if they can    Hear it all ye ends of the earth - all ye priests - all ye sinners  and all men, - Repent, repent! obey the Gospel; turn to God for your  religion wont save you, and you will be damned: I do not say how long.  There have been remarks made concerning all men being redeemed from hell  but I say that those who sin against the Holy Ghost cannot be forgiven  in this world or the world to come. They shall die the second death. Those   who commit the unpardonable sin are doomed to Gnolom to dwell in  hell worlds without end. As they concoct scenes of bloodshed in this world so  they shall rise to that resurrection which is as the lake of fire and brimstone  Some shall rise to the everlasting burning of God, for God dwells in everlasting  burnings and some shall rise to the damnation of their own filthiness  which is as exquisite a torment as the lake of fire and brimstone    I have no enmity against any man. I love you all but  I hate some of your deeds. I am your best friend and if persons miss  their mark it is their own fault. If I reprove a man and he hates me  he is a fool for I love all men especially these my brethren and sisters    I rejoice to hear the testimony of some of my aged  friends. You dont know me. You never knew my heart. No  man knows my history. I cannot tell it. I shall never  undertake it. I dont blame anyone for not believing my   history. If I had not experienced what I have I could not  have believed it myself. I never did harm any man since  I was born into the world. My voice is always for peace.    I cannot lie down until all my work is finished.  I never think any evil nor do anything to the harm of my fellow  man. When I am called by the trumph of the archangel  and weighed in the balance you will all know me then.    I add no more God bless you all. Amen 
 Conference reassembled the next day April the 8th  when Joseph arose and said it was impossible for him to  continue the subject of the previous day in consequence of the  weakness of his lungs. But among his brief remarks was  one of the most important revelations of the age. He said    Yet I have    A Great Proclamation    It is in relation to Zion and a proclamation for the  Elders to teach the Church hereafter. The whole of   South & North America is Zion and the mountain of the  Lord's house is in the centre of North and South America  When the House is done the baptismal font erected  and finished and the worthy are washed anointed endowed &  ordained kings and priests which must be done in this life -  and when the place is prepared you must also go through  all the ordinances of the house of the Lord and if  you have any dead relations for them also the same  as for yourselves - then the Elders are to go through all  America and build up Churches until all Zion is built  up. But this is not to commence until this Temple   is built and the Elders are endowed. Then go forth  and accomplish the work and build up stakes in  all North and South America. There will be some  place ordained for the redeeming of the dead. I think  this will be the one.    He also remarked that this proclamation  was the greatest ever made to us as all could not  come here but it was necessary that enough should  come to build up the Temple and get an endowment so  that the work could spread abroad    Joseph's lungs failed him and he called  upon George G. Adams to occupy the forenoon 
 At the close of the morning's meeting President Joseph  Smith turned over the Conference into the hands of the Twelve  and it continued through the next day under the presidency  of Brigham Young and then adjourned to the following  Saturday to re-assemble at 2 o clock to hear a political  address from Elder John Taylor.    During this Conference  Elders volunteered to go into the vineyard that season to preach   the Gospel    On the 4th of May I moved into my  new brick house and felt truly thankful to have a  comfortable dwelling for the first time to have my  family in while I went out again on mission.    Next day I spent with my family  preparing for my Summer's mission and I called  my family together and blessed them and Phebe washed  my feet that I might be clean every whit    A number of Apostates on the same   day  which was Sunday the 5th met together and organized  a new Church and took a strong stand against  the Prophet the Twelve and the Church. The leaders  were Wm. [William] and Wilson Law R.D. Foster Chauncy  and Francis Highby James Blakesley and others.    Five days later which was May  the 9th I arose in the morning arranged some domestic  affairs and parted from my wife and children for the  purpose of taking my summers mission through the  United States to attend the General Conferences  For the last ten years of my life with the exception of  one it had been my lot to be in the vineyard every  summer. I left Nauvoo in company with  Elders George A Smith J. M. Grant and Ezra Thayer 
 and his son.    This was the last mission ever Joseph  the Prophet gave to the Twelve Apostles of this dispensation  He wished none of us to remain with the exception of Willard  Richards. He told John Taylor he wanted him to  go especially on this mission with his quorum and he  spoke with much earnestness. He also turned to me  and said brother Woodruff I want you to go and if  you do not you will die. It rested with weight upon   my mind at the time he spoke and I have often thought  since when musing over the awful catastrophy of his & Hyrums  martyrdom how true his words might have been had I  remained. Elder Taylor did remain and he and Willard  Richards the only ones of the Twelve left in Nauvoo where  with him in prison at his assassination. Had more  of us been there with him in Nauvoo we might some  of us have met the death which Elder John Taylor  but barely escaped. having received  It might have been that Willard Richards who was the  only one whom Joseph wished to stay with him of the  Twelve was also the only one of us who could stay with  him safely unhurt and he passed through that awful scene   of the martyrdom of our Prophet and Patriarch safe  from personal harm.    I took the parting hand of Joseph  and Hyrum at their own dwelling. Joseph was  standing in his own entery when I took his hand to  bid him farewell. Brother J. M. Grant was with  me. As he took me by the hand he said  "Brother Woodruff, you are now about to start upon  your mission" I answered "Yes" He looked  me steadily in the eye for a time without speaking  He looked as though he would penetrate my very 
 soul but at the same time seemed unspeakably sorrowful as  though he was weighed down with a foreboding of something  dreadful in the future. He finally spoke in a mournful  voice - "God bless you Brother Woodruff! Go in peace!"  I turned and left him with a sorrowful heart partaking  of the same spirit that rested upon him. This was the   last time I ever saw his face or heard his voice again.    During the following week we journeyed  on our mission held meetings and on the 18th in Newark  Kendall Co George A Smith and myself of the Twelve  held our first conference at which were present various other   officers of the Church. At the close of the Conference  Elders Charles C. Rich David Fulmer and Henry Jacobs  arrived from Nauvoo    Next evening we all met at the school  House to deliver a political lecture. I called the meeting  to order and introduced to the assembly Mr Henry Jacobs  who arose and read General J Smiths views of the policy  and powers of the United States Government after  which I introduced Mr David Fulmer who addressed the  assembly in an effective manner showing the policy  of Joseph and then I urged our claims and right to vote  for our own president and George A Smith closed with  a spirited political address. The next evening we  also held another meeting for the same object and had   quite a time in political spirit and the impression   made on the people was good. We had rode on this  day thirty miles to hold our meeting in a large school  room in Juliett    We continued from place to place  holding meetings reading the views of General Joseph   Smith to public assemblies making political speeches  and placing Joseph before the public as a fitting 
 candidate for the Presidency of the United States    On the 1st of June we held the Kalamazoo  Conference in Comstock Kalamazoo Co. Michigan. There  were present 2 of the quorum of the Twelve--Wilford  Woodruff and George A Smith; 3 High Priests--S. Bent  Charles C. Rich and D. Fulmer; 5 of the High Priest  quorum - H Green, Z Coltrin Moses Smith, E Thayer  and G. Coltrin and also 8 of the Seventies, 14 Elders  2 Priests and 1 Deacon.    The conference was called to order by  Elder Charles C. Rich when Elder Wilford Woodruff  was chosen to the chair and Elders C. Dunn and  E M Webb as clerks of the Conference.    The various Branches were represented  & President C. C. Rich in council with the officers after  the close of the Conference appointed the Elders to their  stations in the different Counties of the State and   he manifested much wisdom in arranging his plans in   carrying out his work both on politics and religion in the  State of Michigan that season    On the 8th we held the Pleasant Valley  Conference and on the 15th another Conference was held  by us in Franklin Oaklin Co    On the 26 alone I arrived at  Boston and next day had an interview with Elder Brigham  Young. We spent the forepart of the day together    Early in the evening he took cars for  Salem. This was on    The Day of the Martyrdom    Elder Brigham Young and myself were setting together in  the railway station at the time that Joseph and his brother 
 Hyrum were assassinated. This was June the 27th at a quarter past   five at Carthage the place of the fiendish tragedy and halfpast six p.m.  at Boston where Elder Young and myself were. Brigham as we  sat together in the Station was very sorrowful and depressed in spirit  without knowing the cause. This was the time that the direst blow  which Satan had struck since the Son of God was crucified sent the  spirits of the Prophet and Patriarch to join the martyred host of God's servants  Too well we afterwards knew why all the Twelve wherever they were  on that day and at that time were like the President of our quorum  very sorrowful and burdened in spirit without knowing why.    Two days afterwards we held the    Boston Conference  of the  Church of Jesus Latter Day Saints  at Franklin Hall  June 29, 1844    There was present a majority of the quorum of the   Twelve- namely, Brigham Young its President Heber  C. Kimball Orson Hyde Orson Pratt William Smith  Lyman Wight and Wilford Woodruff; and also a  large number of Elders. Brigham Young  presided.    The Conference continued for two days  and was addressed by Orson Hyde Brigham Young  H. C. Kimball Lyman Wight Orson Pratt and  Wilford Woodruff    The Conference was well attended  the meeting spirity and the discourses instructive  and effectual. 
 State Convention of Jeffersonian Democracy.    Ticket: General Joseph Smith for the Presidential Chair  Sidney Rigdon Vice President    The convention met at 10 o clock a.m. July 1st  in the Milodian [Melodeon] at Boston, and was organized as  follows    The Hon Brigham Young of Nauvoo President  The Hons William Smith and Gen Lyman Wight  vice Presidents  The Hon Wilford Woodruff and Professor O Pratt  of Illinois A Mc Allister Esq of Boston  and N H Felt Esq of Salem secretaries.    The convention was addressed with much  animation and patriotism during the day and evening   by the President Hons Orson Hyde Daniel Spencer William  Smith and Proffessor Pratt all of Illinois and George B  Wallace of Boston    A preamble and many important  resolutions were adopted all of which together with the   proceedings of the meeting were published in the Boston  Times of July 2nd 1844.    The Melodian was crowded in  the evening and it was soon evident that a large number  of rowdies were in the galleries and disposed to make  disturbance. Among others Abby Folsom made her   appearance and arose and commenced speaking while  the President of the convention was addressing the 
 meeting. A young man soon afterwards arose and began rowdy conduct  in which he was encouraged by his companions until confusion became  general in the gallery. The police came in to take the  young man out but they were badly beaten by a set of   young desperadoes. After much hard fighting however the  officers succeeded in clearing the gallery of the rowdies but the  meeting was also soon broken up    The convention was adjourned until the next  day at 4 o'clock at Bunker Hill. Heber C. Kimball  and George B Walace were appointed delegates to the Baltimore  national convention.    We met at 8 o clock a.m. on the 2nd of  July held a council and devided ourselves off into different  parts of the vineyard and each one took several conferences  to attend to    The same night I left the city in  company with Milton Holmes and old companion  and fellow labourer in the ministry whom I had not   met for five years. We left Boston at 7 o clock p.m.    Next day we arrived at Father  Carter's early in the afternoon and found my wifes   father and mother and her brother Fabyan and family  all well.    I descovered on my arrival that brother  S. B. Stoddard and had given out an appointment  for our conference which was held in Scarboro on  the 6th and 7th in a Presbyterian Meeting House.    There were present of the Elders  Wilford Woodruff S. B. Stoddard Milton Holmes  Elbridge Tufts and Samuel Parker. On the  Sunday afternoon we had an audience of about six  hundred. 
 In company of Father Carter and Milton Holmes  I left Scarboro on the 9th and rode to Portland and dined  with my brother-in-law Ezra Carter and was about to take  steam boat in the evening for Thomastown and Fox Islands  but in the afternoon we obtained the Boston Times  containing the solemn information of the assassination of the  Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum    Next day I took the cars for Boston  and on the following met with the Saints. They mourned  the loss of the Prophet and Patriarch yet through our meeting  they were strengthened in the faith and the comfort of the  Spirit was with us so that we had a good time together    On the morrow I wrote a letter  to the Editor of the Prophet published in New York  by the friends of our martyred leader giving a word  of exhortation to the Saints abroad to maintain their  integrity and keep the faith and paitence of the  saints unto death    The following morning we obtained  information from Quincy as late as June 29th giving  full accounts of the horrid affair at Carthage and the  tremendious loss which the Church had sustained.  The Governor himself acknowledged the death of Joseph  and Hyrum to be a wanton murder. The State of  Illinois was in commotion and Governor Ford had  made Quincy his head quarters and issued a proclamation  to the citizens of the state. The news of the day  stated that the Mormon Leaders in Nauvoo had done  all they could to restrain the disciples of the martyred  Prophet from vengeance still there was evidently a  disposition of both the people and the troops to destroy  Nauvoo lest the Mormons should hold a fearful  reckoning in the state in their desperation and despair 
 at the loss and assassination of the Prophet and Patriarch of the Church  The wicked fleeth when no man pursueth.    I again held meeting with the Boston Saints  on Sunday the 14th preached to them in the forenoon ^from Rev Ch VI verse 9, 10, 11, & 12;^ administered   the sacrament in the afternoon and preached again in the evening  I was the only one of the Twelve at that time in Boston.    We had not heard from any of our brethren  of the calamity which had fallen upon us in the great berevement  of the Church but as I arose on the morning of the 16th two  letters were handed to me one from Erastus Snow and the other  from John E. Page confirming the martyrdom of the Prophet   and Patriarch.    I immediately wrote three letters to Brigham   Young and sent one to Peterboro N. H. one to Lowell  and one to Bradford Mass. I then went direct to the  post office and took out a letter directed to G. A. Smith from  his wife in which Mrs Woodruff wrote a few lines to me  which was the first intelligence I had from her since I left   home. She related to me a dream which Joseph had  a few days before he sealed his testimony with his blood    He thought that William and Wilson  Law bound him and cast him into a pit or well  like as Joseph was anciently. He struggled hard  and got up so that he could look out and he saw  the Laws a little distance off one of them in the  grasp of a tigar and the other in that of a snake  They called to Him to come and help them but he told them  they had bound him and he could not; and he thought  in his dream that a brother soon came along and took  him out of the pit.    On the following day July 17th  Elder Brigham Young arrived in Boston. I walked   with him to 57 Temple Street and called upon 
 Sister Vose. Brother Young took the bed and I the arm   chair and here we veiled our faces and gave vent to our  grief. Until now I had not shed a tear since I heard  of the death of the Prophet but my soul had felt nerved  up like steel. After giving vent to our grief in tears  we felt more composed. Brother Brigham left the  city again on the same day    On the following day Elders Orson Hyde  Heber C. Kimball and Orson Pratt arrived in the city  and President Brigham Young also returned and we met  together and held a council. I wrote a letter to the   Prophet advising the Elders who haved families in  Nauvoo to go immediately to them and for all the  authorities of the Church to forthwith assemble at  Nauvoo for a Council: "By order of the Quorum of  the Twelve. Wilford Woodruff clerk; Brigham Young  President. (Published in Deseret News Vol VII. No 44)    That night there was a meeting in a   hall in Washington Street opposite Boydston Hall.  Elder Orson Hyde had advertized to preach on the murder  of Joseph and Hyrum Smith at the close of which a  collection was to be taken up to pay his expences  home. I reported a synopsis of his address and  recorded it in my journal.    At the close of Elder Hyde's discourse  President Brigham Young arose and said he felt disposed  to add his testimony    "Be of good cheer. The testimony is  not in force while the Testator liveth: when he died  it was in force: so it is with Joseph. On the day  of Pentecost there were but one hundred and twenty of  the Saints but at that time there was added three  thousand souls. When God sends a man to do a 
 work all the devils in hell cannot kill him until he gets through  his work: So with Joseph. He prepared all things gave the keys  to men on the earth and said I may soon be taken from you."    I left Boston on the 20th and arrived at my  father's house in Farmington two days later. I found my father  and stepmother alone, not a child with them in their decline of  life to watch over them    I had but twenty four hours to stay  and I happily improved the time. My father was 67 years  of age and I might never have seen him again in mortality  and my mind had been deeply impressed of late that I  had something to do for my parents.    As the sable shades of a serene night  drew her curtain over the earth and stilled the cares of day  we met alone: none but congenial spirits were there. I  arose and with the spirit like that of Joseph towards his  father Jacob opened my heart to my father and he reciprocated  my sentiments. I then laid my hands upon his head and  according to the authority of the Priesthood and Apostleship  (confered upon me under the hands of the Twelve Apostles  upon the corner stone of the house of the Lord in Far West  President Brigham Young being mouth) I ordained my  father Aphek Woodruff unto the office of an High  priest and Patriarch after the order of Melchezedic and  I placed upon his head the seals of the covenant in connection  with Bulah Thompson and Azubah Hart -- my own   mother and stepmother and sealed him up unto eternal  life. I shall never forget the deep satisfaction and   heavenly spirit of that night beneath my father's roof  Sleep departed from me and I was wrapt in the  meditations and visions of by gone days and the days  to come and of this life and the one hereafter. 
 The next day I again left my father's house  and arrived in New York on the next  [inserted in pencil] following [changes back to ink] morning. I then  took steamboat and found on board Elders Orson Hyde and Orson Pratt  We were bound for Albany at which place when we arrived  we took the rail for Buffaloo and on the way at Schenectady  we joined Elders B. Young H. C. Kimball and Lyman Wight  making six of our quorum journeying homewards together    We reached Buffaloo on the 25 and next  morning took steam boat and in 24 hours reached Cleveland  but Orson Hyde left us at Fairport to visit his family in  Kirtland    Arriving at Detroit we spent the night of the  27th at the railroad hotel and the next morning took steamboat  propeller Hercules for Chicago.    This was Sunday. I spent a part of   the day in writing. We had good state rooms and was  comfortable. We spoke much of our families and the death  of Joseph and Hyrum, and we felt anxious to get home    President Young expressed his feelings to  me upon a variety of subjects and among other things he said  he wished me to keep an account of things as he should  look to me for his journal some day. I had an  interesting time with Lyman Wight talking over old times  and looking forward to new ones    Joseph's Presentment that he would not see the Age of Forty.    During our conversation Lyman Whight informed me  that Joseph told him while they were in gaol [jail] together [changes to pencil] in [changes back to ink] that he  Missouri that he should not live to see his fortieth year  of age but bid him not to reveal it until he was dead.    Two nights before our arrival in Nauvoo  Elder Kimball had a dream which he related to us. He 
 thought he was preaching to a large congregation upon the policy of the nation  and of the work of God, and he said Joseph had laid the foundation and we  should have to carry out his measures. Joseph was himself present and heard all  and sanctioned it. All seemed perfectly natural    We stoped at various places going down the Mississippi:  among others the town of Burlington. We then prepared our  minds to once more behold the City of Nauvoo and embrace  our families and friends    August the 6th We were landed at the upper stone  house at 8 in the evening and were welcomed with joy  by all the citizens we met. We hired a coach and I  accompanied my brethren to their families after which I  was conveyed to my own and truly felt to rejoice to once  more meet with my wife children and friends    When we landed in the city of Nauvoo  a deep gloom seemed to rest over it which we never experienced  before. This was August the 6th    The next morning I went through the  city of Nauvoo saw many friends and net in council with  the quorum of the Twelve at Elder Taylor's whom we found  recovering from his wounds received at the massacre of the  Prophet and Patriarch of the Church    We felt to rejoice at again having   the privilege of meeting together in council in Nauvoo  after passing through such trying scenes and to be welcomed  by the Saints who considered it providential for the Twelve  to arrive at this particular juncture when their minds were  agitated their hearts sorrowfull and darkness seemed to  cloud their path feeling like a sheep without a shepherd their  beloved Prophet having been taken away    We spent the forepart of the day in  council at brother Taylors and in the afternoon at 4 o'clock  the Twelve the High Council and the High Priests met  at the Seventies Hall 
 After prayer by W[illia]m Marks President of the   stake President Brigham Young called upon President Rigdon  to make a statement to the Church concerning his message to  the Saints and the vision and revelation he had received    President Rigdon said, The object of my mission  is to visit the saints and offer myself to them as a Guardian  I had a vision at Pittsburg June the 27th. This was presented  to my mind not as an open vision but rather a continuation  of the vision mentioned in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants    It was shown to me that this Church must  be built up to Joseph and that all the blessings we receive  must come through him. I have been ordained a Spokesman  to Joseph and I must come to Nauvoo and see that the  Church is goverened in a proper manner. Joseph sustained the  same relationship to this Church as he has always done. No  man can be the succcessor of Joseph    The kingdom is to be built up to Jesus Christ  through Joseph. There must be revelation still. The  martyred Prophet is still the head of this Church. Every quorum   should stand as you stood in your washings and consecrations  I have been consecrated a spokesman to Joseph and I  was commended to speak for him. The Church is not disorganized  though our head is gone    We may have a diversity of feelings  on this matter. I have been called to be a spokesman unto  Joseph and I want to build up the Church unto him and  if the people want me to sustain this place I want it upon  the principle that every individual shall acknowledge it for  himself.    I propose to be a Guardian to the people  In this I have discharged my duty and done what God has  commanded me and the people can please themselves  whether they accept me or not" 
 President Brigham Young said, "I do not care who  leads the Church even though it were Ann Lee; but one thing  I must know and that is what God says about it. I have   the Keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God on  the subject    I know there are those in our midst who  will seek the lives of the Twelve as they did the lives of Joseph  and Hyrum. We shall ordain others and give the fulness  of the Priesthood so that if we are killed the fulness of the   priesthood may remain.    Joseph confered upon our heads all the  keys and powers belonging to the Apostleship which he  himself held before he was taken away and no man or  set of men can get between Joseph and the Twelve in  this world or in the world to come    How often has Joseph said to the Twelve  I have laid the foundation and you must build thereon  for upon your shoulders the kingdom rests    The Twelve as a quorum will not be  permitted to tarry here long. They will go abroad and  bear off the kingdom to the nations of the earth and baptize  the people faster than mobs can kill them off. I would  like were it my privilege to take my valise and travel and  preach until we had a people gathered who would be true    My private feelings would be to let   the affairs of men and women alone & only go and preach  and baptize them into the kingdom of God; yet whatever  duty God places upon me in His strength I intend to fulfill  it.    I want to see this people with the various quorums  of the Priesthood assemble together in Special Conference  on Tuesday next at 10 oclock a.m." (which was carried  unanimously by vote) 
 At the request of William Marks who was  then Presiding over the Stake a special meeting was held next  morning at 10 o'clock to choose a Guardian or President and  Trustee. Sidney Rigdon took his position in a waggon  about two rods in front of the stand and harangued the  Saints for about an hour and a half upon chosing a  Guardian for the Church. The meeting was then dismissed  when President Brigham Young gave out an appointment  for the brethren to assemble at 2 o'clock    At the appointed time the brethren  came together. Present of the Twelve -- Brigham Young  Heber C. Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt Willard  Richards Wilford Woodruff and George A Smith  The several quorums were organized on and around the   stand according to order.    The meeting being opened President  Brigham Young arose and said, Attention all!  This congregation makes me think of the days of king   Benjamin the multitude being so great that all could  not hear. I request the brethren not to have any feelings  for being convened this afternoon for it is necessary. We  want you all to be still and give attention that all may  hear. Let none complain because of the situation of  the congregation. We will do the best we can    For the first time in my life, -- for the  first time in your lives, for the first time in the  kingdom of God in the nineteenth century without a  prophet at our head do I step forth to act in my calling  in connection with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostles  of Jesus Christ unto this generation--Apostles whom  God has called by revelation through the Prophet Joseph  who are ordained and anointed to bear off the keys of   the kingdom of God in all the world. 
 This people have hitherto walked by sight and not by  faith. You have had the prophet in your midst. Do you all  understand? You have walked by sight and without much  pleading to the Lord to know whether things were right or not.  Heretofore you have had a prophet as the mouth of the Lord to  speak to you, but he has sealed his testimony with his blood;  and now for the first time are you called to walk by faith and  not by sight.    The first position I take in behalf of the Twelve   and the people is to ask a few questions. I ask the Latter-  day Saints, do you as individuals at this time want to  choose a prophet or a guardian? Inasmuch as our Prophet   and Patriarch are taken from our midst do you want  some one to guard to guide and lead you through this  world into the kingdom of God or not? All that want  some person to be a guardian or a prophet a spokesman  or something else signify it by raising the right hand  [text enclosed in box] No votes [end text box]    When I came to this stand I had peculiar  feelings and impressions. The faces of this people  seemed to say we want a shepherd to guide and lead us  through this world. All who want to draw away  a party from the Church after them let them do it  if they can but they will not prosper    If any man thinks he has influence among  this people to lead away a party let him try it and he  will find out that there is power with the Apostles which   will carry them off victorious through all the world and  build up and defend the Church and kingdom of God    What do the people want? I feel as  though I wanted the privilege to weep and mourn for  thirty days at least, then rise up shake myself  and tell the people what the Lord wants of them 
 Although my heart is too full of mourning to launch forth into  business transactions and the organization of the Church I feel   compelled this day to step forth in the discharge of those duties  God has placed upon me    I now wish to speak of the organization  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If the  Church is organized and you want to know how it is   organized I will tell you. I know your feelings. Do   you want me to tell your feelings?    Here is President Rigdon who was Counselor  to Joseph. I ask, where are Joseph and Hyrum?  They are gone beyond the veil and if Elder Rigdon wants  to act as his counselor he must go beyond theveil where   he is    There has been much said about President  Rigdon being President of the Church and leading the  people, -- being the head &c &c. Brother Rigdon has  come 1600 miles to tell you what he wants to do for  you. If the people want President Rigdon to lead them  they may have him; but I say unto you that the  quorum of the Twelve have the keys of the kingdom  in all the world    The Twelve are appointed by the finger   of God. Here is Brigham; have his knees ever faltered?  Have his lips ever quivered? Here is Heber and the rest   of the Twelve an independant body who have the  keys of the priesthood -- the keys of the kingdom of  God to deliver to all the world: this is true, so help  me God! They stand next to Joseph and are as the   First Presidency of the Church    I do not know whether my enemies will   take my life or not and I do not care for I want to be  with the man I love. 
 You cannot fill the office of a Prophet Seer and  Revelator: God must do this. You are like children without  a father and sheep without a shepherd. You must not appoint  any man at your head; if you should the Twelve must ordain  him. You cannot appoint a man at your head but if you  do want any other man or men to lead you take them and  we will go our way to build up the kingdom of God in all  the world    I know who are Josephs friends and who are  his enemies. I know where the keys of the kingdom are  and where they will eternally be. You cannot call a man  to be a Prophet; you cannot take Elder Rigdon and place   him above the Twelve; if so he must be ordained by them    I tell you there is an over anxiety to hurry  matters here. You cannot take any man and put him  at the head; You would scatter the Saints to the four   winds; You would sever the Priesthood. So long as we  remain as we are the heavenly head is in constant co-operation  with us; and if you go out of that course God will have  nothing to do with you    Again some perhaps think that our   beloved brother Rigdon would not be honoured-- would not  be looked to as a friend; but if he does right and remains  faithful he will not act against our counsel nor we against  his but act together and we shall be as one    I again repeat, no man can stand  at our head except God reveals it from the heavens. I have  spared no pains to learn any lesson of the kingdom in  this world and in the eternal worlds and if it were not so  I could go and live in peace; but for the gospel and your  sakes I shall stand in my place. We are liable to be  killed all the day long. You have never lived by faith.    Brother Joseph the Prophet has laid 
 the foundation for a great work and we will build upon it: you have never  seen the quroums built one upon another. There is an almightly foundation  laid and we can build a kingdom such as there never was in the  world: we can build a kingdom faster that Satan can kill the  Saints off.    What do you want? Do you want a Patriarch for  the whole Church? To this we are perfectly willing.  If brother  Samuel H Smith had been living it would have been his  right and privilege; but he is dead. He is gone to Joseph and  Hyrum; he is out of the reach of bullets and spears and he  can waft himself with his brothers his friends and the Saints    Do you want a Patriarch? Here is brother William  left; here is uncle John Smith, uncle to the Prophet Joseph left  It is their right. The right of the Patriarchal Priesthood belongs  to Joseph's family.    Do you want a Trustee in Trust? Has there  been a Bishop who has stood in his lot yet? What is his  business? To take charge of the temporal affairs so that  the Twelve and the Elders may go on their business. Joseph  condescended to do their business for them. Joseph  condescended to offer himself for the Presidency of the United  States and it was a great condescension.    Do you want a spokesman? Here  are Elder Rigdon brother Amasa Lyman (whom Joseph  expected to take as a counsellor) and myself. Do you want  the Church properly organized or do you want a spokesman  to be chief cook and bottle washer. Elder Rigdon claims to be  spokesman to the Prophet. Very well, he was; but can  he now act in that office? If he wants now to be a  spokesman to the Prophet he must go to the other side   of the veil for the Prophet is there but Elder Rigdon is here. Why  will Elder Rigdon be a fool? Who knows anything of the Priesthood  or of the organization of the kingdom of God? I am plain. 
 Does the Church want it as God organized it? or do you want to  clip the power of the Priesthood and let those who have the keys go  and build up the kingdom in all the world wherever the people will  hear them?    If there is a spokesman, if he is king and priest let  him go and build up a kingdom unto himself. That is his right. It  is the right of many here; but the Twelve are at the head of it.    I want to live on the earth and spread truth through  all the world. You Saints of Latter-days want things right. If  ten thousand rise up and say they have the Prophet Joseph Smith's  shoes I know they are impostors. In the Priesthood you have  a right to build up a kingdom if you know how the Church  is organized.    Now if you want Sidney Rigdon or William Law  to lead you or anybody else you are welcome to them; but I  tell you in the name of the Lord that no man can put  another between the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph. Why?  Because Joseph was their file leader and he has committed  into their hands the keys of the kingdom in this last   dispensation for all the world. Don't put a thread  between the Priesthood of God    I ask who has stood next to Joseph and Hyrum?  I have; and I will stand next to him. We have a head  and that head is the Apostleship, the spirit and power of   Joseph and we now can begin to see the necessity of that  Apostleship.    Brother Rigdon was at his side--not above.  No man has a right to counsel the Twelve but Joseph Smith  Think of these sayings things. You cannot appoint a Prophet but   if you let the Twelve remain and act in their place the keys  of the kingdom are with them and they can manage the affairs  of the Church and direct all things aright    Now all this does not lessen the character of   
 President Rigdon. Let him magnify his calling and Joseph will  want him beyond the veil. Let him be careful what   he does lest that thread which bind us together be cut assumder  May God bless us all."    Much more was said by Presient Young  which I did not write.    Amasa Lyman said:--I do not arise to electioneer. I am gratified  with the open frank and plain exposition of President Young. He has seen  the relation I bear to my deceased brother. I never did conceive it gave  me precedance to go before the Twelve    I do not make any exceptions to anything he has   said. I believe there is no power or officer or means wanted to  carry on the work but what is in the Twelve. I am satisfied that  no man can carry on the work but the power which is in the Twelve  as has been said    There is one thing to secure the salvation of  this people and that is not in union alone. It is for you to know  the right and be united--it has been presented by President Young  All I design to do is to redeem my pledge    President Young has stood next to the Prophet  Joseph with the Twelve and I have stood next to them and I will  stand next to them. I have been at the back of Joseph Smith and  will be at the back of the Twelve forever and then we will be  saved.    There is no need of a President. We have a head  here. What is that head? The quorum of the Twelve Apostles  are that head. We now see the necessitty of the Apostleship    I might rise up as well as any other man to  ask for the Presidency; but I could not do it without endangering my  salvation. This is the power that turns the key to bestow salvation  through all the land in the way that Joseph commenced it--the   first one called to do the same in all the world. If Joseph  had any power to bear off the kingdom of God the Twelve 
 have the same.    I could not advocate the choosing a President and myself a candidate  so then you know the place I occupy is to stand to the Twelve the same as the  Twelve did to Joseph when on one side or the other. I do not want to go before  them or to fall asleep. I want to see the kingdom roll forth by our united  faith and efforts"    President Rigdon called upon W. W. Phelps to speak in  his behalf as he could not speak himself    W. W. Phelps arose and said:--With the knowledge I have  I cannot but suppose that this congregation will act right this day. I believe  enough has been said to prepare the minds of the people to act    I have known many of them for 14 years and I have  always known them to submit with defference to the authorities of the Church  I have seen the Elders of Israel and the people take their lives in their  hands and go without purse or scrip in winter and in summer I  have seen them prepare for war and ready to pour out their hearts blood  and that is an evidence that they will walk by counsel    I am happy to see this little lake of faces and  to see the same disposition and spirit manifested here today as  it was the day after the bloody tragedy when Joseph and Hyrum  Smith was brought home dead to this city: then you submitted to  the law's slow delay and handed the matter over to God. And  I see the same thing here today. You are now determined as  one man to sustain the authorities of the Church and I am happy  that the men who were on Joseph's right and left hand submit  themselves to the authority of the Priesthood.    I have feelings about this especially for President  Rigdon and I want to say that there is a quorum that the Twelve   belong to and that the people will receive an endowment. I brought  President Rigdon into that quorum and he receved in part the blessings. I  could not bear the thought of President Rigdon going into the world  he did receive part and I hope he will submit    I want Brother Amasa Lyman to stand on 
 the side of the Twelve and they are wanted there still. let them go  on and sustain them in that high office. You cannot put in a  guardian of the Church    We have hitherto walked by sight and if any man  wanted to know anything he had only to go to brother Joseph.  Joseph is gone but he has not left us comfortless    I want to say that brother Joseph came and  enlightened me two days after he was burried: he came to me the  same as when he was alive and in a moment appeared to me in  his own house. He said tell the drivers to drive on. I asked  if the building was on wheels?  He said certainly. I spoke and away it went. We drove all  round the hills and valleys. He then told the drivers to drive  on over the hill into town. I told him Devil Creek was before  us. He said drive over Devil Creek; I dont care for Devil Creek  or any other creek, and we did so; then I awoke.    There is a combination of persons in this city who  are in continual intercourse with William and Wilson Law who are  at the bottom of the matter to destroy all that stand for Joseph  and there are persons now in this city who are only wanting power  to murder all who still stand for him; but let us go ahead and  build up the Temple and then you will be endowed: when the  Temple is compleated all the honourable mothers in Israel will  be endowed as well as the Elders.    If they want to do right uphold the Twelve;  If they die I am willing to die with them: but do your duty  and you will be endowed. I will sustain the Twelve as long as I  have breath.    When Joseph was going away he said he was going  to die and I said I was willing to die with him; but as I am now  alive as a lawyer in Israel I am determined to live    I want you all to recolect that Joseph and   Hyrum have only been removed from the earth and they now  counsel and converse with the Gods beyond the reach of powder 
 and ball.    Parley P. Pratt remarked: What has been said has been well  said. If there are men here who are our enemies I tell you when they will  cease to be here: they will be here while you will deal with them. If I  exchange property or deal with men I do it with those whom I know to be  faithful    If there are wicked men here it is because we support them  Stop dealing with them and they will go away. Will I support them?  No; I would deal with all honest men whom I know to be such.    I am willing to do good to all men especially  to the household of faith. Our enemies will cease to dwell here when  you cease to deal with them. Mobs and wicked men will cease  when you cease to support them. I know we can all live and  be happy too when we deal with honest men. If a man wants  a doctor or a lawyer he will send directly for the worst man he can  find. I would die a natural death sooner than I would have  a wicked doctor to help me off. I would go without sueing all  the days of my life before I would go to a lawyer to sue. I will  not say anything about the merchants because you all know them    President Brigham Young again arose and said:  "There is more business than can be done this afternoon but we can  accomplish all we want to have done without without calling  this convention of the whole Church. I am going to present to  you the leading items    I do not ask you to take my counsel or advise  alone but every one of you act for yourself; but if brother Rigdon  is the person you want to lead you vote for him but not  unless you intend to follow him and support him as  you did Joseph. Do not say so unless you mean to  take his counsel hereafter    And I would say the same for the  Twelve. Dont make a covenant to support them unless  you intend to abide by their counsel and if they do not 
 counsel you as you please dont turn round and oppose them.    I want every man before he enters into a  covenant to know what he is going to do; but we want to know  if this people is going to support the Priesthood. In the name  of Israel's God if you say you will, do so    We want men appointed to take charge of  the business that did lay on the shoulders of Joseph. Let  me say to you that this kingdom will spread more than ever  The Twelve have the power now the Seventies the Elders and  all of you can have power to go and build up the kingdom  in the name of Israel's God.    Nauvoo will not hold all the people who   will come into the kingdom. We want to build the Temple  so as to get our endowment and if we do our best and Satan  will not let us build it we will go into the wilderness and  we will receive the endowment for we will receive an  endowment anyhow    Will you abide our counsel? I again  say my soul for any man's if they will abide our counsel  that they will go right into heaven. We have all the signs  and tokens to give to the porter at the door and he will let us  in    I ask you as quorums do you want Bro  Rigdon to stand forward as your leader your guide your  spokesman. President Rigdon wants me to bring up  the other question first and that is does the Church want and  is it their ownly desire to sustain the Twelve as the First Presidency  of this people?    Here are the Apostles the Bible the Book of  Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants they are written on the  tablet of my heart. If the Church want the Twelve to   stand as the head--the First Presidency of the Church and at  the head of this kingdom in all the world stand next to Joseph   
 walk up unto their calling and hold the keys of this kingdom every man  every woman every quorum is now put in order and you are now the  sole controllers of it.    All who are in favour of this in all the congregation of  the Saints manifest it by holding up the right hand. There was   a universal vote. If there are any of the contrary mind--every   man and every woman who does not want the Twelve to preside  lift up your hands in like manner. No hands up. This  supersedes the other question and trying it by quorums    We feel as though we could take brother  Rigdon in our bosom along with us. We want such men as  brother Rigdon. He has been sent away by brother Joseph to  build up a kingdom. Let him keep the instructions and  calling; let him raise up a mighty kingdom in Pittsburg  and we will lift up his hands to Almighty God. I think  we may have a printing office and a gathering there. If  the devil still trys to kill us he will have enough to do.    The next is President Marks. Our feelings  is to let him stand as President of the Stake as heretofore  We can build the Temple &c.    You did not know who you had amongst  you. Joseph so loved this people that he gave his life for  them. Hyrum loved his brother and this people unto death  Joseph and Hyrum have given their lives for the Church.  But very few knew Joseph's character. He loved you unto   death. You did not know it until after his death. He has  now sealed his testimony with his blood    If the Twelve had been here we would  not have seen him given up. He should not have been given   up. He was in your midst but you did not kow him  He has been taken away for the people are not worthy of  him    The world is wide. I can preach in England 
 Ireland Scotland France Germany &c; I can preach in all the world and  the devils cannot find us. I will sware to you I will not   be given up.    There is much to be done. You have   men among you who sleep with one eye open. The foundation  is laid by our Prophet and we will build thereon. No other  foundation can be laid but that which is laid and we will  have our endowment if the Lord will    As the authorities do not want us to do  military duty dont do it. If it is necessary my kneck  is ready for the knife. As for myself I am determined  to build up the kingdom of God and by the bye there will  be a gleaning of grapes and it may be said "to your tents  O Israel"    We can build on the foundation which  was laid by the Prophet. Joseph has finished his work  and all the Devils in hell and all the mobers on earth could  not take his life until he had accomplished his work. God  said I will put a veil over his eyes and lead him up  to the slaughter like a sheep to be killed for the people  are not worthy of him though God loves this people    Let no man suppose that the kingdom  is rent from you that it is not organized. If all the quorums of  the Church were slain except the High Priest they would rise up  with the keys of the kingdom and have the power of the Priesthood  upon them and build up the kingdom and the devil cannot  help himself    You can go to a healthy country buy the land  and dont let a cursed scoundrel get in your midst. Let there be  good men good women and whenever a man comes with a wheelbarrow  full of goods dont let him land dont let him a house or buy   of him    Suppose we had ten thousand such places and 
 increasing in greatness perfectly free from these poor devils we should feel  better than we do now. Let us all be humble and get our endowments  all be humble industrious and prudent what sort of a kingdom would it  be? The foundation is laid for more than we can think or talk  about today    Is it the will of this congregation that they will  be theth tithed until the Temple is finished as they have heretofore been?  If so signify it by the uplifted hand {The vote was unanimous}    The men will act who never acted before  and they will have the power and authority to do it. Is it the  minds of the congregation to loose the hands of the Twelve and  enable us to go and preach to all the world? We want to know  the feelings of the people. Is it your will to support the Twelve  in all the world in their missions. {The congregation susttained  this question by a unanimous vote} Will you leave it to  the Twelve to dictate about the finances of the Church and will  it be the mind of this people that the Twelve teach what will  be the duties of the Bishops in handling the affairs of the  Church. I want this because Twelve men can do it just as  well as calling this immense congregation together at any other  time {A unanimous vote}    We shall have a Patriarch and the  right is in the family of Joseph Smith--his brothers his sons  or some ones of his relations. Here is Uncle John he has  been ordained a Patriarch. Brother Samuel would have  taken the office had he been alive. It would have been  his right. The right is in Uncle John or one of his brothers  {read Doctrine and Covenants sec III Par 17} I know that it would  have belonged to Samuel but as it is if you leave it to the  Twelve they will wait until they know who is the man  Will you leave it to the Twelve and they dictate in the  matter {unanimous vote} I know it will be let alone for the  present. 
 I feel to bring up brother Rigdon. We are of  one mind with him and he with us. Will this congregation uphold  him in the place he occupies by the prayer of faith and let him  be one with us and we with him {unanimous} The Twelve will   dictate and see to other matters. There will be a committee  for the Temple and now let men stand to their posts and  be faithful"    The Conference adjourned to Oct, the 6th with  the Benediction from Elder Parley P. Pratt.    The next day I attended a council and we  appointed two Trustees in Trust for the Church--namely George Miller  and N. K. Whitney    Nauvoo at this juncture of our Church  history was seeing gloomy times. The Prophet and Patriarch was  gone from us and there was but little ambition in the people  for a time to do anything though they were very busy working  on the Temple.    A  Council of the Twelve    Monday August the 12th    Present: Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball Parley  P. Pratt Orson Pratt Willard Richards Wilford Woodruff  John Taylor and George A Smith    Voted: That Amasa Lyman is one of the Twelve Apostles    Voted: That the Estate of Joseph Smith settle its own  debts and the Church have nothing to do with it    Voted To organize the Continant of America into districts 
 and to appoint High Priests to preside over each    Voted: That Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards  district the continant of America and appoint Presidents over the several  districts."    The meeting adjourned till 1 o'clock and met again  at 3.    Moved by Heber C. Kimball that Elder Wilford Woodruff  take a mission to England and preside over the Church and printing  establishment in England Ireland Scotland and the adjacent Isles and  continant. {Carried}    Voted: That the general superintendance direction and control  of the emigration in England be at the disposal of Brigham  Young President of the Quorum of the Twelve.    Brigham Young President of the Council  Willard Richards Clerk.    Sunday the 18th a vast congregation of the saints  assembled at the grove to hear a discourse from President Young  upon the excitement then prevailing in Nauvoo in consequence  of some trying to draw away parties after them    Discourse of President Brigham Young    (synopsis from my Journal)    I have many things to speak of. It was  my mind in the first place that we should have suitable time  to meditate upon all matters and weigh them even every subject  wherin we felt interested. When the question was asked me if 
 they should continue to baptize for the dead I said I had no counsel to  give upon that subject at present but should think it not best to attend  to it at that time    I have learned some things I did not know  when I came home. I discover a disposition in the sheep to  scatter abroad now the Shepherd is taken away. I do not say  that it will never be right for this people to go from here or scatter  abroad but let them wait until the time comes and until they  get counsel to do so    The report has gone through the city   that the Twelve have secret understanding with those men  who are going away and taking companies with them that  they shall take all they can and that although the Twelve will  blow it up yet privately they wish it to go on but if it was  the last words I had to say before going into the eternal world  I would sware by the Holy Trinity that it is utterly false and  and not one word of truth in it. There is no man who has any  right to lead away one soul out of this city by the consent of the  Twelve except Lyman Wight and George Miller who have had  the privilege of taking the Pine Company where they pleased  but not another soul has the consent of the Twelve to go  with them    There is no man who has any liberty  to lead away people into the wilderness from this Church or  to lead them anywhere else by the consent of the Twelve or the  Church except the case above named and I tell you in the  name of Jesus Christ that if Lyman Wight and George Miller  take a course contrary to our counsel and will not act in  concert with us they will be damned and go to destruction  If men will not stop striving to be great and exalted and  lead away parties from us and striving to weaken our  hands they will fall and not rise again and I will destroy  their influence in this Church with the help of God and 
 my brethren. I wish you to distinctly understand that the counsel of  the Twelve is for every family that does not belong to the Pine Company   to stay here in Nauvoo build up the Temple and get their endowment  Dont scatter. United we stand divided we fall.    It has been whispered about that all who go  into the wilderness with Wight and Miller will get their endowment  but they cannot give an endowment in the wilderness. If we  do not carry out the plan laid down by Joseph and the pattern  he has given for us to work by we cannot get any further  endowment. I want it to sink deep into your hearts that  you may remember it. I repeat it. Let me reason with you  If you stir up the flame of dissent will you get an endowment? No.  You get a party to run here and another there and divide our strength  and weaken our hands and we shall be left and our enemies will flock  around us and destroy us. In that case you will not get your  endowment but will sink and not rise--go to hell and not to the bosom  of Abraham    Do the people leave here because they are  affraid? Do you fear those who have power to kill the body  If you leave this place for fear of mob before God tells you to go  you will have no place of rest but you will flee from place to  place and go like the Jews until God raises up some other  people to redeem you for if the Devil scares you from this  place he will scare you from all other places.    Let no man go from this place but the  Pine Company brethren but stay here sow plant & build. Put in your  plowshares into the praries. One plowshare will do more to  drive off the mob than two guns. Let us stay here  where the bones of Joseph and Hyrum Samuel Don Carlos  and Father Smith are. Joseph has said if I am slain  in battle or fall in any way I want my body laid in  Nauvoo. I had rather have the dead body of the Prophet  than some men who are alive and I should rather have  the clothes of the Prophet stuffed with straw for President 
 of the United States than any man whose name is now before  the [text changes to pencil] nation [text changes back to ink] for a candidate for he would not do as much harm   We want to build the Temple in this place. If we have to build   it as the Jews built the walls of the Temple in Jerusalem  with a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. How  easily some men are scared. I have never been frightened  yet and I know other men who have not    Do you suppose the mouth of God   is closed to be opened no more unto us. If this was so I  would not give the ashes of a rie straw for the salvation  of the Church. If God has ceased to speak by the  Holy Ghost or revelation there is no salvation; but this is not  the case    There seems to be a disposition manifested  by many to leave Nauvoo and go into the wilderness or  somewhere else. But what if we should go into the  wilderness and we should ask God to give us an  endowment and he should ask us if we were driven   from Nauvoo and who drove us. The Devil  drove us would be the answer. "Well" he might   say "did you not know that I had power over the  devil" Yes; but one said "I would not give a Jack  knife for all Nauvoo and another said I would not  give a pair of mules for the best farm in Hancock County  & I was affraid.    Would the Lord give an endowment to   a people who was frightened away from their duty  These who are wishing to lead away parties contrary to counsel  I would not wish them damned worse than to have a company  after their own likeing for they will soon quaral among  themselves    If we should go into the wilderness  and ask the Lord to give us an endowment he might ask  us saying "Did I not give you rock in Nauvoo to 
 build the Temple with?"    "Yes."    "Did I not through my Providence furnish men to quarry  and cut the stone and prepare it for the building"    "Yes."    "Did I not give you means to build the Temple there?    "Yes."    "Very well, had you died in Nauvoo on the walls  of the Temple or in your fields I would have taken you to   myself and raised up men to officiate for you and you would  have enjoyed the highest glory. Did you make a  sacrifice by tithing?    "No"    "Well I dont wonder you did not believe I had power over the   devil."    Such may go away. But I want to have  the faithful stay here and settle this city. We shall require the  truth of all your property as the tithing for the building of the Temples  for the poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and living by  the Church hereafter so that I can give my whole time to the  buisness of the Church. I have always supported myself heretofore  in all my travels and labours    While in England in one year we circulated 60,000  tracts upon our doctrine. This ought to be done in all the world and  it can be where the Elders are faithful to their calling    Joseph the Testator has been preserved till  now but he has now sealed his testimony with his blood and his testament  should be put in force. While the Testator lived it was all in his own  hands but now he is dead    There is no remission of sins without the sheding  of blood. You will soon wake up and know things as they are  There has been a great debt paid. There will be no need of more  blood of the saints being shed at present. By and by you will 
 understand and see that all is right    Wo! Wo! Wo! unto all who have shed the blood of the   Saints and the Lord's Anointed. It must needs be that offences  come but wo unto them by whom they come    To those who want to go away from this  place I would say wait until the time comes. I will give you  the key. North and South America is Zion and as soon as  the Temple is done and you get your endowment you can go and   build up stakes but dont be in haste. Wait until the Lord  says, go.    If you have the Spirit of God you can discern  right from wrong. When all is right in the Priesthood and a man  rises up and speaks in the Spirit of God and just right all will  say Amen; but when a man rises up and talks as smooth as   oil if he is not right there will be many queries about it. It will  not edify the body. I give this as a key    You may go all over North and South America  [text changes to pencil] ^and build up stakes^ [text reverts to ink] when the time comes. The whole continant of America must be  organized into Districts and presiding Elders appointed over  each district. The time has come when all things must  be set in order. I have had these things upon my mind all  long time. The time has come now for bickering to cease  There must be a strict order of things and we are no longer bound  to harbor blacklegs counterfeiters & bogus makers. We know  all about them. They have been in our midst long enough. I  advise all the Saints to have no dealing with such men. Let  them alone. The time has come that they should be whiped  out of our midst. Let those men alone--let the ungodly  dealers alone. And as to the Doctors who are in our midst  who are our enemies I would say let them alone also for I have  no doubt that three to one who have died in this place had a  doctor    And I would say wo unto you lawyers 
 for your whole study is to put down truth and put a lie in its stead. I want  the lawyers to know that we have common sense. They want to make  you believe that when you spell baker you mean cider or wiskey  Now let the Doctors and Lawyers alone and leave off bitterness and  evil speaking and you will build the Temple and get an endowment  All you lawyers go away and let us alone and when we get full of the  devil and want you we will send for you. We may then have a  more convenient season    I want to say to the Saints do not harbour  blacklegs counterfeiters & bogus makers. Wipe them away. It is time  to carry out the design of our Prophet. Do cease to employ doctors  lawyers and merchants who will use your plurse and then mob  you. Store your grain in Nauvoo for you will want it  there to eat while you are building the Temple    I want to say to the hands upon the Temple  be united and to the Committee I would say dont turn away any  person because he is an Englishman Scotchman Irishman or any other  nation but employ every man you can and build the Temple and  your homes.    I would rather pay out every cent to build up  this place and get an endowment even if I was driven the next minute  without anything to take with me.    As to the doctors let them go. I can prove  that a doctor in this place doctored a woman who was in the family way  and he did not know it until she was delivered and both the woman  and child died and if you employ them you will all die; but the  time has come when you need no longer support them    There is a distinction between the law of  the land and the law of the Church. You have the privilege of  keeping all shops that does not come in contact with the law of the  the State County or City so I will evade the law says the dealer  and give away wiskey and sell a little tobaco or something else  and charge enough for both but the law of the Church will reach 
 such men if they are members for they will be cut off.    I had a dream which I will here relate.   I saw a fruit tree and I went into the tree to search for fruit. I  soon descovered that some of the main branches on the top growing  from the main body was dead. It seamed necessary to cut  off the dead branches in order to save the tree. So I told  some person to help me cut them off and he steped on to a large  green limb. They were affraid it would break so I put my   shoulder under it and held it up while he cut off the dead  branches. It cracked the green limb but it did not break  After we cut off the dead branches the wound healed up and  the tree grew finely    Now let us cut off the dead branches  of the Church that good fruit may grow and the voice will  soon be heard go and build Zion and the great Temple of   the Lord.    A word unto the Seventies. They will  be organized into their different quorums and a presidency of  of seven men will be chosen out of the first seventy to preside  over each quorum    Now as you have been warned let   every man warn his neighbour and we will give every man  his appointment as soon as convenient    May the Lord bless you in the name  of Jesus Christ Amen.    In the afternoon the assembly was again  addressed in a simlar strain by Heber C. Kimball and  President Young but I was at home writing and hence  did not take notes; and in the evening in company with  Mrs Woodruff I rode out to bro John Benbows and spent the  night. We came to the conclusion to leave our only son  Wilford with brother and Sister Benbow while I took 
 my mission to England accompanied by my wife    Returning the next day I met in Council with the Twelve  We conversed concerning the route we should take and it was thought that  the northern route would be the healthiest. Among other things some  dreams were rehearsed. The following was told by myself:    "I met with Joseph Smith in the congregation  of the Saints. He had his old Hebrew and German Bible and preached  to the Saints but he seamed to be too thronged by the people and he  rose up lifted up a curtain and passed into another room where the  people could not disturb him and there he was going to teach  the people.    The following is from the hand of Brigham  Young.    Certificate    "I hereby certify that Elder Wilford Woodruff has received  a mission by order of the quorum of the Twelve to England to  preside over the Churches in that land and I feel to bless him  in the name of the Lord with all belonging to or dwelling  beneath his roof at this time consisting of his wife and  children and sister Mary            who is assisting them  to get on their journey.    Brigham Young    On the 23rd I visited Emma Smith the  widow of the Prophet. She let me have a piece of oak  for a staff out of the coffin of the martyred Joseph. She  also let me have a pair of white cotton gloves a  [changes to pencil] nd [changes back to ink] Mrs. Woodruff a  pocket [inserted in pencil] cotton [change back to ink] handkerchief both of which were [unclear] [inserted in pencil] worn [change back to ink] by the Prophet while  living    We called upon Sister Mary Smith widow  of Hyrum the Patriarch and she gave us some hair from 
 the heads of Joseph, Hyrum Samuel and Don Carlos Smith all  brothers and the same parents. I also obtained some hair of the  quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints. My intention in obtaining the hair was that  I might put a portion of each in the knob of my staff as a relick  of those noble men--the master Spirits of the nineteenth century    I next visited Mother Lucy Smith the  parent of Joseph--the Lord's Anointed--and of Hyrum Samuel  and Don Carlos, and the wife of Joseph the First Patriarch of  the last dispensation all of whom directly or indirectly fell martyrs  for the cause of God. The old Mother and Prophetess felt  most heart broken at the loss of her children and from the wicked  and cruel treatment she had received from the hands of the  world. She beg[g]ed a blessing at my hand. I laid my  hands upon her head and by the Spirit of God proclaimed  the following--    Blessing  of  Mother Lucy Smith  under the hands of Wilford Woodruff  on the 23 of August 1844    Beloved Mother in Israel    According to your request I lay  my hands upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth  and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the keys of the kingdom  of God to bestow a blessing upon you for thou are worthy of  all blessings    As I laid my hands upon thy husband  Joseph the Senior, the Patriarch of the Church by his request  to bless him as he lay upon his bed like Jacob of old ready  to gather up his feet and sleep with his fathers and I about 
 to take my departure for foreign nations over the sea which was the last time  we met on earth in like manner do I esteem it a blessing and privelege to  lay my hands upon your head in your decline of life to leave with you  my parting blessing    I am again called to bid farewell to my native  land and visit foreign climes to bear record of the words of God. We may  never meet again on earth but I thank my God that I have this  privilege of blessing thee for thou art the Greatest Mother in  Israel. The sons which thou hast borne and cherished are the  most noble spirits that ever graced humanity or tabernacled in the  flesh. Their work shall be had in honourable remembrance  throughout all generations. Though counted among transgressors  they like the Messiah have shed their blood for the sins of  the people and freely offered their lives and sealed their testimony  [changes to pencil] with their blood.    [changes back to ink] Thou hast lived to see the fall of thy   sons by the rage of Gentile hands but like an eternal rock in  the midst of the ocean thou has stood and God has given thee  the desire of thy heart in seeing the keys of this kingdom  held in the hands of thy posterity so planted on the earth  that they shall never be taken from it until He reigns whose  right it is to reign    Let thy heart be comforted in the midst  of thy sorrow for thou shalt be had in honourable remembrance  forever in the congregations of the righteous. Thou shalt be  remembered in thy wants during the remainder of thy days and  when thou art called to depart thou canst lie down in peace  having seen the salvation of God in laying an everlasting  foundation for the deliverance of Israel through the instrumentality  of thy sons    I seal upon your head all the blessings   of the fulness of the gospel of the "First Born" and all  those blessings which have been sealed upon your head  heretofore. If we meet no more on earth we shall meet 
 in the morn of the first resurrection when you shall receive thrones  and powers and dominion and kingdom with thy husband in his  exaltation in the lineage of his fathers.    I seal these blessings upon your head  in the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy  Priesthood: Amen.    Set Apart For My Mission  (Nauvoo August 24 1844)    The following blessing was confered upon my head and  I was set apart by the Twelve for my mission to England to take  charge of all the Churches in Europe. Elder John Taylor was   mouthpiece for the quorum    Brother Woodruff, We lay our hands  upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ and by the  authority of the Holy Priesthood to seal upon your head a  blessing and set you apart unto the important mission which  is appointed unto you of the Lord by the voice of the Twelve  to go over the sea to England to take charge of the churches  throughout that land; and we ask God the Eternal Father  in the name of Jesus Christ to bless you with health  and strength open the door before you and your family  that you may have food and rament and money and all things  necessary to make you comfortable and that the power of God may  rest upon you in a greater degree than in any mission  before. We seal upon your head these blessings. You shalt  be preserved to finish your mission and return home with your  family and meet in the Temple of the Lord and rejoice therein  and shout Hosanna. You shall have power and wisdom to  accomplish the design of your missions and shall have the desire  [changes to pencil]^of your heart^ [changes back to ink] given you in all things in righteousness before God." 
 The next day was Sunday and I was called upon to  address the congregation of Saints assembled in Nauvoo as I was about to leave  for my mission to England. The following is a few of the items I presented  to the people in my discourse    "There is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty  giveth it understanding. It is through this principle that this congregation is  assembled together at this place. You had understanding of the things of God  and His Spirit. [changes to pencil] by the Spirit of God]    [changes back to ink] I have now one important declaration to make to you  and that is that inasmuch as you will be invited in heart and mind and  in action in supporting your counsellors--the priesthood of God--the  authorities of the Church and follow the counsel given you as you  have endeavoured to follow the counsel of the Prophet while he was living   you will be safe and blessed and will prosper but if you are divided and  reject the counsel of God you will fall. Union and faithfulness is your  salvation. It is true you have been led by one of the best men that  ever graced humanity or tabernacled in the flesh but he is gone; he  has sealed [h]is testimony with his blood. He loved this people unto death.    I would now call upon this people to be  united in building up [inserted in pencil] on [end of insertion] the foundation which the Prophet Joseph has  laid. You have been called to suffer much in the cause in which  you are engaged but if judgement begins at the house of God Babylon will  not escape and if there is a fire in a green tree a dry tree will not  escape. There is no people [inserted in pencil] more [end of insertion] prepared for the shock that is coming  on the earth than [inserted in pencil] the [end of insertion] Latter-day Saints. The object we have is to  secure blessings beyond the veil in the first resurrection. This  is what we are preparing for.    Again I would say let not the Saints be  troubled because they have lost their Prophet. I would ask because  the Prophet has sealed his testimony with his blood does that destroy  the gospel or take away the power of God. Is truth annihalated  or has the priesthood found a burying place? I tell you nay  His testimony is now in force. Therefore my counsel is to 
 follow the example of those who have gone before and be faithful unto  death. If you will be united and go to with your whole mights  in building that Temple you have power to accomplish it and  get an endowment"    I earnestly exhorted them to faithfulness and  requested their prayers in my  behalf and asked forgiveness of any  thing which I might have done wrong and bid the congregation  farewell    Joseph Gave the Keys of the Kingdom to the Twelve    I was followed by President Brigham Young  Also Elders P. P. Pratt and Orson Hyde spoke and testified that  Joseph the Prophet had ordained anointed and appointed the Twelve  to lead the church and had given them the keys of the kingdom for  that purpose. W. W. Phelps and R Cahoon bore testimony  that Joseph said unto the Twelve "Upon your shoulders the  kingdom of God must rest in all the world. Now round up  your shoulders and bear it."    Many important things were spoken by the  brethren at this time which I had not the leasure to write    Next day I went to the river with Mrs  Woodruff to be baptized for some of our [inserted in pencil] dead [end of insertion] friends. I was administered  to under the hands of Elder G. A Smith as proxy for five of my  family. I also baptized by wife for five of her friends. Willard  Richards confirmed us.    On the Temple at Midnight    After preparing for my departure bidding farewell  to the Saints and blessing many until midnight of the 27th  in company with Brother and Sister Smoot and Hannah  Ells my wife and I walked to the Temple of the Lord in  Nauvoo. As we approached we lifted up our eyes to  view the sacred scene which the silver moon illuminated  with the brightness of her glory. After gazing a few 
 moments upon her walls and her capitols which were standing upon the ground  completed we all as of one accord ascended the ladders on to the top of the walls:  several of the police and friends followed our example among whom was General  Richard and Elder Godard.    We repared to the southwest corner of the Temple and there  we bowed our knees upon the top corner stone which was prepared to receive its  capitol and thenre with uplifted hands towards heaven I called upon the God  of Abraham Isaac and Jacob; offering the gratitude of our hearts for preserving  our lives and giving us power to so far build the Temple; praying that it  might be finished and the Saints receive their endowments to plant the work of  God in all the earth; asking the Father for a just reckoning for the shedding  of the blood of the Lord's Anointed; praying Him to enable us to fulfil our mission  and return to the bosom of the Church; invoking a double portion of the Spirit of  Joseph to rest upon Brigham and the Twelve to bear off the Kingdom in all the   world and for the power of the priesthood to rest upon all the quorums and Elders  of Israel and dedicating myself family and all belonging to me in the name  of Jesus Christ unto the Lord God.    After prayers we descended and returned to our homes  with joy and peace in our hearts.    Letter of Appointment    Nauvoo August 26th 1844  To All Elders and Saints in Europe Greeting:    We send our beloved brother Wilford Woodruff  to England to take charge of all business transactions pertaining to the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both spiritual and temporal  We wish you to give dilligent heed to his counsel in all things and as we  have not the opportunity of informing you of what has transpired this  season, by letter, our beloved brother will make known unto you all things    We wish the brethren to be faithful and dilligent  in keeping all the commandments of God and in hearkening to the counsels  of those who are sent to counsel them. Let no man or set of men think 
 they have power or authority or the keys of the kingdom above the Apostle  Wifford Woodruff whom we send unto you to instruct you in the things  pertaining to life and salvation    Though our Prophet be slain for the word of G[o]d  and the testimony of Jesus yet the keys of the kingdom remain in the  Church and the heavens are not closed neither is the mouth of the Almighty  sealed up that he cannot speak. The God of Israel will communicate to  his disciples all things necessary for the building up of his kingdom upon  the earth until Israel is gathered: yea even all the blood of Abraham scattered  over all the earth Zion established Jerusalem rebuilt and the whole earth  be filled with the glory and knowledge of God    We wish all the Saints in England to  continue their gathering as usual to the land of America and they  may have the privilege of appointing a committee to visit the land   of America to prepare a location for a settlement of the brethren from  Europe according to their desire under the direction and counsel of Elder  Wilford Woodruff    And further we would say unto the Saints  in all the world that may be visited by Elder Wilford Woodruff that  inasmuch as they will hearken unto his counsel they shall be blessed;  inasmuch as they shall render him any assistance in his mission  they will be doing the will of God and shall not lose their reward. And  we desire that all Saints may use their efforts to sustain him in this  important mission which he is called to fulfil by their faith prayers  and brotherly love according to the grace of God for he is quallified to  teach in all things pertaining to the church and kingdom of God  established in these last days.    Therefore dear brethren we would say unto you  [inserted in pencil] in [end of insertion] conclusion be humble and faithful and hearken dilligently unto the counsel  of this our beloved brother in the Lord Elder Wilford Woodruff and  the blessing of God will attend you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen    Brigham Young President of the Twelve  Willard Richards Clerk 
 Leaves Nauvoo for England    On the 28th I parted with the quorum of the Twelve ^at the Temple^ and started on  my mission. Our company consisted of myself wife and two children Hiram  Clark and wife and Cap. Dan Jones and wife and three brethren who came  with their teams to convey us to Chicago where we arrived on the 7th of  the next month, September; and on the next day we went on board the propell [page damaged]  Oswego to journey up the lakes on our way east    We arrived with a fair breeze at the Manatow [Manitou]  Islands at 12 o clock at noon and spent three hours there. With Mrs Woodruff  I walked over the same beach that we walked over together after being wrecked  on the Chesapeak in Sep 1841. It brought the scene fresh to our minds  We wrote on some smooth stones concerning our wreck and our mission  to England, our names dates &c.; and at three o clock we left the Island  and continued our journey.    Cry of Fire at Midnight    After leaving Detroit on the morning of the 17th  we sailed well through the day and evening until midnight when a  strong wind arose the lake became rough and the boat rocked badly  and in the midst of it when we we were opposite the Cleveland lighthouse  a cry of Fire Fire Fire rang through the boat by the watch on deck  We immediately leaped from our births in our night clothes and each  one caught a bucket as best he could and I caught a bucket about half  full of water and ran barefoot as I was to the stern of the boat looking  for the fire while some was running up stairs. I leaped into the engine  room and saw the fire in one corner of the stern of the boat. I ran over the  pile of coal and dashed my water into the fire which was not larger than  a half bushel measure at the same time a bucket of water flung by Capt  Davis struck the fire and it was extinguished.    There is nothing more terrible and alarming than the  cry of fire at sea or on any water out of the reach of land. It is far more 
 Thursday, M, May 7 1896.    The meeting of the First Presidency and Apos-  les was held at the Temple at 11 A. M. There were present  Presidents Woodruff, Cannon and Smith; and of the Twelve,  Prest. L. Snow, and Elders F. D. Richards, F. M. Lyman, J. H.  Smith, H. J. Grant, J. W. Taylor and A. H. Cannon.    Elder J. H. Smith reported by letter which was read,  that in company with Prest. Horton D. Haight and his counselor  Moroni Pickett, of the Cassia Stake, he had visited Grouse Creek  and organized a new Bishopric, as follows: David H. Toyn Bishop,  William P. Paskett, and Albert Richins counselors.    Prest. Lorenzo Snow called attention to the form of   baptism used in the Temples on behalf of the dead, in which  the words "for the remission of your sins" was ^were^ interpolated,  being different from the form of baptism for the living.    Preisident Joseph F. Smith sad ^said^ he had noticed in baptiz-  ing a person for health the words were used "for the renewl of   your covanents, the remission of your sins and the restoration  of your health". It was the unanimous sense of the Council  that these forms should be corrected by letter of instructions  to the Temple Presidents.    The question of a successor to Elder Anthon H. Luned  as President of the European Mission was considered, and on  motion of Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon, Elder Rulon S. Wells of the   First Council of Seventies, was selected and appointed to suc-  ceed Elder Lund in that position.    President Cannon thought that the Twelve who were able  to travel could be sent from time to time to visit the various  mission^s,^ instead of being tied down to preside over either of  such missions.    President Cannon reported that the work in the Tonga  Islands was of a most arduous character with very unsatisfactory   results. It appeared that converts in that mission had not   numbered one to ea^c^h missionary. He thought that in conse- 
 June 16 Dear Wifford    I have come down to sister Smith before I milk my cow  lest her letter should be gone to the office to tell you that we are all comfortably well  at present the we have all had very bad colds Susan & Phebe have been quite sick  Sister Eunice health is a little better. I received 5 doll[ar]s. from you from Newark, bought about   4 doll[ar]s. worth of lumber paid Balis one & now brother Webster is at work on the house  the other front room and will go to keeping house by themselves when it is done, we have   not yet got the flooring. O you do not know how much you are wanted to see about  things here, Sister Smith says tell him to come home when Mr. Smith comes, I sup-  pose she has written all the news there is much talk of a mob here but I have not had   the first anxious though about it yet the authorities here demolished the press precisely  according to law so they have left us (the Law party) they tried to land in Madison when  the[y] left here but the inhabitants would ^not^ have them there so they went father on up rthe river  they tried to get some printing done but the editors there told them that they would not   do it for their press was in good repute now. Joseph has hasd a dream about the the Laws  he thought they bound him and cast him and into a pit (or well like Joseph of old but he   made a struggle and got to the top of the well so to look out and he saw a little distance  from him one of them in the grasp of a tiger the other a smake [snake] and they were calling to   him to help them he told them they had tied him and he could not help them a brother soon    [written in upside-down text]  came along and took brother Joseph out. Our garden does very well brother A  Alexander is not going out this season brother Taylor is waiting for Joseph to  say go to him, but there is much excitement here at present and he thinks he had  better wait. (A messenger has beent sent to the governor has gone now) I want to see  you much but had quite as lives you would be away now untill this fuss is over. I   received 2 letters from home by Arthur Milliken saying that Luther would not come untill  Sept. and I think sister Foss not at all I cannot say much to her on mothers account   as she tells me she thinks smother would die almost or quite if she should leave. If you   go to Maine I want you to buy 2 yds dark brown ribbon 1 inch 1/4 wide and give to mother  for me with a kiss and tell her she has not got a child in the world that loves her better  or will do more for her than her wandering Phebe, give my love to them all and   ecept much love yourself P.

 Aug. 30th, 1889.    My dear friend:    I am in receipt of your esteemed favor of the 27th, and am glad  to hear from you and to receive the last number of the "Glacier". You do not  mention your own health nor that of your family; but I presume that you are all well.    I am much obliged to you for reminding us concerning the $800.00  for Sam. I have had it enclosed to Cleo, and sent to your care. I hope it will  reach all right. We feel greatly obliged to you for the trouble you have been at  and sorry that you have been under the necessity of having to remind us of it.    Mrs. Woodruff regrets that she did not see you when you were  here, and hopes that you did not feel offended at her not making her appearance. She  was taking a bath at the time and hoped to see you again, when she would have ex-  plained to you the reason why she did not receive you.    When you come over the next time I hope to be able to give you a  ride in a vehicle and with a team that will please you. Mrs. Woodruff and myself think  you will be gratified to know that your suggestions on this point have been carried  out.    With kind regards to yourself and family, in which my friends  with me join,    I remain, as ever,  Your old friend,    W. Woodruff    ^A Badlam Esq  Montgomery St. San Francisco  Cal^ 
 Salt Lake City,  Feb. 7th, 1884.    Dear Br. Brigham Young:    I have re-  ceived two letters from you  of January 7th & 9, but I have  not been able before now   to answer them. I have  spent only about one Sun-  day per month for the last   two months in Salt Lake.  I left here Dec. 6th and re-  turned Jany 1st; and since   my return I have atten-  ded Conferences in Nephi,  Salt Lake, Box Elder, Logan,  and expect to be in Manti  on the 16th inst. In connec-  tion with my travels I have  had to attend Councils  and keep up my journal  and historical matters, so  it has been hard work 
 quence ^o^f the indifference tof the people there to the Gospel,  the missionaries should be withdrawn. This was fully endorsed  by the brethren of the Council.    President Cannon further suggested that one of the  Apostles should visit the Southern States mission, the Northern  and eastern states Mission, and perhaps the same Apostle might  visit the European Mission. This would be in accordance with  the decision that the Apostles should be brought into closer  touch with the various missions.    Brother Henry Puzey formerly counselor to Bishop John  Sharp of the 20th Ward, well known and respected among the Saints^,^  was found dead this evening near the Guard House at Fort Doug-  las. He had baeen ^seized with^ paralysis, and fallen into a ditch in which  the water was not more than a foot deep. His head had come in  acontact with a rock inflicting a woulnd above one of his eyes.  He had been attacked before this, but had mearsureably recovered.  The old gentleman was regarded with deep affection by all classes  of the community. He was about 68 years of age, and leaves a wife, three Frank Henry Puzey William Charles Puzey sons and one daughter. 
 Salt Lake City, Apr. 16th, [18]83.    Brothers Young & Grant.    Dear Brethren:    I have  received several short letters from  you since you left Salt Lake City.  The first was dated Jan. 11th at Man-  nassa—you had set apart 5 mis-  sionaries. The second at Sunset  March 2nd—you had been to Moaencopy,  had visited the villages of the  Moquis; Br. Lot Smith wrote me  an account of your visit among  them, which I was very glad to  get. Your third and last letter was  written by Br. Grant March 5th, and  gave an account of the death of  Lot Smith's child.    I am interested in hearing   of your labors among the Lamanites  and Saints and to know how you  get along. We had a very inter-  esting conference. Saturday and Sun- 
 to do justice to my correspon-  dence but I will do the   best I can. I mention this  so you may not think that  I intentionally neglected to   answer your letters, for I  am deeply interested in your  letters and mission.    I received a letter a few  days since from Br. Mc  Donald and one from Jesse  N. Smith—both were inter-  esting.    I am pleased to hear  of the young men who are  willing to prepare themsel-  ves for a mission to the   Lamanites; for personally  I would much prefer to   go on a mission among  them than to the Gentiles.    As to news in Utah, I  think you get most of it  from the Deseret News. I attended  the funerals of Mary Van Cott  Young and Hellen Beatie. Br.  Jacob Gates has been down 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. Dec. 10th, 1889.    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    There is some business in Arizona that we would like you  to attend to while you are down there. Inclosed you will find correspondence from  Bp. Brinkerhoof, in which there are charges made against a son of Brother Lot Smith.  It will be well to have those charges carefully investigated and not be decided upon  mere rumor. Whatever is proper under the circumstances should be done by the  authorities there, under your counsel.    There may be other things there which may require your  attention. If so, we hope you will find it convenient to have them cleared up.    We have received a letter from Bp. McNeil, of Ramah—a let-  ter which you read. It contained a statement of the condition of their land and  the offer that had been made to them for its sale to them. We understand that you  wrote an answer, suggesting to them that they organize themselves into a company  and endeavor to buy the land on the terms that were offered, and to give the land  itself as security. This would be a very good plan, especially if they can get it  at a moderate interest. Something should be done to secure this land to the saints,  as Bp. McNeil represents it as a desirable place and one that others covet and would  doubtless gladly purchase; but if it passes out of the hands of the people it will  compel them to break up their homes and be a serious loss to them, which should be  avoided if it possibly can be. 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P. O. Box, B.    Salt Lake City, Utah. Oct. 24, 1893.    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    At a meeting with Elder A. F.  Macdonald on the 20th inst.—upon which occasion he submitted  to us a power of attorney given to him by the Messrs. Garcia  Brothers of the City of Mexico, conveying to him absolute author-  ity to dispose of certain of their lands immediately adjacent to  our settlements in Mexico—it was decided to refer this matter  to a committee consisting of yourself (as chairman). Elders Moses  Thatcher, George Teasdale, A. F. Macdonald and Henry Eyring,  with the request that you give Bro. Macdonald a hearing in re-  gard to this matter, and satisfy yourselves as to the advisabil-  ity of purchasing the lands for colonization purposes: and in  order that this may be done it will be necessary that the prop-  erty be inspected that its character and suitableness for col-  onization may be ascertained without question or doubt.    We may say that Bro. Macdonald reported to us that he ac-  cepted of this poerer of attorney on condition that we sanction  his doing so; and it is understood, in case it shall be deemed  advisable to enter into negotiations, that Bro. Macdonald will  hold himself ready and willing to administer the terms of the 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P. O. Box, B.    Salt Lake City, Utah. December 30th. 1892.    PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG,  Liverpool.    Dear Brother:    Your favor from Queenstown and those of 10th. and 13th. insts.  since you reached Liverpool have been duly received; we have also had the  gratification of a visit from Sister Lizzie and your daughter, who appeare  to be exceedingly happy in once more being at home with the Saints at head  quarters. We had great satisfaction in sending you a cablegram announc-  ing that all the indictments hanging over you in the third District Court  had been dismissed by Judge Zane, on motion of Preosecuting Attorney Varien  and we now take pleasure in informing you that we have decided on your re-  lease to return home in time to be present at the dedication of the Temple  in this city next April. We have not yet decided who shall be your suc-  cessor in the Presidency of the European Mission, but at present incline to  the idea of having some one of the Elders now laboring under your presi-  dency appointed to take temporary charge between the time you leave Liver-  pool and the arrival of your successor, who in all probability will start  from here immediately after the conclusion of the services incident to the  Annual Conference and the Temple dedication. We would like you to inform  us if there are any brethren whom you deem suitable to assume this tempor-  ary charge of the mission, and we will advise you of our action.    With constant prayers for your welfare, and for all Israel,    We remain, Your brethren,    W Woodruff    Geo. Q. Cannon    Jos. F. Smith 
 day the Big Tabernacle was crow-  ded and many were turned away  as they could not get seats. We  held about 4 meetings a day for  nearly a week; we had two hard  days work with Br. J. W. Y. who was  finally sustained at the conference.    We are going to fill up the Quorums  of the Seventies, and appoint a man  in the place of John Van Cott.    We set apart 107 missionaries after  conference who have gone to their fields  of labor—a great many to the South-  ern States. Br. Morgan, who has ar-  rived, spoke on Sunday and gave  an Excellent account of the work in  the south; there is a great change  in the public mind in our favor.    On Saturday I attended three  meetings including Mother Tenney's  funeral at G. Q. Cannons home, at  12 o'clock; she is his mother-in-law.    I have just received a letter from  Arza Hinkley of 25 pages giving   an account of the trial of Dan Jones  at Salt River.    The Presidency and Twelve are 
 to the gates of death but  when he got there he en-  tered a large room where  Joseph and Hyrum Smith  and the Apostles who have  died in this generation  were all gathered around  a large table in Council  and Joseph told him that  he desired to live and build   him a home in Provo, and  that he might go back  and build it he began to   recover from that hour very  slowly however, and he ex-  pects to get well. He is still  very feeble—not able to stand  on his feet. Br. Martin H.  Peck is not expected to live,  having a cancer in the   mouth. The Presidency  and Twelve are all well  as usual. F. D. Richards is  appointed assistant Historian  in laboring with me on   historical matters. Geo. Q. Can-  non started for New York 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS.    P.O. BOX B. Salt Lake City, U. T. Dec. 12th 1887.     Elder Brigham Young,  Snowflake, Apache Co.,  Arizona.    Dear Brother:    We are in receipt of two favors from  you, one under date of the 1st and the other the 4th inst.    We are very glad to learn that you were so   fortunate as to escape the snares of our enemies which  had been so well arranged for your capture. We sin-  cerely hope that you will be prudent in your movements  and keep out of the hands of your enemies.    We agree with you that Brother Martineaus  case, if investigated at all, should be investigated thor-  oughly, and in referring this business to you and the 
 2, B. Y.    power of attorney in accordance with our wishes, and the wishes  of those whom we may appoint to immediately supervise their dis-  position.    In our conversation upon this subject Bro. Macdonald sug-  gested that these lands would be very suitable as a place of set-  tlement of the Papago Indians who are now in Arizona, 1200 of  whom, he said, are members of the church. He will be able to  explain to the committee the situation of those Indians whom, be-  ing landless, it would be conferring a great benefit of them to   acquire title to land in Mexico, on the terms proposed by the  Garcia brothers.    We refer this whole business to your committee for in-  vestigation: and should you decide that the removal of the Papa-  go Indians is feasible, we should be pleased to have the committee  frame some plan of removal, and submit to us.    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith    P. S.    The other members of the committee have been informed of  this appointment.

Nov 14, 1887    Elder Brigham Young  Dear Brother:    I am in receipt of two letters  from you under date of the 9th and 11th inst.,    Your representation of the condition of  affairs of the Indians at Thistle Valley is rather  mournful. We regret that they should be in such  a condition, and such poor prospects for winter-  ing their stock. The case of Bishop John Spencer  as you describe it appeals strongly to our  sympathy, and we think he is deserving of  aid and should receive it. He is a man  that has made no complaints and has not   applied for any aid. We feel that something

 We trust that you will find it convenient while you are there to bestow some thought  and attention upon the indebtedness of Snowflake and Woodruff for the lands they  have purchased. You are familiar with all the details of this, and therefore we are  not under the necessity of mentioning them; but it is important that everything  that can be done should be done bny the people there tio meet future payments on the  lands. You have some knowledge of our condition as a Church in regard to funds.  We are under the necessity of borrowing to meet our current cash expenses, and or-  dinary prudence would suggest that no more load be laid upon us of this character  than is absolutely unavoidable.    With love, and praying the Lord to bless you and preserve   you in your journeying and labors,    We remain    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff    Geo. Q. Cannon    Jos. F. Smith 
 brethren with you it was hoped that you would be able to  do this in such a thorough and satisfactory manner  that the charges made against him would be cleared up,  so that there would be no doubt as to his innocence, or,  if wrong had been done, that he might be able to make  it right, to the satisfaction of all concerned. It is a very  serious position to be in, to be accused, as he has been,  of misusing funds dedicated to the Lord and paid in  by His people; and wrongdoing in that direction should  not be permitted to exist among us. If the accusations  be false, it is due to him, as well as to the people,  that they should be brought to light and disproved.    No doubt you get the papers and learn  all that is being done here in regard to the Riceiver-  ship. We have nothing much to complain of, aside  from the general enormity of the law itself and the   cunningly devised scheme of robbery which is embodied   in its provisions, excepting the seizure of our books by  the Receiver—books containing our current business, and  which the Government has no claim upon.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Jan. 15th, 1889.    Elder Brigham Young,    Bluff City, San Juan Co.    Dear Brother: We have received the enclosed letter and Notice from  Bp. James R. McNeil, of Ramah, N. M., which will explain themselves and the situa-  tion of the Saints at that place.    You are more or less acquainted with the affairs of the Saints at Ramah  and of their settlement and surroundings, and will be better enabled to take   cognizance of the situation than what we can do here.    On the receipt of this we desire you to put yourself in communication  with Bp. McNeil, and, at your earliest convenience, to make your arrangements  to meet with him and the Saints and take such steps for their welfare as the  Spirit of the Lord and your best judgment shall dictate in the premises.    We have written to Bp. McNeil, informing him that we have submitted this  matter into your hands, and he will no doubt be looking for something from you  as to what course to pursue.    Please give this your attention.    Praying the Lord to guide you and the Saints interested by the power and  influences of His good Spirit, and to give you success in this as in all your  labors,    I remain, Your Brother,    W Woodruff 
 must be done for him.    In relation to the subject of your letter  of the 11th, it will be better to make the  communication of which you speak to  our Delegate, Bro. John T. Caine. He can  act officially in the matter as the representative  of the people, and it will be more proper for  him to take whatever steps are needed in this  business than for Bro. John W. though John W.  may be able to render him aid. It will be  a very desirable object to have accomplished,  to get the liberty of moving around and  laboring upon these reservations, and would   help us fulfil that which we have before us.    We have had quite an exciting time here  of late over the Receivership. The ring were  very anxious to get Roseborough, Baskin or  Dickson, and Lane was considerably angered  because the other two Judges did not agree  with him. They sustained Marshal Dyer as

 Sept 17th [188]7    Brother Bushman.  St Joseph, Apache Co. Arizona    Dear Brother: I have made careful enquiry  concerning the settlement with Brother Lot Smith by the  committee. I have been informed that you are the  Chairman of the committee. It has been reported to   me that twice the settlement with Lot that the sub  committee are not satisfied and want to settle over  again. I do not know how this is, but I think one  settlement with him ought to be sufficient. I Fear  also that the committee require him to vent his brand  on his stock. This is very wrong inasmuch as he  has the body of the herd, while brothers who only have a  few head the brand could be vented on theirs. I have  also been informed that the committee would not let 
 Sept 17th [188]7    President David K. Udall  St John's, Apache Co. Arizona.    Dear Brother: I have made some enquiry  about the settlement with Lot Smith's by the committee.  I have been informed that Brother Bushman requires  him to vent the brand on his cattle; this is all wrong. No  man should vent the brand on his own cattle. His idea  has been carried to me that the Sub Committee want to  settle with him over again. My opinion is that one  settlement with a man, do able with, as he has been, ought  to be sufficient. I think Lot has been roughly handled.  If there has been any property made in that Institu-  tion, he has been the man most interested in making  it. I was there for two years with him, and he did  more work than any two men in the order. He cut the 
 regretted exceedingly that these were allowed to go into  his hands. Owing to the peculiar situation in  which we are placed, there was not that defense made,  and that firm though quiet resistance offered to the  seizure, that would have been had we been free or in  a position to have given counsel upon the subject. Our  attorneys assured us that they could not touch these  books, and we rested somewhat upon this assurance.  Of course, you have learned that the Temple Block,  the Tithing Offices, the Gardo House, the Historian  Office and the President's Office are all in our hands  at the present time. We pay $7500 a month for the   Gardo House, $100 a month for the Temple Block,  and $20000 a month for the Tithing Offices and premises  and the Historian Office. We have thought it better to  rent these various premises than to allow them to be rented  to others. We can take care of our property much better  than others can.    The "ring" have been very much disappointed

 Receiver and carried their point. He is moving   in the direction of taking possession of the  property, such as the Gardo House, Historians  Office, Tithing Office, and the temple. We  may probably rent the Tithing Office of him,  but the Temple block we shall do nothing about  except to defend our right to it as far as we  can. In considering this matter we thought it  better to rent the Tithing Office and buildings  because it will be inconvenient for us to  move elsewhere and erect such buildings as  we need, and it will also enable us to use  the personal property, such as delivery wagons,  teams &c.    The brethren are in the enjoyment of good  health. My own health is not preventing one  from attending to business, but I have been  suffering from a severe cold which has  been attended with a distressing cough,

 Aug. 30th 1889    Bishop H. B. Clawson,    Dear Brother:    Enclosed we forward you a draft for $800.00, being the  amount which is to be paid to Sam concerning which we had conversation with our  friend Maude when he was here. We trust you will receive it all right.    We hope you are having an enjoyable time at San Francis-  co. We all join in kind regards,    I remain,  Your Brother,    W Woodruff 
 have the brand that his stock are branded with.  He ought to have that, I think it is due him. He might  pay if the committee consider it necessary, but  he certainly ought to have it. I myself, do not think  that any man that went into that order and left it  took any less stock or property than what he put in,  and I think, generally, more. Whatever increase  of property there was in that order I am satisfied  that Lot Smith was the main instrument in  making it. I was with him two years and I am  satisfied he doid more work than any two men  in the order. He cut every acre of Wheat and  Lucerne. He was at the head of all the water ditches  and led in all the hard work. There has been a  good deal of prejudice against him for years past.  He went there by order of President Young and has  tried to carry out his counsel in all respects on that  work. I think that a man, that has gone through  what he has from this youth up for the Church and  Kingdom of God, ought not to be crushed injustly. 
 Hay, Wheat and Lucerne. He was at work on the water  ditches, and the raggedest man in Camp. I dont believe  there was a man went into the order but what took away  with him when he left, more than he took there. There has been  a great deal of prejudice against him from quarters where  it ought not to be expected. He has got his imperfections and  some of them strange ones; but he should not be persecuted.  He went to that country under the counsel of President Brigham   Young and he has done the best he could to carry out his  counsel. I think when the committee had once settled  with him they ought to let him alone and not continue  to annoy him, and the committee ought to let him have  the branding iron that his cattle are branded with.    I shall write to Brother Bushman upon this matter. I  would like you Brother Udall to do what you can to see  that the settlement with Lot is upon a fair basis. If he  has not been settled with in that manner the committee  should settle up with him. I want to know how he  stands. I wish you would write to me and let me know  how his affairs stand.

 August 16th, 1889.    Elder James G. Bleak,  St. George.    Dear Brother:    I received your letter of Aug. 7th, and in reply will say  that we have appropriated $500.00 for the assistance of your Stake Academy.    We have had a talk with Brother Thomas Judd about the  Factory. We have written a letter to the Board of Directors of the St. George Stake  Association, and I hope some arrangements may be made with Brother Judd, so that  he can put the Factory in working order, for the benefit of the people and of the  stockholders. We are also making some arrangements with Brother Thompson to build  a stone reservoir at his place and pipe from there to the Temple, instead of from  the Springs, which will do away with the engine and tank at the Temple. We realize  something has got to be done, as that tank is giving out, and we understand that   there is [T foot] fall from Thompson's to the Temple. I hope it may prove a success.    The devil and his workers are laboring hard for our  overthrow and destruction; but God still reigns. Our hope and trust are still in  Him. I hope Brother McAllister will get through his trouble all right.    Your Brother in the Gospel,    Wilford Woodruff 
 Sept 21st, [188]7.    Bishop James Mc Knight,  Minersville.    Dear Brother: Your letter of Sept 2nd concerning  your daughter who died some four years ago and left  three children, and asking what will be ^the^ best course for  you to pursue to carry out her requests, has been received   and considered.    You say that your daughter was married to a   young man named George Rollins, but she had separ-  ated from him over a year before she died on account of  his dissolute character and course of life &c That he was   baptized into the Church when about eight years old, and  that they were not sealed by the authority of the Priest-  hood and he has not shown any sign of reformation   since her death; and at her request and since her death 
 If the committee have settled with him, they  ought to let it rest. If they have not settled with   him they ought to do so upon just principles.  I realize he has imperfections, and some he  ought to get rid of, as well as the rest of us. I wish  you would write to me and tell me if the   committee have settled with him. If not, what  is yet to be done?    My health is good, all is peace and  quietude with us as far as the times will  admit.    I remain    Your Brother in the Gospel  Wilford Woodruff

 Feb. 26th 1889.    Hon. James O. Broadhead,   St. Louis.    My dear friend: I feel it my duty, as also a pleasure, to communicate   a few lines to you.    My short acquaintance with you has been of the most pleasing and satis-  factory nature. Whatever the final result of our affairs may be in the courts,  I feel to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in that you came into our employ  and were associated with us in our important suit with this great government.   I have looked forward with much interest for a copy of your argument before  the U. S. Supreme Court and did not receieve one until last evening. Being somewhat  weary with business, I retired to rest, leaving the argument to be read in the  morning; but I could not sleep, and at midnight I arose, lit my lamp, sat at  the table, and read your argument through. I became convinced, for the first time,  that the U. S. Supreme Court could not consistently confiscate our property, real  or personal, for I cannot see any ground whatever left for the court to work  upon to sustain them in such an action, notwithstanding the great amount of 
 October 3 [188]7    President J. D. T. McAllister.  St George.  Dear Brother:    Your very interesting and   newsy letter of Sept 30th giving details on  Temple matters and things in general, has  been received and perused with much pleasure.  I have been sick for a week but am now  at the table again at my work. There is a  good deal of sickness in this city and in this  northern country. Fevers are very prevalent   and several deaths. Elder L John Nuttall  has also been unwell for a few days past  and although at the office to-day he is not  feeling as well as I wish he was. 
 March 18th, 1889.    Katie Paxman,    Nephi, Juab Co.    Dear Sister—Your favor of the 13th inst was duly received. The quiet  and comforts of home and the society of kindred and friends must be a most   welcome change to you from the experiences of three and a half years' sojourn  among strangers in foreign lands, under, no doubt, constantly trying and laborious,  and sometimes distressing, circumstances, although, perhaps, your foreign mission  has not been wholly devoid of profit or pleasure. I congratulate you on your  safe return and on heaven's gift to you of a son in the New and Everlasting  Covenant.    My time being very much occupied, it is difficult for me to say, just   now, when I shall pay a visit to Nephi.    With kind regards to yourself and parents, and wishing a kindly remem-  brance to brother Paxman when you write to him,    I remain your Brother in the Gospel,    W Woodruff 
 she has been sealed to Elder John D. T. Mcallister and you  now wish to know as to whom her children shall be  sealed.    Were the father of these children in full  faith and fellowship in the Church and worthy of  the custody of the children, I would suggest that  they remain as they are, until they are of an age  that they can choose for themselves as to which  parent they would be sealed. But as his course  is such, as you state, it will be proper for the  children to be sealed to Prest Mcallister and their  mother, which can be attended to when yourself  and the children are all at St George.    With kind regards,  Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff 
 Sept. 17th [188]7    Prest. L. W. Shurtliff    Dear Brother:    There is a subject  that I wish to speak to you about. In Salt Lake City  there is but one "Mormon" hotel and that is the Valley  House, kept by Bro. Hall, who is a good Latter-day Saint.  All the other hotels are kept by our enemies and of the  "Loyal League" and they combine against the Valley  House; call it "damned Mormon hotel," still many of  our brethren come to Salt Lake and go to the Contin-  ental and other hotels and feed our enemies, who fight   against us. Now, Bro. Shurtliff, I wish you would  use your influence as far as you can with those of  your Stake who come to the city and put up at 
 May 29th [188]9    Legrand Young, Esqr.    Dear Brother:    After I left you I found Bros. F. S. Richards   and Geo. Q. Cannon at the office speaking upon that sueing  question. They represent that I told you to go ahead and sue  Bro Armstrong. Now I do not know as you understood  me. My view was that Bro. Armstrong would not compromise  and if any body had to be sued that Bro Armstrong should be the  first: But the brethren say that Armstrong has not refused  to compromise.    Now Brother Young, I still think that compromise  should be tried before the law. The brethren say that there  are men in Farmer's Ward who are opposed to those in the  Canyon and say they are not entitled to a drop of water, and 
 prejudice which has been heaped up against us, an unpopular people, in order to  have the decision of the Supreme Court of this Territory in confiscating our  property, both real and personal, confirmed by the U. S. Supreme Court.    I never read a more forcible and unanswerable argument in my life upon  any subject. It certainly will require something more than sophistry of un-  principled men to override what iron bulwark of constitutional and fundamental  law which you have placed before them. I cannot now believe that the Supreme  Court of the United States, the highest tribunal of the nation, after thoroughly   considering your argument, will attempt to escheat and confiscate the real and  personal property of the Latter-day Saints. If they do, I tremble for my country.    My dear friend, I, in connection with my people, will feel under everlast-  ing obligations to you for the great labor you have bestowed and the interest  you have taken in our welfare. It matters not what the decision of the Supreme  Court may be upon this question, it will not lessen the obligations that we  are under to you. I feel that the Lord has inspired you in this work.    I have a birthday party at my home, with a few friends, on Friday night,  March 1st, the anniversary of my eighty-second birthday. It would have been  exceedingly gratifying to me if you could have made one of the party.    My dear friend, I do not know that we shall ever meet again in the flesh;  but as I am a great believer in meeting friends in the next world, I hope and 
 Nov. 18, 1890.  Noah H. Osborne,    My Dear Friend:    I have just received your very interesting letter  of Nov. 13th; and I was much interested in the account you gave of our relation-  ship. I was also much interested in the letter of your friend, Israel Coe. I  was astonished at his writing, a man of his great age. In answering your ques-  tions concerning Sidney Rigdon I will say, he was cut off from the church, and  was not a member of the church when he died; he did not deny the faith but took  the ground that he had the right to lead the church, and refused to acknowledge  the Twelve Apostles and the constituted authorities of the church after the   death of Joseph and therefore he was cut off the church. Now concerning your  question about the abolition of polygamy, I will send you a copy of my manifesto  which will explain all that I said upon the subject. Concerning what you say  about "Leaves from my Journal" I will say, I wrote that little work for the ben-  efit of our Sabbath School children, giving them a little history of my experi-  ence during my travels, and I stated nothing in it but what was true. We have   in Salt Lake City a grandsonof Grandfather Lot Thompson, he is here writing up  the city; he is the son of Cyrus Thompson. He and his wife attended with my  family my last birth-day party, the first day of last March.    I am certainly pleased to hear from you, not only as a relative  but from a man of great age, and one who has faith in God, and in His Son  Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world: also in the Gospel which He preached,  as the plan of salvation for a fallen world. I remain    Your affectionate kinsman and friend,  Wilford Woodruff    P. S.  I herewith return Israel Coe's letter thinking you may desire to pre-  serve it.    W. W. 
 Our conference is drawing near and we  are extremely busy attending to the regular  daily duties, and holding meetings.    I wish you would ^see^ after the Tank, Bro.  Thompson reports that it is caving in. this   should be attended to in some shape. I would  like you to  inform me about it.    Notwithstanding the vigilance of our  enemies we are most signally preserved,  and we feel to thank the Lord for His many  Kindnesses to us.    Ever praying for the welfare of Zion  and all her interests and with kindest  regards to you, Brothers D. H. KanCannon, Bleak  and the brethren & sisters, and asking God  to preserve You from the hands of the  wicked and ungodly.    I remain  your Brother  W. W.

I  prize them very highly. The first thought that struck me on looking upon the   beautiful pleasing countenance was, that the face bespoke the goodness, honesty  and benevolence of the soul of the man. We cannot forget the part you have  taken in the history of the Latter-day Saints in the days of their deep afflic-  tion in Nauvoo.    Yours sincerely,    Wilford Woodruff 
 hotels, that they would patronize the Valley House. Bro.  Hall sets as good a table and has as good beds as any  hotel in the city. I do not ask this alone because I  am the owner of the Valley House, but out of principle.  I think it is our duty to do what we can to sustain  ourselves in these matters. I wish you would use your  influence in this direction and it will help Bro. Hall in   the warfare that is against him.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  Wilford Woodruff
