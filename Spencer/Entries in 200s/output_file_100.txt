He remarked  "some say the kingdom of God was not set  up on earth untill the day of pentecost and that  John did not preach the baptism of repen tance for the remission of sins. But I say in  the name of the Lord that the kingdom  of God was set upon earth from the days  of Adam to the present time whenever  there has been a righteous man on earth unto  whom God revealed his word and gave power  and authority to administer in his name:  And whare theire is a Priest of God, A minister  who has power and Authority from God to  administer in the ordinances of the Gospel  and officiate in the Priesthood of God, theire  is the kingdom of God and in consequence  of rejecting the gospel of Jesus Christ and the  Prophets whom God hath sent, the judgm- ents of God hath rested upon people, cities and nations in various ages of the world, which  was the case with the cities of Sodom and gomo- roah who were destroyed for rejecting the  Prophets. Now I will give my testimony I care not for man I speak boldly and faith- fully and with authority. How is it with the  kingdom of God, whare did the kingdom  of God begin, whare their is no kingdom  of God their is no salvation. What consti- tutes the kingdom of God    ENDENTRY  Whare there is a prophet, a priest, or a righ- teous man unto whom God gives his oracles  there is the kingdom of God, and whare the oracles of God are not there the kingdom  of God is not. In these remarks I have  no allusion to the kingdoms of the earth, we  will keep the Laws of the Land, we do not  speak against them, we never have, and we  can hardly make mention of the State  of Missouri of our persecutions there andc  but what the cry goes forth that we are  guilty of larceny, Burglary, arson treason and murder andc andc which is fals, we speak of  the kingdom of God on the earth not the  kingdoms of mem. The plea of many in  this day is that we have no right to receive  revelations. But if we do not get revelations  we do not have the oracles of God and if they  have not the oracles of God they are not the people of God. But say you what will  become of the world or the various professors  of religion who do not believe in revelation and the oracles of God as continued to his  Church in all ages of the world when he  has a people on earth. I Tell you in the  name of Jesus Christ they will be damned  and when you get into the eternal  world you will find it to be so they cannot  escape the damnation of hell   As touching the gospel and baptism that John preached I would say that John came preach- ing the gospel for the remission of sins he  had his authority from God and the oricles  of God were with him and the kingdom of God   ENDENTRY for a season seemed to rest be with John alone. The Lord promised Zecheriah that he  should have a son, which was a desendant  of Aaron and the Lord promised that the  priesthood should continue with Aaron and his  seed throughout their generations. Let No man take this honour upon himself  except he be called of God as was Aaron, and Aaron received his Call by Revelation. An  angel of God Also appeared unto Zecheriah  while in the Temple and said that he should have a  son whose name should be John and he should  be filled with the Holy Ghost. Zechariah was  a priest of God and officiating in the Temple and John was a priest after his father and held the keys of the aronic priesthood and was called of God  to preache the Gospel and the kingdom of God and the Jews as a nation having departed  from the Law of God and the gospel the Lord  prepared the way for transfering it to the gentiles But says one the kingdom of God could  not be set up in the days of John for John  said the Kingdom was at hand. But I would  ask if it could be any nearer to them than  to be in the hands of John, the people need  not wait for the days of Pentecost to find  the kingdom of God for John had it with  him, and he came forth from the wilderness  crying out repent ye for the kingdom of  heaven is at hand as much as to kaul out  here I have got the kingdom of God and I am  coming after you. Ive got the kingdom  of God and you can get it and I am coming  after you and if you dont receive it you  will be damned and the scriptures represant    ENDENTRY that all Jerrusalem went out unto Johns Baptism Here was a legal administrator, and those that were  baptized were subjects for a king and also the laws  and oracles of God were there therefore the king- dom of God was there, for no man could have  better authority to Administer than John and our Savior submitted to that authority himself  by being baptized By John therefore the  kingdom of God was set up upon the earth  even in the days of John their is a difference  between the kingdom of God and the fruits and blessings that flow from that kingdom  becaus their was more miracles, gifts, gracsvisions  healings, tongues andc in the days of Jesus Christ  and the Apostles and on the day of pentecost than  under Johns Administration, it does not  prove by any means that John had not the  kingdom of God; any more than it would  that a woman had not a milk pan because she  had not a pan of milk, for while the pan might  be compared to the kingdom the milk might  be compared to the blessings of the kingdom John was a priest after the order of Aaron and had the keys of that priesthood and came forth  preaching repentance and baptism for the remis- sion of sins but at the same time crys out  there cometh one after me more mighter than  I the latches of whose shoes I am not worthy  to unlose, and Christ came according to the words of  John, and he was greater than John because he  held the keys of Melchisedic Priesthood and the kingdom of God and had before revealed the  priesthood to Moses, yet Christ was baptised  by John to fulfill all righteousness and Jesus  in his teaching says upon this rock I will  build my Church and the gates of hell shall not   ENDENTRY prevail against it. what rock, Revelation Again he says except ye are born of the water  and the spirit ye cannot inter into the kingdom  of God, and though the heavens and earth  should pass away my words shall not pass away If a man is born of the water and the spirit he can get into the kingdom of God it is evident the kingdom of God was on  the earth and John prepared subjects for  kingdom by preaching the gospel to them  and baptising them and he prepared the way d before the Savior or came as a fore runner  and prepared subject for the preaching of  Christ, and and Christ preached through  Jerrusalem on the same ground whare  John had preached and when the Apostles were  raised up they worked in Jerrusalem and Jesus commanded them to tarry there  untill they were endowed with power from  on high had they not work to do in Jer rusalem, they did work, and prepared a  people for the pentecost. The kingdom of  God was with them before the day of pen- tecost as well as afterwords and it was also  with John and he preached the same gospel  and baptism that Jesus and the Apostles preached  after him. The endowment was to  prepare the desiples for their mission in to  the world.

House here named should  have been translated Kingdom and any  person who is exhalted to the highest mansion  has to abide a celestial law and the whole law  to. But their has been a great difficulty  in getting anything into the heads of this  generation it has been like splitting hemlock  knots with a corn doger for a wedge and a  pumpkin for a beetle; even the saints are  slow to understand I have tried for a number  of years to get the minds of the saints prepared  to recieve the things of God, but we freequently  see some of them after suffering all they have  for the work of God will fly to peaces like glass  as soon as any thing comes that is contrary to  their traditions, they cannot stand the  fire all at all.

Smith came into the room and said he had a dream  and related it to us which was as follows.   FIGURE I was standing on a peninsula in the midst  of a vast body of water whare their appears  to be a large harbor or a peer built out for boats  to come into. I was surrounded by my friends and while looking at this harbor I saw a Steem  boat approaching the harbour, their was bridges  on the peer for persons to cross and there  came up a wind and drove the steem boat  under one of the bridges and upset it. I run  up to the boat expecting the persons would all  drowne and wishing to do sumthing to assist  them. I put my hand against the side of the  boat and with one surge I shoved it under the bridge  and righted it up and then told them to take care of  themselves. But it was not long before I saw  them starting out into the channel or main body  of the water again. The storms were raging and  the waters rough. I said to my friends that if  they did not understand the signs of the times  and the spirit of Prophecy they would be   ENDENTRY apted to be lost. It was but a few moments after when we saw the waves break over the boat and she soon founderd and went down with all on board and perished the storm and waters were still vary rough, yet I told my friends around me that I believed I could stem those waves and storm and swim in the waters better than the steem boat did and at any rate I was determined to try it but my friends laughed at me and told me I could not stand the storm at all but should be drouned, the waters looked clear and beautif ul though exeeding rough, and I said I believed I could swim and I would try it anyhow they said I would drown. I said I would have a frolic in the water first if I did, and I dove off in to the raging waves. I had swum but a short distance when a towering wave overwhelmed me for a time but I soon found myself on the top of it and soon I met the second wave in the same way and for awhile I struggled hard to live in the midst of the storm and waves but I soon found I gained upon evry wave and stemmed the torrent better and better and I soon had power to swim with my head out of water so the waves did not break over me at all, and I found I had swam a great distance and in looking about me I saw Br Samuel by my side. I asked him how he liked it he said first rate and I thought so to. I was soon enabled to swim with my head and sholdiers out of water and I could swim as fast as any steem boat, and in a little time it becaim calm and I could rush through the water and ownly go in to my loins and soon I ownly went in to my knees and finally   ENDENTRY could tread on the top of the water and went almost with the speed of an arrow and I said to Samuel see how swift I can go and i thought it was great sport and pleasure to travel with such speed and I awoke.    what the interpetation of the foregoing dream was the spirit of God or time must determin   ENDENTRY In the evening of this day FIGURE the quorum met at Wm W Clayton and Joseph Young met with them but I was not present.

But I met with a congregation of the citizens in the room over Joseph store for the purpose of hearing the views of General Joseph Smith given concerning the affairs of government his views were written and were re^a^d by Wm. W Phelps and were in the highest degree interesting. Gen Smith gave his reasons for permitting his name to go forth as a candidate for the Presidency of The United States, which were as follows I would not have suffered my name to have been used by my friends on any wise as president of the united States or candidate for that office If I and my friends could have had the privilege of enjoying our religious and civel rights as American Citizen even those rights which the Constitution guarantee unto all her citizens alike but this we as a people have been denied from the beginning. Persecution has rolled upon our heads from time to time from portions of the United States like peels of thunder because of our religion and no portion of the government as yet has steped forward for our relief and under view of these things I feel it to be my right and privilege to obtain what influence and power I can lawfully in the United States for the protection of injured innocence and If I loose my life in a good cause I am willing to be sacrificed on the alter of virtue rightousness and truth in maintaining the laws and constitution   ENDENTRY of the United States if need be for the general  good of mankind. Many other interesting  remarks were made. He was followed by Elders  Taylor, and a vote was taken whether  the views of Gen Smith would be maintained by  the assembly or not. the vote was universal in  the affirmative.

I will proclaim in publick and in private  that the sisters bought the glass and nails by penny  subscription. Chuse ye this day wholm ye will  serve. We shall call upon this vast multitude  for a donation to buy powder and fuse rope. We  want the brethren to do as much as the sisters.  We do not intend to finish the Nauvoo House  this season but to finish the Temple this summer  or the walls of it and get the roof on by December  and do of the inside next winter and about a year  from this spring we will dedicate it we can  do any thing we undertake we have power and we  can do great things. In 5 years to come the work  will progress more than it has for 10 years past  Isaiah said we should perform a marvelous work  and a wonder. I dont wonder he said so if he  saw this vast multitude and I think this people is  abundantly able to build this temple and much depends  upon it our endowments and sealing powers and many  blessings depend upon it. The Prophet arived and  took the stand and arose in the midst of the  said (Orson Pratt come and take your post) and further  remarked I do not know whether the object  of the meeting has been told or not I apologize for not  comeing sooner. I have had so much on my mind  since I saw you that I hardly know whare to  begin or to say but one of the grand objects that  I had in view in calling this meeting was in making  a few remarks relative to the laws and ordinances  and building the temple, the reason I want to  speak of the laws is the officers have difficulty  in administering the laws. We are republican and  wish to have the people rule but rule in righteousness   ENDENTRY So none would complain with what God himself  would do, the laws are enacted by petition and  they can all be repealed if they wish it but the  people ought not to complain of the officers but  to complain of the law makers. I am instructed  by the city council to tell this people that if you do  not like any law we have passed we will repeal it  for we are your servants. Any that complain of  our rights and charters it is because they are  wicked the devil is in them. the reason I called  it up is we have a simple gang of fellows who  does not know whare their elbows or head is if  you preach virtue to them they will oppose that if  you preach Methodist God to them they will oppose  that or any thing els and if their is any case tried  they want it appealed to Carthage. Mr Boswicks case  had to go to Carthage our Lawyers will send any  thing to Carthage. I want to know if the citizens  will sustain me when my hands are raised to heaven  for the people. I will areign the person before the  people that act against the interest of the city and  I will have the voice of the people which is republican  and as likely to be the voice of God. And as long as long as long as I have a tongue to speak I will expose  the iniquity of the Lawyiers and wicked men  I fear not their boiling over nor their boiling over nor the boiling over of Hell their thunders and forked  lightning. I despise the man that will betray you with  a kiss. Here is Hiram Kimball has set at naught the ordinances of the city. By saying that He owns  the wharf and steem boats need not pay them.  wharefore this body is the highest court what appeal  to Carthage I would not appeal there if i died a  thousand deaths. Kimball nor Morrison does not  own the wharfage Water Street runs along the   ENDENTRY beach. and belongs to the city and not individuals I will reprove the lawyers and docters any how Jesus did and evry prophet has and if I am a prophet I shall do it, at any rate I shall do it for i profess to be a prophet. The laws and constitution of the United States has ended up the right to corperate cities to regulate all wharfage of shiping and steem boats andc all laws of taxation is subject to the city and not individuals. And I want from this time forth evry fool to stay at home and let the steem boats and captain alone and let the peace officers alone. How can we keep off mobs and keeping innocent blood from being shed, by striking a blow at evry thing that rises up in disorder and I will war an eternal war with those that oppose me while I am labouring in behalf of the city. A man has been writing to the New York Tribune. I will not mention his name. He says that much has been appropriated for the building the Temple that has been spent for other purposes. But I pledge myself that any man that has paid any old shoes, harnesses, horses, or any thing els if he will come I will show him on book that evry farthing has gone on book and been appropriated for the building of the Temple if not so I will pledge my head for a foot ball that this is true their are men in our midst who are trying to build up themse lves at our expense and others in our midst that are watching for iniquity and will make a man an offender for a word. But I will rest myself and give way for others. President Hyram Smith arose and made some singular remarks quite romantic compared the lawyiers to polewags and wiglers and toads. He said they would dry up next fall these characters he thought was made in gigard making time when it was cheaper then in soul making time   ENDENTRY A Brother of Dr Foster threatend the mayor and the mayor fined him $10. President Joseph Smiths views of the goverment was then read, which was recieved with universal applause Gen Smith is now nominated by the saints as a candidate for President of the U.S.A. next election.

A. Smith who bore testimony  of the work of God I spent the night at Br  James McDaniel's.  Pittsburgh resembles the  English cities in consequence of their burning so  much stone cole which covers the cities with  smoke soot and blackness.

We met in the evening at Br  B Young  first addressed the meeting FIGURE The following  are some of the principles taught the Elders  By Elders Young. He says relative to government  that a man should in the first place presidie  over himself, his passions, his person, bring himself  into subjection to the Law of God, then Preside   ENDENTRY over his children and his wife in wrighteousnes then he will be capable of Presiding over a  branch of the Church but many Elders are  contending about presiding over Churches when  they are not capable of presiding over themselve or the least child I have they have.  Again the first Principle of our cause and work is to  understand that their is a prophet in the Church  and that he is at the head of the Church on Earth. who  called Joseph Smith to be a prophet? Did the people  or God. God and not the people called him, had the  people gatherd together and appointed one of their  number to be a Prophet he would have been  accountable to the people but inasmuch as he  was called of God and not the people he is accountable  to God and the Angel that committed the Gospel  to him and not to any man on earth. The Twelve  are accountable to the Prophet and his council  and not to the Church for the course they persue  and we have learned to go and do as the Prophet  tells us to do    ENDENTRY July 30, 1843 ~ Sunday   30th Sunday six of the quorum of the Twelve  met at Temperance Hall in Pittsburgh  with the Saints. Elder G. A. Smith opened the  meeting by prayer Elder W. Woodruff  addressed the people bore testimony of the work  and spoke the things that were given by the  Spirit of God, among other things said that  the Church of God was organized with  Prophets and Apostles, but what is the use of  Prophets and Apostles if their is not to be revelations  given and work for the apostles to do they certainly  are not needed, if the work of Prophets and Apostles are not to be received, but the vary Idie  of those offices exhisteding is a proof of Revelation and gifts andc   ENDENTRY I was followed by Elder G A Smith who also  bore testimony of the work of God and among other  things said that whenever FIGURE God sent a witness  or messenger to deliver a message to the inhabitants  of the earth he does not require that messenger  to prove the truth of his assertion but deliver his  message as God has commanded him   In the after part of the day, Elder J. E. Page  addressed the meeting and bore testimony of the  work and was followed by Elder O. Pratt who  reasoned soundly upon the prophesyes   In the evening at early candle light the meeting  was addressed by Elder H. C. Kimball who gave  some of his experiance and bore testimony to the  work of the Lord much to our edifycation He was followed by Elder B Young who  also bore testimony to the work of the Lord  and among the many remarks he made he  argued in the following manner. Why do the people  oppose the gifts and graces. If a man can get faith  by the power of God and the gift of the Holy Gost so as to  lay hands upon his wife and children or friends  when they lie sick and languishing nigh unto death  and command the fever, or disease, or the power  of the destroyer, or even death itself to depart to  cease its work, to be still and the person is relieved  I ask what harm is their in all this, or if a man  by faith and humility before God can get the  testimony of Jesus Christ and prophecy of things to  come or speak in tongues or cast out devils, I  ask what harm in all this, does it do any harm  No it does not. I know the New Testament  is true for I have proved it according to the  pattern given by believing in Christ obeying   ENDENTRY the gospel and knowing the signs do follow,  then I ask does these things harm any one, No  they do not. In speaking of the kingdom of  God, he said the kingdom must be together  the people must be together and gatherd into  one place. For how would the king of france  or England look undertaking to reign over a  kingdom when the people were scatterd all  over the world except in france or England  they could not reign over a people unless a people  were with those kings to reign over, so with the  saints they must be gatherd together and this work has  already commenced, and who is the Author of this  work and gathering, Josephs Smith the Prophet of  God as an instrument in the hands of God is the  Author of it, he is the greatest man on earth No other man of this age has power to  assemble such a great people from all the Nations  of the earth with all their varied dispositions  as assimulate them and cement them together  so that they will be subject to rule and order this the Prophet is doing and what makes a  great king President or man is to have a  great People to rule over.   We had an  interesting time through the day. After meetig  closed I went home with Elder Charles Beck  and spent the night    ENDENTRY July 31, 1843 ~ Monday   31st Our Quorum assembled together and walked  over Pittsburgh.

Mr Litz preached from  Jer 24 ch concerning the good and bad figs. is in speaking  of the covenant made to Abraham in giving him the  land of Canaan, he said it was not to seeds but seed  which was Christ, so the land belong to Jesus Christ  and not the Jews but Jesus Christ had rented it to the  Jews at 6 per cent or for evry 10th and the ownly  terms on which it was given to the Jews, and that  they were robing God all the while, will a man  rob God andc and the Land was taken away from  the Jews and who shall have the land not  the Jews the natural seed. But those that are  Baptised into Jesus Christ and his spiritual children, the kingdom was to be taken from the Jews and  given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits there  of which will take place when Christ come  with his Church and body and will then take  Jerrusalem. -Why did he not say that it has already  been given to the gentiles and they have also fallen away-   ENDENTRY The Jews as a nation will not go to the land  of Jerrusalem and when Jesus Christ comes the  Jews will No more be his people. I will admit  that the Jews will go with the other Nations  against Jerrusalem to battle against the Lord  and his Saints and fight against Jerrusalem and  the Lord shall go forth and fight against the  Nations and the Jews among the rest and that the  Jews will fight agains Jerrusalem if the Jews  ever go to Jerrusalem they will not go as Jews  but all Christians as Christ body andc andc   The above was the arguments presented by  the milerite to do away with the literal fulfill- ment of the Bible concerning the return of  the Jews and the rebuilding of Jerrusalem.  But most of his arguments were fals and  groundless   In the afternoon we met with the Saints  In the Canaanite Church in Julia Ann St about 300 Saints were present, meeting  was opened by Elder B. Young  addressed the congregation to considerable  length and laid a good foundation among other  things said, that a man or woman may ask  of God and get a witness and testimony from God  concerning any work or messenger that is sent  unto them. But if a person asks for a thing that  does not concern him, such as governing the  Church what shall the prophet or the Twelve  do andc he will not get an answer if he does it  will not be from God.    He also remarked in  conversation or inquired who had the Melchezedek  priesthood that if any in the Church had it he did not  know it For any person to have the fulness of that    ENDENTRY priesthood must be a king and a Priest a  person may have a portion of that Priesthood the  same as Governors or Judges of England have  power from the King to transact business but  yet he is not the king of England.

A great white  throne appeared, the Saints and cities were cought up  to God, the Heavens and earth passed away and the Lord  made a new heavens and new earth the Saints cities and  new Jerrusalem andc came down from God out of  heaven and rested upon the new earth and the last enemy  destroyed was death then Jesus Christ deliverd it up  to his father as pure andc   ENDENTRY the nation will now be deprived of the benefit of that  wisdom and intelligence which the Prophet seer and  revelator would have brought to light that would have been used for the benefit of the nations,  But now their die is cast and doom is sealed, and  their judgment will come in an hour they are not  aware of. It was so with the Jews, they said if  we let Jesus alone he will come and take away  our state and Nation so they crusifyed his  shed his blood and said let it be upon us and our  Children. And the judgments came upon them their city was laid in the dust, and the inhabitants fell by the sword and famine and the remnant was  scattered throughout the gentile world, while if  they had recieved Jesus Christ he would oft  had gatherd together the people and saved the city.  When the nations of the earth send their messeng ers or ministers to any people and they are not recieved but  ^wel^ intreatly and killed treated lightly and killed will not  that nation take vengance on their enemies is God then of less consequence than man, when he sends  his Prophets, messengers and servants to the world with  a message and the people cast them out stone shoot  and kill them, will not God take vengance on that nation yea he ever did and ever will, and this nation will not escape. John said in pouring out the plagues upon the earth 16 ch 3 v. that he poured out his vial upon  the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and  evry living soul died in the sea, and the third angel  poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountain of  waters and they became blood. And the Angel said  the Lord was righteous in so doing for they have shed  the blood of Saints and Prophets and thou hast given them  blood to drink for they are worthy 6 v. Some yay it  was in the days of Jesus Christ, But it was not in the  days of Jesus Christ for John lived after and saw  things in the last days. It seems that the waters  was turned to blood because they had shed the   ENDENTRY Blood of Prophets and Saints. Their was to be  two Prophets in Jerrusalem slain, for they tormented  them. Prophets are always a torment to the People for they tell them the truth, reprove their transgressions speak of the Judgments that are to come, when those  prophets were to be slain the people all would rejoice  and send Presents to one another because the prophets who  had tormented them were slain, but in three days  they stood upon their feet and the Joy of their enemies  was of short duration. It is so now their is a secret  Joy in the hearts of the Priest and many people  that the Prophet and Patriarch is murdered and  some manifest their joy openly. It is always a  dark time Just before day, it is a dark time now but it will soon be light. When Christ was crucifyed  it was a dark time they were ready to go to their farm  fishing and merchandize and Peter sent to inquire if  he was the one or if we should look for another, the  answer was go and tell them what you see and  hear, feel my body I have arisen and Joy immediatly  arose in their bosom. As soon as the Jews found he  had arisin they bribed the guard to say that while they  were asleep his deciples stole him away, which saying  is believed among the Jews untill the present day and they are taken in their own snare for it has been  that vary key that has chained them untill the present  time, and so it is with this nation they have sealed their  damnation by shedding the blood of the vary man that  holds the keys of this last dispensation and consequently  their destiny. A word about Br Joseph being killed some have thought he could not be killed, but the Lord  never said so neither did Joseph say so. So did  Peter say to Jesus when he told him that he would be slain  or offered, far be it from thee this shall not come upon  thee Jesus said get thee behind me Satan thou savoreth not  the things that be of God but of men.   ENDENTRY In the first instance The Prophet crossed the river  to Iowa and while there he inquired of the Lord what he   should do and the Lord told him to return and give  himself up he appeared to be aware that he would be slain. The covenants convey this ^same^ idea ^concerning Joseph^ see Page 159 4 par Behold I grant unto you eternal life if you should be slain Page 126, 1 and 2 Par. It is supposed by some that the Govornor  had a hand in this affair, at first they were not ready to  recieve him for the plan was not finished how to dispose  of him. The Govornor had taken away all of the state  arms, and was in Nauvoo requesting them to give up  their private arms at the same time that they were murder- ing our brethren at Carthage Jeal. as soon as the word came  the govornor fled, the women and children removed so as to come stir up the world to come and destroy the place but this failed. In consequence of the death  of the prophets the Editors seem to get the spirit of prophecy and say the work is done and will stop, and die. But as I  am in the midst of the Prophetic Editors like Saul I  ketch some of the spirit of Prophecy and so I will prophesy  that instead of the work diying it will be like the mustard  stock that was ripe that a man undertook to throw out  of his garding and scattered seed all over it and next  year it was nothing but mustard. It will be so by  shedding the blood of the prophets it will make 10 Saints  whare their is one now. Some said that he would  be President, but is now dead, now what will he do the Revelator says He that overcometh will I give  Power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a  rod of Iron. I dont know but he may hold the keys  of the Plagues that are to be poured out in the last  days upon this and other nations. Angels appeared  anciently to John, who were his fellow servants the prophets Joseph may appear in this day to his brethren This gospel of the kingdom must be preached in all the world  for a testimony then shall the end come though they should   ENDENTRY be persecuted if they endured to the end they should be saved. This generation speak much about the clouds  and weather they disern the face of the sky but why  can they not disern the signs of the times. The fig trees  are leaving and all things indicate the second advent of Christ.    Elder B Young arose and said he felt disposed to add his testimony, be of good cheer, the testiment is not  in force while the Testator liveth when he died it was  in force so it is with Joseph, on the day of Pentecost  their was but 120 of the Saints, but at that time  their were added 3000 souls. when God sends a  man to do a work all the devils in hell cannot kill him  untill he gets through his work. So with Joseph He  prepared all things gave the keys to men on the earth and said I may be soon taken from you.    I recieved an extra Nauvoo Neighbor during the evening  which gave an account of the death of ^the^ Prophet and Patriarch  at the close of the meeting I went home and spent the night with a brother    ENDENTRY July 19, 1844 ~ Friday   19th FIGURE I borrowed $10 dollars of Br Boston  and gave my note for it and $5 dollars of Brother Wingate  and gave my note for that.
