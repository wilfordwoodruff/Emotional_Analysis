In regard to my health I will saythat my lungs keep in splendid conditionbut my general health is not the best andmy constitution seems to be considerabelyweakened there is not that life and vigorabout me there used to be in fact thelife a missionary has to lead in someof these districts will test any ones strengthbut London will probabely be better—notthe atmosphere but the living.

But as I have gone thislong I will stick it out another year.The conferences here are so poor thatthey cannot pay expenses rents etc let alone 
 have melted away before you, and how unanimously at last has come the victory after somany years of injustice and oppression, I have been forced to feel that the spirit of ahigher power than that of man has been controlling in the movements and destiny of yourpeople and in the final judgment toward them of the whole American people. All of us aswe grow older learn to value more and more highly the gifts that come to us through dis-cipline, and it is a strange part of human life that nearly everything that is dearestto us, most to be treasured, and most preservative of our liberty, comes to us dearlybought by suffering, sacrifice, and often longtime oppression. Nearly everything dearto human life has been gained along these high lines, where human endurance has beentested, where character and patience have been put to bitter test, and where all that is good and noble in a people has been developed under storm and trial. Neither in thisgeneration nor in any soon to come will the strange blessing of final independence whichhas come to you and your people be fully understood. But for the spirit that drove youinto the wilderness to combat with the savage elements among men and the more savageelements of nature, but for the necessity of industry, courage and patience, made necess-ary by your battle for life in a country so wild and unfruitful at first as to be un-friendly, but for the strange experiences through which practically the first two genera-tions of your people have passed, your Church would never have been rooted and groundedin the everlasting strength which I believe it now holds, and the strong men you havedeveloped would never have been discovered to you. So it may come out at last that a Providence has been in it all, a Providence apparently unfriendly for many years, butwith the final proof that it was a loving Providence in the care of you all the time.Yours will be a very fortunate people as time shall come and different generations shall follow, if those who come after you shall prove as worthy, as true to everything that isright in human life and aspiration, as courabgeous in the performance of duty, as the strong and fearless men and women who first set up the standard of your Church in Utahand who so loyally and fearlessly upheld it in the first generations of your experiencein the Rocky mountains:While I never was among the American people who are intolerant toward the

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICECHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.OFLATTER-DAY SAINTS,P. O. BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T. April 1st, 1889.President W. Paxman,New Zealand.Dear Brother: Your kind and very interesting communication of Feb. 23rdreached us on March 19th. We were pleased to learn of the continued growth ofthe Church, and of the progress you are making in the printing of the Book of Mormon. Your request for $500.00 to help you meet your engagements with theprinters was duly considered by the Council of the Apostles, and in the presentstraitened condition of the finances of the Church, it was decided that the utmostwe could do was to send you the amount you ask—$500.00—as a loan. We haveaccordingly arranged that the amount be forwarded as desired by you, throughthe Union Bank of Australia at Auckland. We have also sent to Brother Marriottthe £10.0.0 due him.Among the Elders called for New Zealand was Elder Geo. T. Smith, of George-town. His health was, however, so poor that when he reached San Francisco withthe other brethren it was considered advisable for him to return, which he did 
 assisting the Elders. The London Conferenceis about 38 pounds behind with no imm-ediate prospects of ammeleorating its con-dition. I am pleased from reading theminutes of the YMMIA Conference to learnthat they have passed resolutions to withold all patronage from those peoplewho take a part in or in any way befriendthe present crusade against their parentsand friends—this action is very commendableon their part. I returned last night froma visite to Brighton. It is a very prettyplace and deserves its title of The Queen ofWatering Places. The Volunteer review tookplace while I was there. I should think 200,000 would be a low estimate of the number of people present. It was a prettysight to see 20,000 troops of all arms in their uniforms of Red, green, blue, and drabpass by in marching order 25 abreast theywere nearly an hour passing a given pointWell I will say good by, ever praying for theblessings of heaven to attend you Yours etc Asahel. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICECHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.OFLATTER-DAY SAINTSP.O. BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T. May 23rd, 1889.President William Paxman, New Zealand.Dear Brother: It was with great pleasure that we read your communicationof April 11th.  We have much joy in the progress of the work of the Lord in thelands where you have charge; and we believe that the publication of the Book ofMormon in the native tongue will have a highly beneficial effect among the natives.Yiour course in reporting to them your receipts and expenditures will also greatlyadd to the good feeling of the Saints.  The Maoris have evidently had their confi-dence shaken by the methods of sectarian missionaries in financial matters. Wemsust do our utmost to build up confidence in their hearts towards us, that theymay not only know that the Lord has revealed His gospel in these last days andmade us its ministers, but also that is fruits are manifested in our lives, andthat we have learned that all men are the sons of God and should be treated as brethren in all the relationships of life.We are pleased also to discover that you are establishing sunday scholols 
 state through this probation to its finalabode in the presence of God. I never heardsutch a discourse in all my life. Pres.Wells feels well, so does his wife and sonwho are here with him, the latter on amission. We were all enjoying the hospitalityof Bro Crass of North London last night--I say night because the greater portionof us stayed up all night in consequenceof which I am a little blinky to dayWe had an interesting entertainment towhich each one of us contributed, thushaving a jolley good time together. A numberof us are going to visite some places ofinterest to day. Miss Quayle and I havehad a final separation, I have returnedher letters and feel as if a great weightwas removed from my shoulders, and amfree. I do not regret this termination of sounfortunate an alliance. Good by and mayGod protect and keep you in his holykeeping, is the constant prayer of yourAffectionate SonAsahel H Woodruff 
 Mormon Church, being of a liberal and tolerant mind, and having acquaintances with thesection of the Mormon Church located in Iowa, made up of as good people as we had inthat State, of course I never knew or had opportunity to know fully and distinctly allthe facts in regard to the career of your Church and people in Utah and the contiguouswestern States. It was some ten years ago that in connection with Mr. Blaine, when we were studying the elements of voters in the United States to try to secure a majorityfor the political principles in which we believed, I first learned of the magnitude ofthe Mormon people, the greatness of their development in many States besides Utah, and the large part that they were sure to bear for good or evil in the destiny of this re-public. Mr. Blaine and I were both surprised to see with what far-seeing wisdom thepioneers of your people had looked into the future and had laid the lines along whichyour descendants were to play a large part in the affairs of this country. Ever afterthat both of us realized both how unjustly you had been dealt with in the past and whata strong call there was upon the conscience of every lover of his country to endeavorto see that you were dealt with more justly in the future. It was in this way, led bymy natural sense of justice and by my knowledge and by my realization of the wisdom necessary to deal with all the composite elements making up the people of our country,and my early recognition of the industry, patience, and good purpose of your people,that I came to take so much interest in your welfare and became so willing to aid inrelieving you as much as possible of the wrongs inflicted on you in the past and tosecure to you a full share of rights as American citizens in the future.It was in 1889 that the matter was projected before me so prominently, and ata time when I was in such position as to have some official power in addition to mypersonal influence, and fortunate enough to be near Mr. Blaine with his almost omni-potent influence, that I took up in zealous manner the effort to serve you to the extentof my ability. It was in this time that Colonel Trumbo, who has proved such a friendto your people as I have never known any people to have, came upon the scene, and gaveto Mr. Blaine and to me such a practical and accurate knowledge of your exact situationas to wrongs in the past and rights in the future, that we were enabled thereafter to 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 17, 1888.President W. Paxman,Dear Brother:We wrote you by last mail but, being exceedingly busy at thetime, did not answer the two questions you asked in your favor of the 3rd of Julywith regard to tracts and the emigration of our Maori converts.We shall send you an assortment of tracts by the Elders who nextgo to your field, and trust that by their means you will be able to accomplish muchgood.Respecting the emigration of the Maoris to this land, we feelled to say that for the present you had better repress any inclination of thatcharacter. If the work among the Pacific Islanders continues some provision willdoubtless have to be made for their future colonization and development. It is notimprobable that we shall be able to arrange after a while for some suitable placein a milder climate than ours, a climate the seasons of which would be like theirown, and where it will not cost so much to live as it does in our own northern land. The Sandwich Islanders are moving here in small numbers; but their position is notsuch as is best adapted for their growth in those disrections that are desirable. 
 organize and conduct a contest in your behalf on lines that we knew were absolutelyright and as absolutely sure to win for you in the end. Of course, I need not say toyou, or to any of your people, how devotedly and wisely Colonel Trumbo over several yearshas subordinated his own interests in life and made your interests the ambition and as-piration of his every effort, and how with apparently more than human energy he has de-voted every day and every thought of his life to your service. It has been almost en-tirely through his influence, through the genius of his persistence in carrying the storyof your wrongs and rights to the door of nearly every influential man in the nation, ofhis energy in assembling all these influences, and making friends for you wherever therewere good hearts to make friends with, that success has finally come to you. I have been much in politics, and in many struggles. I have seen many successful men, gifted withmasterful and even peculiar powers in human affairs; but, as Mr. Blaine and I have oftentalked and discussed, such a character as Colonel Trumbo, with his ability to make friends,his ability to make people listen as to your wrongs and his power to convince them of your rights, and his singular quality of assembling all these forces together, whetherrepresented in the public press, or in the organizations of the different churches, orthe more powerful influences of the most powerful corporations, and finally in the seatof supreme power in the United States, Congress, has never before appeared on the sceneof American politics. It is not in my nature as a devout man and a believer in higherpowers, to reject the idea that he has been given for this work even more than thestrength of a man. It is refreshing in this age of cynicism and indifference in theworld to find friendship of this higher sort sacrificing personal interest and ambitionto a good cause and putting the success of that cause above everything else. Equallymarked and equally beautiful and worthy of admiration as Colonel Trumbo's persistentand remarkable efforts in your behalf has been the unselfishness of his actions, thesubordination of self with no expectation of reward except the great joy of seeingjustice brought to you and your people at last. That you and all your people willappreciate this, that you have no confidence too sacred to be given to him, that thereis no honor within your control too high to be offered him, that your children after you 
 2They are employed as workmen in various occupations; but we think they should be incommunities where they can receive better advantages and be able to pay some at-tention to the cultivation of the soil. We shall keep this matter before us, be-cause it is one that we are already questioned upon by Brother Joseph H. Dean, whohas attained some success in preaching to the natives of the Samoan Islands, wherehe and his wife have gone from the Sandwich Islands. The prospects there for con-versions are very encouraging, and the steamer that carries this letter will con-vey three Elders and the wife of one of them to the Samoan group, they having beensent for by Brother Dean to assist him in his labors there.In line with this counsel, we think it would not be a wise movementfor Brother Marriott to bring the young Maori sister of whom you speak, as it mightunsettle the people and make them desirous also of emigrating.By the next steamer we expect the following brethren will sail for yourfield of labor: Joseph Peter Beck of Paris; Hugh S. Geddes of Preston; Latimus O.Taft of Salt Lake City and John H. Thompson ^also^ of this City; and possibly Matthias Fos-ter of Meadow. By the November vessel two others will follow; they will probablybe Orson D. Romney of Salt Lake City, and Heber J. Waggstaff of American Fork. On theOctober boat there will probably also leave William Bromley and George Edwin Wool-ley of this City. Unless other arrangements are deemed desirable between now andthe sailing of that steamer they will on their arrival labor among the friends and 
 2very reluctantly, as he was exceedingly anxious to honorably fill his mission.Since he reached home we have deemed it wisdom to entirely release him, onaccount of his poor health, and have encouraged him to the performance of thoseduties which he can perform in the midst of the saints without imperiling hislife by the changes and hardships of a foreign mission.Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now with you whom you can recommendto succeed you when you are released to return home, or do you think it willbe necessary or desirable that some Elder specially called to preside in Aus-tralasia be sent from here?We are anticipating a largely attended and very enjoyable General Conference.For the first time in several years the majority of the General Authorities ofthe Church will, in all probability, be present. Myself, Elders Lorenzo Snow, Franklin D. Richards, Geo. Q. Cannon, Moses Thatcher, J. H. Smith, H. J. Grant, John W.Taylor and D. H. Wells expect to attend, and possibly Elder F. M. Lyman may bereleased from the penitentiary in time to be present during the last day's ser-vices. Presiding Bishops Preston, Burton and Winder will also be with us. Wehope to be able during the Conference to attend to several matters of importanceconnected with the growth and development of the work of the Lord.The day after Conference will be a busy one with us. About sixty Elderswill be set apart on foreign missions, principally to Great Britain, Scandinavia, 
 3relatives of Brother Bromley in Australia. When Brother B. gets through minister-ing to his friends he will most likely return, and Brother Woolley will be subjectto your instructions as to his future labors. Should Brother Bromley not find itconvenient to go Brother Woolley will report to you for instructions on his arrivalthe same as the other brethren.This morning Brother George Q. Cannon went to the Third District Court,surrendered himself and plead guilty to two charges of unlawful cohabitation. Fora long time past he has felt strongly impressed that good to the work of the Lordand to his brethren would result from such a course. He has been impressed thathis surrender would be followed by the lightening of the burdens now imposed uponthe Saints. Thus far his anticipations have proven correct. The Judge acted withjustice and moderation, not only in his case but in these that followed. You maynaturally suppose that his act of Brother Cannon's caused a sensation, and thecourse of Chief Justice Sanford has not decreased the excitement. The great ma-jority feel that both have done well, the rabid few are intensely angry. Should the Judge continue his moderate course, I am of the opinion that other prominentmen will follow Brother Cannon's example, as it is most desirable for the growthof the kingdom and the good of the Saints that the leaders of Israel should have free access to the people to counsel, instruct and teach them as in former days.We have reason to believe that Brother Cannon will be treated with kindness by 
 shall be taught to know the value of his services, I am sure from what I know of theMormon character will be true.The story of the struggle of your people, as a people, and the later story ofthe struggle of your Territory for Statehood, are both so interesting and absorbing thatit is hard to confine any analysis of it to anything like the proper limits and spaceof a letter. But I feel it is due to you, who have been remote from nearly all thephases of these struggles in the eastern States and out of your own Territory, to betold by someone who has known of them and who can make the recital impartial somethingof the details, to be left in your records in a form that will endure as a part of thehistory of your Church and people. I take it up here with the attempt to disfranchiseyour people in Congress in 1889, when a bill was introduced to add this further indignityto the cruelties and wrongs of the Poland Act. It was then that Colonel Trumbo appealedto me for help, feeling that I as a western man, as a man who had tolerance of opinion,and especially as a man who was then in an official position of power, could help himin resisting this further visitation of wrong upon you. He and I craved of Mr. Blainethe use of his far greater power in your protection, and with his help we went beforethe committee of Congress having this proposition of further wrong before it, and wereable to defeat it. If you could have the words, which seemed almost to be the words ofinspiration, as they fell from the lips of Mr. Blaine, protesting against this furtherwrong to you, protesting against such an outrage upon any portion of a free people,asserting that no republic of free men could tolerate such a wrong and li^v^e, I am certainthat they would be treasured in the affections of your Church and people as being onlysecond in comfort and power to the words of divine speech. I have always regretted thatno report was ever made of his appeal to that committee. It came up suddenly, was veryinformal, no one thought of anything but what Mr. Blaine was saying, and he spoke sodeeply from the heart and from the best thoughts that ever arise from the human soul,that his words came almost unconsciously to him and he was never able to repeat them.I asked him afterwards if he could not, and he said that they seemed to come to him asif on wings at a great and critical time, and they had passed away as suddenly and com- 
 3Germany, Switzerland, Holland, and the State of pennsylvania. On the same daythe first Convention of the Officers and Teachers of our Church schools willbe held, to consider matters connected with the organization and conduct of ourAcademies. The progress made since the General Church School Board was organizedhas been very encouraging. Twenty Church institutions of learning are running,with an attendance, during the past winter, of about fifteen hundred scholars;and we do not think we overestimate when we say that double that number of schoolswill be in operation the next school year. There is scarcely a Stake but whathas one or more schools now open, or is arranging to commence next August. Thechief difficulty that, at present, presents itself is the lack of suitable breth-ren to act as Principals. Where they are all coming from is the question thatwe cannot now answer, but when the time comes that they are needed, we doubt notbut, as in other things, the Lord will raise up men to accomplish this portionof His work.We are patiently waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates in our appeal against the escheatment of Church property under the pro-visions of the Edmunds-Tucker law. We expected it before this, but have beendisappointed. There is a miserable scramble going on in Washington for the UtahOffices. The "ring" here are working for the re-instatement of Judge Zane, and 
 in the branches wherever practicable.  The fact that you have twenty-five suchschools now in active operation in New Zealand tells its own tale, and affords usmuch encouragement with regard to the future of the Maori Saints.  These institu-tions should be carefully nurtured, that the children of the native brethren and sisters may early learn the truths of the gospel, and the false traditions andsuperstitions of their ancestors be thereby so much lessened in influence in theirafter lives.We cannot give you any other counsel with regard to the emigration ofthe natives than we have hitherto done.  We do not regard the present as an oppor-tune time for such a movement.  Their childlike and confiding natures would un-doubtedly be terribly shocked by things that they would now-a-days see and hearin the midst of the Saints.  They must learn to abide in patience until the timewhen the Lord signifies that some change should be made in our present instructions.Encourage them to live their religion, and the Lord will accomplish all His purposeswith regard to them in His own time and in His own way.We should be pleased to have you take whatever measures you and the Eldersdeem wise and prudent to counteract the organized efforts of the ministers of thevarious denominations to injure your influence and impede your labors amongst thenatives.  Show, wherever you have opportunity, how they have progressed in truecivilization since your advent among them; that they are more virtuous, more

 pletely, and there was left to him only the memory of his indignation at the wrongproposed and of his duty to resist to the highest limit of his power such wrong andencroachment. Of course, your people know something of the courage and loyalty ofMr. Blaine towards you in oppression; but the summit and sublimity of it all wasreached when he stood in this small committee room and smote down with the giantstrength of his indignant wrath this further attempt in a free government to degradestill further a people already wronged too much. If you but knew the burning wordswith which he spoke, the spirit with which he spoke, I am sure that the name of Blainewould never pass Mormon lips without the blessing of a prayer following the spokenword or the unspoken thought.This marked the limit of the high tide against the Mormon people in Congress.Wrong had gone as far as it was possible for it in its malice to go. From that day itreceded. Having curbed it in Congress, then it became necessary to spread out thefeeling represented by Mr. Blaine over this wide nation and mollify all the great ele-ments into something of the same feeling—nearly all of which, sharing in a preju-dice and a hatred which were the more intense because of their ignorance of the facts,were almost implacable at the mere mention of the name of Mormon. Religious intoler-ance far outruns political intolerance, as you know; and, having checked the highesttide of this feeling in political circles, it then became necessary in a government ofthe people to go back to the sources of all the powers of Congress and mollify all thegreat elements toward the final and ^end^ which has now come. In surveying the field Mr.Blaine, Colonel Trumbo, and myself felt that the next step was to secure, first a larger tolerance in the Republican party, and finally the active friendship of thatparty in behalf of justice to your people and Statehood for your Territory. It hadbeen the fate of this party, driven forward by the crusade of the churches against yourChurch, to be in possession of the government and therefore to enact and enforce thelaws that public sentiment coerced from Congress in enactment against your people insome of your practices as a church. The first practical step to be taken along thisline was to take away from the so-called Liberal party in Utah, which had always been 
 4the appointment of such men as McBride, Varian and "Kentucky" Smith (Idaho) toother offices. Their hope is to get men into position to steal Salt Lake Cityand Utah Teritory politically as they stole Ogden at the last election. Someaccounts represent President Harrison as quite prejudiced on our question, othersspeak more favorably. We have hopes that he will not appoint local men to fillthe various U. S. offices in the Territory; at any rate, that he will not selectmen such as those proposed by our enemies.March has been a pleasant, warm and showery month, and the prospects forwater in some parts of the Territory during the coming summer are slightly improvedBut as a general thing the amount of snow stored in the mountains is below theaverage.My health and that of the brethren associated with me is generally good, andno contagious diseases prevail, to any extent, among the people.Praying the Lord to continually bless you and all the Elders laboring withyou, that all your efforts may be crowned with success, and with love and kindestregards,I remain your Brother in the Gospel,W Woodruff 
 sober, more cleanly, more industrious, and in every way better citizens sincethey listened to the teachings of the "Mormon" missionaries. You can vindicateyour calling and labors by the fruits that have followed, and prove that your effortshave been as priaiseworthy as the truths that you teach are impregnable.As we hoped, the United States Supreme Court at Washington has reversedthe decision of the local courts in the case of Brother Hans Nielsen, taken up onhabeas corpus from Provo. He was first committed and sentenced for unlawful co-habitation with a polygamous wife, then for adultery. The Supreme Court holds thattwo separate crimes were not committed by his living with a plural wife, and sentdown an order ordering the discharge of Brother Nielsen from the penitentiary. Hehad served his term for unlawful cohabitation and was serving out the one foradultery. We understand that Preosecuting Attorney Peters and some other officialsare much chagrined at this decision. They had hoped to introduce the segregatingsystem in a niew and very odious form. Now they must elect which charge they willproceed on. No doubt, wherever the evidence makes it possible, they will proceedagainst the brethren for adultery, as the penalty, on conviction, is so much theheavier. Arrests for the infractions of the Edmunds-Tucker law are still frequentin the remoter portions of the Territory, but not so numerous as at one time. Itis said that there are at present more Territorial prisoners in the Utah penitentiarythayn at any former time. The number of United States prisoners is less than it was 
 more an engine of injustice and oppression toward you than a representative party ofjust sentiment, and which had finally become simply a means of persecution and money-making, the apparent sanction of acting in the name of the Republican party of thenation. To do this efficiently it was necessary to dispossess this Utah Liberal partyof its membership in the Republican National Committee, and to give admission instead to the Republican party in Utah, and thus to gain entrance of the national party on thelocal ground, where it could deal in justice and fairness with your people and take upwith intelligence the preliminaries of the final settlement which has now come in fair-ness to you. To those of you who were remote and who know little of the national pre-judice and of the difficulty of assembling the support of every State in a NationalCommittee, this may have seemed a trivial matter. I happened to be Chairman of theRepublican National Committee at the time, and even I, who knew much of this prejudice, was surprised to find how obstinately the most of the members of the Committee held tothe old-time prejudice and how timid nearly all of them were as against the reproachesof their people for rejecting the Liberal party in Utah and admitting to membership inthe National Committee a party that proposed tolerance and fair play to the Mormons thesame as all other Americans. It took a year of patient effort, of direct personalappeal to almost every member of the National Committee, and more than that of system-atic work to reach the influences back of these men personally, to give them thecourage to act along the line that we proposed. It happened that the meeting of theNational Committee where Utah for the first time was admitted to fair-play representa-tion in any National Committee was held in Washington, where all the allied influencesagainst your people had their representatives on the ground for action. These influ-ences stormed at the Committee, frightened away all but the most resolute men, and madeit extremely difficult to carry the matter successfully through the Committee. But itwas finally done, and when it was done the Liberal party of Utah was for the first timecut off from connection with the supreme sources of national power. Colonel Trumbo maysometime when he is with you, in the confidence that exists between you and in the greataffection in which he holds you, give you many of the details of that first struggle, 
 some time since. The total number is now 211; at one time it reached 252.President Harrison has lately given considerable attention to Utah. Hehas appointed a new Governor and Secretary and two new members of the Utah Commis-sion. Our new Governor is Mr. Arthur L. Thomas, once Secretary of the Territory, and more lately one of our Commissioners; the Secretary is Col. Sells, a lumbermerchant of Salt Lake City. The removal of Commissioner Thomas and the resignation of Judge Carlton made two vacancies in the Board. These the President has filledand the Commission now consists of Messrs. Godfrey, McClernand, Williams, Robertsonand Saunders. The last named was at one time Governor of Nebraska. The twoDemocratic members are Messrs. McClernand and Williams; though Mr. Williams showsvery little true democratic principle in his dealings with Utah and her people.There has been much apprehension felt throughout this region that waterfor irrigation would be very scarce during the coming summer, and as a resultthe crops would be exceedingly light. But these fears have been set at rest byabundant rains in the valleys and snows in the mountains during the presentmonth. Already, in Salt Lake City, nearly two inches more rain than the averagehas fallen since the commencement of May. In some neighboring valleys the differ-ence has been even greater. As a consequence of so much rain and snow, the weatheris cooler than usual at this time of the year. In April—before the stiorm came—it was considerably warmer than the average. 
 which may seem trivial now but which was the first necessary step toward success at all.In thus helping to strike down the Liberal party by the hand of the officialnational power of the Republican party, I gave assurance to almost every Republican ofinfluence and prominence in the nation, and to everyone whose help I finally succeededin gaining, that despite of the past, when Republicanism and Mormonism were made tostand as deadly elements of opposition, the future would be one of fair play and one inwhich your people would act on the lines of the future and not of the past. There wasthe natural fear, of course, after the Republican party had enacted and enforced thesevere laws against Utah, that there would be treasured up in the hearts of your peoplethe natural feelings of enmity and revenge common to human nature. Utilizing all the facts Colonel Trumbo had given me, and nearly always having him with me to bear testi-mony to what I was saying and to answer every question that might be asked, I succeededin convincing enough Republican leaders to control the majority of the party that thefuture Mormons, all of them instinct^lled^ with patriotism and love of country, all of thembelieving in protection to American interests and industries, and all of them animatedby the common purpose of all Americans to serve the republic in its government of free-dom faithfully, would be found and indeed would be forced by their own destiny as apeople to gravitate toward the underlying principles of Republicanism and Americanism.The question was a mighty one, and nearly every prominent man to whom I talked when Irevealed to him the fact that this was not merely a Utah question but that the Mormonpeople were spread through the valleys of eight or ten western States, and that sooneror later they would hold the balance of power in the election of every Senator and ofevery electoral vote for President in these States, was apalled at the fact and afraidto trust to the forbearance of a people who had been so severely dealt with as a peopleby the Republican party. I mention these things, which were the foundations on which Ilaid our efforts to change the Republican party from being a party of opposition toyour people to one of friendship and support, that you may know how deeply the founda-tions have been laid and that you may understand the expectation and confidence withwhich the Republican party has come up so bravely at last to the line of doing justice 
 As requested by you, we have directed that a draft for £90.0.0, on the Union Bankof Australia at Auckland, be sent you to pay the return fares of Elders A. L. Stewart,Alexander Bullock and H. J. Burgess.To recur again to the question of the emigration of the Maoris, wefind ourselves perplexed as to what arrangement to make for the Sandwich Islanderswho have emigrated to this city. There is quite a large number of them now here,and the mode of life here is not suited to their proper training, and we havefelt very much exercised for their welfare. Three of the brethren who have laboredamong them on the Island—Brothers W. W. Cluff, F. A. Mitchell and H. H. Cluff—havebeen appointed, with three native brethren, to examine various locations thatwould be suitable for them to settle upon. We desire to have them separated, tosome extent at least, from the temptations of city life, where they can be trainedto better advantage than they can here. If we find a suitable place, they willmove there; and we may find it necessary to appoint one or two Elders who arefamiliar with the language to labor among them. When we have disposed of thisquestion in a successful manner, we can then perhaps take into consideration thequestion of moving the Maoris also. They are kindred races, and the course thatwill be taken with the Sandwich Islanders can also be adopted for them.We feel that you should be released from your mission. You have 
 toward you all.After this step in the National Committee, the next important chapter was toovercome the prejudice existing with President Harrison and the influences almost uni-versally exerted upon him, a man of peculiar religious prejudices and particularly opento the appeals of the more intolerant Churches, and induce him to follow out the per-mission of the law and the demands of justice and issue amnesty to all your people. Thiswas not dealing with one man, as may appear on the surface. If it had been, and that manof the tenacious and obstinate character of this President, even that would have been a great struggle. But we had to go back of him, and reach all the more intolerant Churches,all the church papers, and lay a mollifying hand upon them and their prejudices, and takeupon our lips the words of Christian peace and gospel and appeal to them that, evengranting all they said against your people, there was everything in the teaching of theChristian religion, when you had turned away from all things to which they objected, hadconformed to the law, and had as a Church under the revelation of the higher power towhich you conformed put away all these things, they should take you by the hand evenaccording to their own teaching and make you welcome with them and to equal rights in therepublic. We had to see and bring influence to bear on all the church papers; we hadto see the bishops and controlling men in all the strong Churches, especially the Catholicand the Methodist. The Catholic, it is only just to say, was more inclined to the newrule of fair play to you, while the Methodist Church was most tenaciously against it.I was sent by the National Committee during the campaign of 1892 to renew the talk I hadalready had at several times with the President in appealing to him to issue the procla-mation of amnesty. He said that amnesity meant so much that for him to issue it was tomake an end of all the contest, that if it were done at all it should be an amnesitycomplete and final and reaching all people who had come under the offense of the law,and that to do this during a campaign, when he was a candidate for reelection, would beconsidered by the prejudiced people among the Churches as an act influenced more by hisneeds and ambition as a candidate than by his sense of justice and duty as a President.He said that he feared all the church papers would oppose the act and condemn the pro- 
 performed a lengthy and faithful mission, and we do not think it wise to haveyou continue there any longer. But before you leave we desire you to appoint oneof the Elders to take charge of the Mission, and notify us who it will be. Wehear Brother Angus T. Wright very well spoken of, and the brethren generally whoknow him think he would be a very suitable Elder to take charge of the Missionwhen you leave. If your views agree with ours, then you are at liberty to appointhim and transfer the business of the Mission to him. Set him apart to presidebefore you leave, and then you can return as soon as you feel led to do so.Two of us—Presidents Woodruff and Cannon—returned a day or two agofrom a vnisit to the Sanpete Stake Conference. We had a very enjoyable time and held ten meetings during our absence, one of which was at Nephi. We saw yourson there and other members of your family, and they were in good health; andwhile in Sanpete we met your returned wife and child, and were very glad to see her.She was in good spirits and health, as well as the baby.We havo just got word that Judge Zane has been re-appointed Chief Justiceof the Territory. This, we hoped, would not occur, and have done what we couldto prevent it. It has not been our wish, nor for want of any exertion of oursagainst him, that he has received the appointment. But the Lord will control hisacts for His glory and, no doubt, for our salvation; so we accept it with resig-nation.

 clamation, and he required that I should have all the editors of these papers seen,and that I should test all the sources of power among the leading religious denomin-ations. When you realize how many there are of these papers and how numberous are thesources of religious power and authority, you can imagine something of the task that helaid upon me. It was then that Colonel Trumbo came on to help in this work, and we werefortunate enough also to have the benefit of the wise counsel and suggestion of Presi-dent Cannon and General Clawson, who about this time came to New York and remainedseveral weeks, a fact which in itself was peculiarly fortunate and almost providentialin the line of success to our efforts. Difficult as this work was, we took it up, em-ploying the help of many people, and finally secured a favorable expression from all th[e]church papers in favor of showing confidence toward your people in their changed atti-tudes, and quite a favorable expression from leading church authorities in favor of thePresident's immediate and favorable action. The amnesty therefore would have been iss-ued in October except for the affliction that feel^ll^ upon the President in the illnessand final death of his wife, when to the credit of his heart be it said everything elseeven the campaign for his reelection, was made subordinate to his duties toward his dy-ing wife. Influences counter to our wishes intruded on this effort from Mr. Elkins,then Secretary of War, ^and for some strange reason from General Tracy, then Secretary of the Navy,^ the latter being influenced, I think, through some unrelentingleading men in his Church, the Presbyterian. Mr. Elkins I think wanted to reach someunderstanding with the authorities of your Church in behalf of some friends and inter-ests he has in New Mexico. As you know, the amnesty was finally issued after the elec-tion, and this act of a Republican President following the sanction and permission ofthe laws of a Republican Congress put great power in our hands to influence all Repub-lican elements in the contest to follow.Then followed the contest for Statehood, in the winter of 1892-3. In preparing for this we reached out and with systematic effort organized into friendly influ-ences still more all the powerful elements of every State, by reaching the State Com-mittees of our party, getting them in active line of friendship in their influence onCongress, together with the members for each State of the National Committee. We alsokept up through the summer of 1892 our active efforts in mollifying all the strong ele 
 ments of the party and of the Churches, and especially of the newspapers, the latter be-ing the power that men in Congress fear more than any other, for they depend on theirhome papers to keep them right before their people and in public favor. I should notomit to state somewhere in this letter, and here may do as well, the constant effortsof Colonel Trumbo while all these things were going on, and his success in assemblingstrong influences to accomplish it, in securing favorable action toward your people andChurch in the Department of Justice and the other Departments here where confiscationof property and other outrages had been perpetrated or attempted. One of these was thedebts imposed by the Poland Act, amounting to nearly a million of dollars, which he wasthus able to save you from. Of course, these things you know as well as I; only I havefelt that reference should be made to them in this letter, which perhaps, with the papersaccompanying it, will be the most detailed statement put into written form of the strug-gles of your people to emerge from the outrages of Congressional law, to escape penal-ties laid upon you with so much injustice, and the final struggle of your Territory intoStatehood. Of course, I commit this letter to such purpose through you in the confidenc[e]that grows up between men who heart to heart have made a struggle against the mightiestof opposition in a common desire for success. I deal frankly with men, revealing toyou friends who are worthy of your remembrance and gratitude and also under a sense ofduty mentioning those who failed in the time of your need to support you with friendshipand met you with enmity and opposition instead. I do not believe in treasuring up even a sense of wrong, nor nursing resentment, nor entailing revenge. Human nature is tooweak, the grave too near, the necessity for forgiveness too apparent, for these thingsto be. They only dwarf those who entertain and exercise them, and make them appear insomething of competition and likeness with those from whose meanness they have suffered.But I do believe that every man and every people should know and should remember throughtime and generation the difference between those who win friends and those who win en-emies.There are some facts in connection with the struggle here in the winter of1892-3 that should be made known to you in the deep confidence of this letter, and for 
 you to use your judgment in making known to others in authority with you, and the actualfacts of friendship and enmity. I very much coveted and so did Colonel Trumbo the ad-mission of Utah to Statehood through a Republican Congress. Through our system of effort,through the assembling of influences reaching into every State of the Union and almostevery neighborhood, reaching into the Churches, into business elements and corporations,we succeeded in getting the bill through the House and in gaining practically a unani-mous vote in the Senate, and were defeated only by the persistence of the Chairman ofthe Territorial Committee, who, finding himself finally almost if not entirely alone inhis Committee in opposition to Utah, appealed to that thing called courtesy in the Senatein order to defeat what had become practically the unanimous desire of the Senate, anappeal in which he went so fare as to threaten to resign as Chairman if the majority ofthe Committee should overrule him and favorably report the bill. We have never fullyascertained, although we are satisfied that we know, the influences that acted upon him. They came from Utah, from the Liberal party, whose leaders never abated any of theirefforts to defeat our endeavors, and who I am satisfied have never relinquished theirsecret opposition up to the present hour. As you have already been informed, we went sofar and came so near success that through Senator Allison, who was Chairman of the Com-mittee on Appropriations and who has been, I may say here, one of our most faithful andpowerful friends throughout the contest, as to succeed in getting the gate open on thefloor for Utah to be called in from the Committee at two different times in the Senateduring the absence of Mr. Platt. Colonel Trumbo and I had arranged with Senator Allisonin his committee room to go down and give the floor to Senator Carey. Each time theSenator left us he said, "When I come back I will bring you the news that Utah is aState." He did get the chance, but for some reason Senator Carey did not get in in timeand when the gap was opened other men jumped in and utilized the opportunity. I have studied over this matter and investigated it a great deal, and I am satisfied finallythat Senator Carey erred in these matters only from lack of quickness of action. He is a loyal man, and I am now satisfied has intended to be true to your people, and hasfailed only where celerity of movement, quickness of brain and ale^r^tness of attention wer[e] 
 needed. We are pretty well satisfied now, after a whole year of investigation, that theinfluences that acted upon Senator Platt to hold him in opposition, even after we hadsecured every Church and political element who had acted with him before to appeal to him to be favorable then, came from Utah, from Lannan, Thomas, and Goodwin, and that it wassecretly exerted through Senator Dubois of Idaho. We shall finally discover all thefacts, for it is well enoughf to know even after a campaign has been fought, in guardinggainst similar occurrences in the future, all the facts in regard to treachery as wellas fidelity. I am fully satisfied that Utah would have been admitted by the RepublicanCongress in February of 1893, except for the influence exerted upon Senator Platt, whoalone defeated it then through Senator Dubois. This impression has been confirmed bythe indifference and lack of earnestness of the same Senator in the contest of thiswinter and spring. There can be no possible reason to excuse Senator Dubois against this act of justice toward Utah and its people. He had lived in a Territory where the wrongsagainst the people were merely a tithe of those against your people, and had sufferedfrom them and knew what they were. He had also received, even after he had been youropen and violent enemy, the strange and disarming thing of forgiveness and magnanimityand support. He was bound by all reasons of honor that govern in the hearts of good mento forget a past where your people had never wronged him, and after you had forgiven andforgotten it to become a faithful friend. We have means by which we shall finally ascer-tain the exact truths in regard to his action and his certain attitude. Meantime Iwould not wish you and your people to go so far as to share my positive impression thathe was the successful enemy against you last year, and that he has been, if not an activeenemy this year, at least an indifferent friend. You are making history, and with thathigh sense of justice which e^a^nimates all your actions as a Church and a people you willinsist upon knowing the whole truth before expressing judgment. We shall be able withina year to give you these facts.This winter and summer Senator Platt proved to be one of our best friends,wisest counsellers, and most potential influences.I should have stated earlier in this communication more of the names of the men 
 among the leaders in the Republican party who early identified themselves with thismovement and have as constantly served in it loyally ever since. Among the most promin-ent I may mention Senator Quay, who until we took the matter up with him and caused himto see the truth was amongst your most persistent opponents. For two years, however,he has used all his great power and influence in your behalf. Ex-Senator Thomas C.Platt of New York, who is in many respects the most powerful man in the Republican partyand who wields an unusual power in the business elements of the country, was among theearliest, and has not only served with friendship and influence but helped the Coloneland me in raising the means necessary to pay the expenses of the many difficult worksand systems we had to carry out—works which required the employment of very many people,all for purely honorable purposes and yet for purposes which required personal visits toevery considerable community in the nation. Mr. Manley, of the National Committee, Mr. Fessenden of Connecticut, Mr. Hobart of New Jersey, all also of the National Committeeand among its most powerful members, Mr. Payne, the Wisconsin member of the Committee,Mr. Kerens, the Missouri member, Mr. L. S. J. Hunt of the State of Washington, who broughtinto line nearly all the elements of that portion of the country, Secretary Rusk, nowdead, who was always active and always friendly, Archbishop Ireland of St. Paul, of theCatholic Church, Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore, Ex-Governor Warmoth of Louisiana, whohas helped us very greatly in dealing with Southern elements, Mr. George M. Pullman, andMr. Runnells, his General Counsel, who helped us very much with the large business ele-ments and corporations, Hon. B. F. Jones of Pittsburgh, Ex-Chairman of the National Com-mittee, General Russell A. Alger of Michigan, who has been exceeedingly active among greatcorporations and in church circles as well as political, Governor McKinley and Ex-GovernorForaker of Ohio, who have proved friendly at all times and active in their friendship,William A. Russell of Boston, one of the wealthiest men in New England, who has been abothactive in help and liberal in means and has drawn into it in help many of the strongestand wealthiest men of New England, Hon. F. W. Palmer, late Public Printer in Washington,who has served us with peculiar ability and fidelity, Hon. Thomas Lowry of Minnesota, andmany others I might name and perhaps ought to name, have been as devoted friends as any 
 people ever had. These are elements, as you will notice, outside of Congress. In Con-gress we had at the start the powerful help of Senator Allison, who was then the mostinfluential Republican in the United States Senate, and Speaker Reed of the House, thesetwo men furnishing out the most of the power we have utilized on the Republican side inCongress. When Congress was Republican these were our leaders and main helpers.This brings us down to the expiration of the Republican Congress on the 4th ofMarch. It is well enough to express again, with sufficient emphasis to make it endure,that it was in the heart and intention of that Republican Congress to make Utah a State.Ninety-nine out of every hundred of the Republicans in Congress favored this, the Repub-lican President desired it, the Republicans in the House did their part towards it, theRepublicans in the Senate stood ready to do it, and the whole gracious act of Republicanintention was defeated only by the strange influence exerted upon the Republican Chair-man of the Senate Territorial Committee, an influence exerted from your enemies in Utahin some strange and secret and yet sufficient manner. It is well enought^f^, and I thinkfair enough, that you and all your people should understand that the Republican party asa party in Congress and in executive power desired and intended to give you Statehood. It was only through that strange thing and its stranger power called courtesy in theSenate that your disappearing enemies in Utah were able through the exercise of peculiarpower over one Senator holding a place of peculiar advantage, that this Republican inten-tion was defeated. Let me say here clearly and plainly that this influence, whatever itwas, was not one of corrupt character, for no man ever lived who was further above cor-rupt things than Senator Platt. In some way I think this malign influence in Utah exer-cised through some Republican Senators from that region an influence on Senator Platt,making him believe that it was necessary to defeat Statehood and that the sole reliancefor this necessity was on him.This brings us to March, 1893. During the summer of [18]93 we kept in constantmotion all the influences through the organizations of friends we had perfected in everyState in the Union, not only to hold the turning tide toward friendship for you among allthe controlling elements of the nation, but if possible to increase this feeling into friendship. We had able and strong and controlling friends at every influential churchgathering, all the Methodist conferences, and all the synods and associations of the dif- 
 ferent Churches held during the summer. All the time we had felt that the coercionof church sentiment over men in Congress was the thing to be feared, for religious in-tolerance is always last to release its grasp. We succeeded well and increased our chanceamong these controlling elements during the summer; and this brings us to the assem-bling of the Democratic Congress in December. During the extra session in the summer,called by the President to meet the financial situation, our question played no part.And when Congress met in December, Democratic in both branches, with a Democratic Pres-ident, our situation had become irritated against us with the Democrats by the resultsof the various State elections held in that year, including the one in Utah, where yourpeople had elected a Republican Legislature. Nothing during the whole time in which Ihad been engaged in this movement has made the difficulty of it so plain as when it wasdemonstrated that we had to go to a Democratic Congress, with the traditional intoler-ance of the Democratic party against Republican communities and Republican interests,and ask it to make a State of a Republican Territory. 
 This danger was heightened by the fact that the Democrats held their power in the Senateby a slight majority, a majority sure to be decreased in some of the States electingSenators this year and in especial peril against the probability of Republicanism whenUtah is admitted. It was our fortune and salvation in this dilemma that we had been ablein five years of constant effort to gain the friendship of the Republican party general-ly, and to have it mobilized in such hearty manner that it was willing to play any partof honor necessary to success. But it became necessary, of course, not only to gain Dem-ocratic support for Utah, which had gone Republican, but to make the Republican friend-ship and support as unobjectionable to the Democrats as possible and as unobtrusive aspossible. The Democratic party is wise always in its generation. They were not deceivedas to the Republican Legislature in Utah, nor could they be deceived, with the WilsonBill taking the profit of protection from everything raised on Utah ground or from underUtah ground, of the tendency its people would naturally have in politics hereafter.There is no doubt that it was the settled Democratic program in December not to admitUtah, but it is also just as certain that as a party it intended to shirk the responsi-bility for this and by tactics leave the responsibility on the Republicans. It was thenthat the wisdom of our organized Republican strength was made apparent. The Utah billwas brought into the House in December from the Democratic Committee, not with the in-tention of passing it, but with the expectation and settled belief that it could be usedin tactics to Democratic advantage on the confident faith that the Republicans would oppose and filibuster against it. It was brought in with the evident intention to shutout and occupy the time desired by Republicans to defeat other Democratic measures. How-ever, when it did come this expectation was disappointed. The Republicans by followinga splendid strategy under the leadership of Mr. Reed politely informed the confidentDemocracy that instead of opposing Utah or filibustering against it they were friendlyto the people of Utah and in favor of admitting the Territory to Statehood. The bDempo-crats had gone too far, they could not recede, and therefore the bill passed—anotherstrange evidence in this unanimity of both political powers that something higher than 
 human power and wisdom has been in this matter for its guidance from the first. No onecould have believed that in the same House where for so many years the name of Utah andthe word Mormon had been used to excite bitter contests, and where the Democrats always stood to challenge the Republicans for their course towards Utah, the time had come whenboth parties would act together as one man to admit it as a State. There is a blessingin this for the State and its people, I am sure. Before leaving the question of itspassage in the House, I should say that in addition to Mr. Reed, whose powerful friend-ship was so valuable, we had also the benefit of the almost equally powerful influenceof Mr. Burrows of Michigan, Mr. Dolliver of Iowa, Mr. Hooker of New York, Mr. Babcockof Wisconsin, Messrs. Hepburn, Hull, and Lacey, of Iowa, and indeed of every one of thestronger men among the Republican leaders. The only speeches made in opposition wereby Mr. Morse, Republican, the stove-polish man of Massachusetts whose opposition wasa help, and Mr. Harter, Democrat, of Ohio, whose intolerance of speech simply emphasized the need for national sense and action.The bill therefore went from the House to the Senate bearing the invincibleapproval of unamimouss passage. Here the Democrats were placed in a dilemma. They stillprofessed to hold in cordial degree the same friendship that they undoubtedly had towardUtah and its people in previous years, notably such men as Senator Faulkner of West Vir-ginia, Senator Vest of Missouri, and Senator Coke of Texas. They assured us, since theysaw no chance of escaping and since they plainly saw they could not defeat Utah withoutputting it on the ground of objection to the Mormons and without thereby forfeiting thefriendship of the Mormon balance of power in several States, that they would pass it andgive you Statehood for the holidays. But they did not meand it. They intended to hideit away in the Committe, to keep it in the background, claiming that they were still in-terested in it but that the absorbing question of the tariff bill had relegated that andeverything else of comparatively minor importance to the rear. Thus 1893 was concludedand 1894 began. We saw very plainly that unless we could use in some way the passingchances of the current contests in the Senate and be of service to one faction in theDemocratic party as against the other, we could not win. For it was both the party in- 
 tention and interest not to admit to Statehood a Territory whose two Senators would beRepublican and change the balance of power in the Senate. In addition to this, someof the most powerful men in the Senate were opposed personally to the admission ofUtah or any other western States. I should have said further back in this letter thatall the time one of the most powerful elements we have had to contend against was theeastern prejudice against the admission of any more western States, and especially ofany more silver States. The gold people of the East realize the danger to them of morepower going to the West and to the silver States. We have had constantly to combat thisinfluence, especially amongst all New England Members of Congress, both House and Senate,and all the New York Members and all the Pennsylvania. Senator Hill of New York, the most powerful Democrat in the Senate, came here in deadly hostility to the admission ofUtah or any more western States, and sought a place on the Territorial Committee in orderto make his opposition effective and in order more securely to guard the East againstwhat they considered the danger of the admission of more silver States and Senators. Infurtherance of this program of Senator Hill's he also had himself placed upon the sub-committee of the Territorial Committee, together with Chairman Faulkner and Senator PlattFaulkner a former undoubted friend but changed into secret opposition by the secret or-ders of his party, and the latter the longtime enemy of Utah who the Democrats supposedwould continue that enmity and who could be used as a public scapegoat for the secretDemocratic opposition. Senator Gorman, the most influential Democratic members of theSenate and the guardian of the party's interest, was also actuated by this fear and be-lief that Utah would be Republican, and also by the eastern prejudice against westernor silver States. We found also as events developed not only this prejudice amongstthe eastern or gold States, but also a still more dangerous prejudice in the southernStates against the admission of any more western Territories on the ground that theywould become northern States and therefore help to decrease the power of the South.Thus we had the dangerous opposition of the mercenary interests of all the easternStates and of the political ambition of all the southern States, which, as you know,are so covetous of power for the South in the government. In the face of the develop- 
 to defeat the nomination of Mr. Hornblower. Before doing so we secured the pledges of honor of Mr. Gorman and Mr. Hill that they would favor the admission of Utah. But forthis opportunity we should have stood no show whatever, despite of all the powerfulinfluences we had assembled, to pass Utah into Statehood in this Congress. On thesecond fight, over the nomination of Peckham, these gentlemen again appealed to us andwe again organized a line and gave them success. This increased their gratitude. Mr.Hill from the first day changed about and has been our active, willing friend at anycall on our part and at every opportunity he could see himself to serve us. Mr. Gormandid not come so promptly up to the fulfilment of his promise and kept wishing to post-pone fulfilment until after the tariff bill. Indeed, it is certain that he went sofar with his power as Chairman of the Caucus Committee of the Senate, and therefore thedictator of his party in the Senate, to instruct Senator Faulkner, Chairman of theTerritorial Committee, to keep the bill in that Committee and out of the Senate. Mean-time we had been organizing our forces, and found a splendid ally in Senator White ofCalifornia, who has been from the first everything as loyal and helpful and vigilant in your interest as he could have been if he had been a citizen of Utah and one of yourown people. He has had not only this friendship but he is a man of remarkable re-sources, of experience in legislation, of determination in purpose, and peculiar facil-ity for such work. He had rendered you a service your people can never fully repay.While waiting on Senator Faulkner's movements, who kep^t^ delaying even a meeting of theCommittee to consider Utah and who kept going to West Virginia on days that had beenappointed for that purpose, and who employed every sort of tactics to keep us defeatedand yet in a good humor, we kept strengthening our lines in the Senate and also in theCommittee. Afther they exhausted all their excuses for the non-action of the Committeethey began to lay the whole blame on Senator Platt, who was the principal Republican onthe Committee. Senator Platt had still retained his opposition up to this time, despiteof our bringint^g^ to bear upon him the united influence of the party and many powerfulinfluences in New England and his own State. Finally he resented the idea of beingmade responsible for what was in reality the secret Democratic program of non-action, 
 and he also found that he could not help to discriminate against Utah because it was awestern State without alienating from the support of the protectionists in the Senatesuch western men as Senator Stewart and some others. He was too manly to bear off thesins of the secret Democratic purpose, and was too mindful of the interests of theEast to help break the protection line or let any Republican Senator vote for the Wilson or free-trade bill. Finally he came out flat-footed, declared himself for Utah's ad-mission, and wrote Senator Faulkner a letter that he was in favor of admission and thatas a member of the sub-committee of the Territorial Committee for Utah he was ready toreport favorably. This broke the line, and with Senators White, Hill and Call, Demo-cratic members of the Committee, favorable, and under the leadership of Seantor Hans-brough, a Republican member of the Committee whose services I should have mentionedearlier, we were able to stampede a favorable report from the Committee to the Senate.This surprised the Democratic line again by tactics the same as we had surprised it bythe passage of the bill in the House. After it was out of the Committee and on thecalendar of the Senate it was not longer possible for the Democrats to defeat it exceptby open opposition. I should have said at the outset of our program in the Senate wefound in Senator Hansbrough of North Dakota as valuable and helpful a fir[^ri^]end as wehave found any place in this contest. In conjunction with Senator Allison, who as anolder Senator had that acquired power which is peculiar to the Senate, and acting onhis suggestions, he has been our active and working friend and reliance in the Senate.A member of the Committee, a western man who had lived in California and other westernStates, exceedingly popular in manner and influential and respected by all who know him,he was labored day by day and constantly in our behalf, not only in the Senate and inthe Committee, but coming almost every night to our rooms to help lay our plans andprograms. Many of the most valuable suggestions have come from him in making the fight.I want you and your people to know that you never can owe more to any man outside ofyour own people than to Senator Hansbrough. He is a young man, in his first term inthe Senate, but sure to be returned and to become one of the most powerful members of this exalted body, so that his friendship in the future will be as valuable as it has 
 been in the past.The contest in the Senate has been one of such detail, changing every dayand frequently every hour in such strange manner, that it is impossible for me torecite it to you with anything like fidelity here. Suffice it to say that it has beensuch a peculiar situation that we have never been able to leave the ground. ColonelTrumbo and I have remained here since November and devoted ourselves entirely to analert, vigilant, constant watchfulness of the situation, ready to detect danger atthe first moment or to utilize an advantage at every opportunity. We have had toenter into nearly every contest unknown to the public to serve this or that friend orto gain the friendship of this or that element. We have built up our work as a stone-mason a wall, stone by stone, laying our hopes in solid mortar and rearing a solidstructure on which we felt, despite of the opinion of nearly everybody else and in-deed of all the experienced men in Congress, that we should win at last. We have hadin Senators Allison and Hansbrough and in other Senators in less degree, constantwatchfulness and service. On the Democratic side Senators White and Hill have beensupreme in help. It has taken the wisdom of many men to win this difficult fight.Among others I should mention that Mr. R. C. Kerens, whom I have already mentioned,member of the National Committee from Missouri, has come on and spent weeks of histime in our service. He is a friend to remember, for he has been both useful and faithful. ^I wish I might give you too the names of all our faithful friends.^ Indeed, you can take the Republican roll call, and I may say ofit that two thirds of the names represent loyal and active friends and the otherthird men who have been borought to friendship through influence and conscience. Thesame may be said of the mass of the Democratic Senators, who when the situation hadto be faced faced it on the side of manliness and justice and voted on the right sidedespite of their party's interest and their own secret party desire to keep the Terri-tory out because it was Republican.There is another and more delicate matter, which I have confided to GeneralClawson, who has been here with us and whose counsel and vigilance have been in the highest degree valuable, and whose courage and cheerfulness have furnished strengthand confidence to both of us; and he will confide it to you. These means, used for 
 purely honorable purposes and yet for necessary things, were raised entirely from Repub-lican sources because of friendship for your Territory and your people and because ofconfident faith that the Territory was to be identified with Republican policies and ambitions. This help has come freely, has been used wisely, and without it success couldnot possibly have been achieved. It has been used with as much honor and to as good re-sults as conscience could suggest or honesty require.In closing this letter, which is so long that I fear it may weary you but yetwhich I could not make shorter and which indeed I might have made longer under my senseof fidelity to all the friends we have found, I am constrained by such a sense of appre-ciation as I have never been called upon to feel before, to refer again to the strangelyloyal and successful and splendid service which over long years and in the face of everyobstacle and against impediments which would have dismayed any other man I have evenrknown, Colonel Trumbo has served you and your people. It has been beautiful to me to seesuch a friendship possible in the human heart. His ambition for your people, his deter-mination to lift them up out of wrong into victory, to compensate them for the injusticethey have suffered, to make them known to all the American people for their honesty ofcharacter and their purity of good intentions, and the dedication of his life to the endof making the Mormon name as honorable and as accepted in honor in the sight of everyhigh minded American, have renewed my faith in human nature. It has inspired my ownheart to see how he has been actuated also by loving friendship and devotion to you. Noson whom I have ever known could be more loyal, and no son I have ever known has served a father as well as he has served you. It has been, as he has constantly said to me,not only his ambition to accomplish this desired vindication for your people, but also toaccomplish it in your time and under your Presidency, while you were still the shepherdof your people and the hope of all our hearts.Whatever appreciation you shall show to him, whatever honor you may offer tohim, it will be deserved. In addition to the gratitude you shall forever owe him, I feel it as a sense of duty to you as well as to myself, and to the pledges I have every-where made, to say that I think he should be sent on your own motion as one of the men 
 to represent you in the United States Senate. No other man could possibly represent youto your benefit and to your vindication as he can. No dozen men nor any hundred menamong you are as well known as he is to the powerful and controlling men not only in Con-gress in this later time, but throughout the country. You know, and this is realizedprobably more by President Cannon than any other member of your people, that experienceand acquaintance are necessary in a Congressman or Senator to serve his people fully andfaithfully. If Colonel Trumbo had been a member of the Senate ten years he could not have gained more acquaintance and friendship to your advantage than he has gained now. Uni-versally the people of the country and the people in Congress look to him as representa-tive of Utah. This fact of itself is sufficient for my position. The friendships hehas formed, the acquaintance he has gained with the most powerful elements of the country,will all be in your service. Besides, no one else will ever know and therefore no oneelse could ever redeem as he can, the thousands and thousands of obligations that we haveincurred in this long contest in your behalf. He knows many things that none of you willever know, and yet things that a people or a State can no more afford to forget or failto fulfill than any man of honor. I feel my own honor involved in the representation ofthe State of Utah in Congress. This whole matter has been on my conscience as nothing inmy public life has ever been. I was the first to take up in detail the position takenby Mr. Blaine, and the first to carry it to the attention of the Republican leaders indetail, and the first to organize and assemble all the party influences in your behalf. Very much of the action taken by others has been taken on my assurance of honor that Iwas not being misled, that yours were a people in whom faith could safely be placed, andthat your destiny as a people and a State ran in the same grooves with Republican pol-icies, Republican patriotism and Republican interest. I shall feel that I am on the bond,that my honor stands for guaranty, and therefore that I am at liberty, and indeed con-strained by the highest sense of duty that can actuate an honorable man, to make known toyou the obligations which rest upon you in these sacred regards.I ought to say also, and will say in brief, that we have carried in parallelwith our contest for Statehood the material interests of Utah, that we have never for-gotten the industrial and social ambitions of your people, that we have brought to the 
 attention of everybody with whom we have come in contact the empire of natural wealthand resources and industrial possibilities in your borders, and your ambition as a people and a Church to develop a community which will be an example of American in-telligence and merit and conservative of the highest average good to every citizen, and always regardful of all true interests of the republic. The railroad enterprise hasbeen in some degree a backbone in our endeavors. This enterprise can be carried for-ward and can be made the means not only of fulfilling many obligations that we have in-curred to many prominent men whose help has been vital, but also of gaining to yourState their personal interest and valuable friendship. It is the destiny of your Stateto parallel the career of the most prosperou^s^ States in the Union, prosperous in a material sense and ranking highest in the noblest senses. Since I have become identi-fied in sympathy with your people and your ambition the possibilities of Utah have con-stantly grown upon me, and I shall find much of my future life I am sure involved withyour people and your ambitions. Here occurs to me something I ought to have said earl-ier, and that is that in securing the help of many of the most powerful elements whichhave come to our assistance I have not only given assurance that there will be no causefor dissatisfaction with the men who shall come to represent the State of Utah in Con-gress, but that the elements of discord in your Territory will be pacified or removed. I know it is in your ambition as a people to make your ways by peaceful methods, and this is the high duty of all leaders of men and of all associations of Christian people. The arch enemy of your Territory and your people has been a newspaper, ably edited,almost satanic in its ingenuity for mischief, relentless and cruel, and ever sure toremain an element of harm and injury if left to its present control. I have given theassurance that this will be changed, and I have done this confident in the action I represented faithfully the wisdom and fidelity of your intentions. I think this prop-erty should be purchased, and I have pledged that it shall be representative of Repub-lican policies, and I am willing to take it up in connection with such people as you mayassign and help to organize it or do anything in the matter which the common interestmay suggest or your people desire. The necessity for control of this engine of good or 
 evil is heightened by the fact that such people after defeat are capable of nothing butbitterness and desire for revenge. While it can never control again, it can always makemischief, it can always be a subject of annoyance and an element of discontent. Thereought to be no trouble in securing it, for the men who control it are actuated only bymercenary interests and therefore are open to negotiation and arrangement.There is another suggestion that I feel that I ought to make to you in view of correcting evil impressions in regard to Mormonism and its people in all that widerworld outside of Utah, and that is that either in Chicago or New York, and in both wouldbe better still, should you in some way secure the friendship of an influentail news-paper in each of the great political parties of the country. To me, while I have beenin five or six years canvassing this subject with the people of every State in the Unionand with people of all shades of opinion and degrees of intelligence, it has been sim-ply astonishing that such dense ignorance as well as such malicious prejudice existseverywhere in regard to the real fiber and actual character and purpose of your people.We have been exceedingly fortunate in our general arrangements and in our effort tosystematize and mobilize all the strong and controlling elements in your favor, inreaching the influential newspapers of the political parties, as well as of the Churches.After this I fear many of these publications will naturally lapse into the old-timefeeling, and offer nothing by way of resistance to the prevailing prejudice against you,nor by way of enlightenment of the public in regard to your actual merits and ambitionsas a community and a people. Undoubtedly the plowing that we have done in every influ-ential community of the nation will yield good things to you constantly hereafter; butit is very important in my judgment that you have in one or both of the great commercialcenters of the country such friendship on the part of one or two strong newspapers aswill at all times, without appearing to be special pleadsers for or special champions ofyou, defend you against false accusation, and gradually give to all the American peoplethe actual facts in regard to the Mormon Church and its good purposes, to the Mormonpeople with their refinement and education, their love of gentle things in life, theirartistic development, their ambition to rear their children and their States in all the 
 finer things of life, and their aspiration indeed to make themselves fully the equal ofany American in every test and accomplishment of civilization and refinement, as well asof Christianity. I shall find it my pleasure, as I have already done in large measure,to keep supplying to the magazines, to the houses printing syndicate letters, and allother diffusive agents, such information as will tend to correct the false impressionsexisting in this country in regard to the degree of intelligence and the measures of am-bition of your people. In the magazines you will have a hearing that will be internation^-^al as well, and along these high lines of publications read by all the more intelligentpeople of the world constant effort to render to you all actual justice on your meritswill be advisable. As I have before suggested, I think, in a letter to President Cannon,a book written in comprehensive manner by someone having the historical quality of anal-ysis and the judicial quality of fairness and some one not a Mormon, ought to be writtenand printed, giving to the world the facts as to the Mormons of today and what they are and aim to be in every feature and respect.In reading over my letter after having progessed this far, I notice that Ihave omitted any mention, in the hurry of writing, of the one man who through the longperiod of your years of trial has stood by you more faithfully than any other public manoutside of your own people. I refer to Senator Teller of Colorado, who has been a towerof strength to you in all the crises of your career, and who has stood in the Senate and acted throughout the nation whenever called upon to do so with all his power in yoursufficient defense. No public man of today stands higher in the respect of the Americanpeople than Senator Teller, and his record for sincerity, his approved statesmanship, whichhas stood the test of many contests, have all been of wonderful and saving help to you inthe last year, and especially in these nervous months of the contest before the presentDemocratic Congress. I need not multiply to you, however, any words of commendation ofthis spendid man, for he was deep in your hearts and affections even before you knew ofme, and once there will always remain with abiding appreciation.Neither do I wish to leave the impression that I fear I might have done if I left this letter with no further reference to the good work done in your behalf by influ- 
 ential Democrats in this Congress. Mr. Rawlins, your Delegate, has been faithful, capableearnest and vigilant, and has done all that could have been expected of him, and is en-titled to your gratitude and praise. In the House, such Democrats as Mr. Geary of Calif-ornia, Mr. Washington of Tennessee, Speaker Crisp, Mr. Wheeler, Chairman of the Territor-ial Committee, and many others who might be mentioned, and in the Senate such Democraticleaders as Mr. Blackburn, and finally Senator Jones of Arkansas, have constantly renderedgood and very valuable service. I am satisfied that if the settled purpose of the Demo-cratic leaders at one time to deny sStatehood in some secret manner or in such way as toleave the blame on the Republicans had been carried into the field of open attempt, leav-ing us to call upon the Republican leaders to force the bill to a passage, we could havecarried a solid Republican line in both houses, and enought Democrats of good faith andfairness would have voted with us to carry the bill. Indeed, if it should come thatPresident Cleveland should veto the bill, I have faith that we could pass it over him witha solid Republican line and enought from the Democratic side to give us the necessary twothirds. But so far as we can learn up to this time, President Cleveland is ready to signthe bill. His expressions have been favorable, his views are very broad, and his own in-tentions I have no doubt are all favorable to the measure. The only danger in that sourcelies in the secret influence that may be exerted upon him from the eastern States and thegold people of the eastern States, to which influences he is peculiarly susceptible, andto the influence of Democratic leaders from sSouthern States, who are opposed to any morenorthern States. Yet Colonel Trumbo is confident that through the President's favorabledisposition, and with the help of Attorney General Olney and Secretary Carlisle and Sec-retary Morton, he can gain the coveted Presidential approval.The delay put upon you by the terms of the bill, in postponing the realizationsof Statehood practically until 1896, were unavoidable. Without these provisions it wouldnot have been possible to pass the bill without endangering it at the White House. Thesolid Republican line in the Senate wanted to amend these features, and we could havepassed the bill as they desired it, but it was not advisable to give any partisan colorto it nor afford any partisan reason for Mr. Cleveland to disapprove it. We have carried 
 things from the first along the line of the aspiration to make it unanimous, to tran-quilize all the elements, and to bring Utah into the Union a welcome member of the fam-ily and welcomed by all elements. Things have moved in a mysterious way to this end,and the devout may well think that the hand of God has controlled in it, bringing ablessing for all time with it.I hope to visit Utah within a short time, and renew with you and your peoplethe pleasant acquaintance of heretofore, and in the freedom of such interview talk overthis great struggle and bring to your attention and knowledge many things which no doubtyou and your colleagues will be glad to know. In conclusion I wish to express my owngreat personal sense of satisfaction that I was permitted to bear a part in this diffi-cult struggle in a noble cause. It has been with increasing pleasure that I have foundin every year, and almost in the developments of every day, my faith in your people con-firmed and my good opinion increased. It has gradually grown, beginning with 1889, to bean absorbing question in my life, and it has been a pleasure for me since that period tosubordinate my own interests to the one aspiration I had come to share with you to makeStatehood certain to you, and to make it certain in such a way as would by the testimonyof the American Congress vindicate you and your people from the obloquy of the past. Iam also glad that the shepherd star of Utah, symbolizing as no other star has ever donean ambition to serve the common people, and the solidarity and destiny of all your people,has appeared in all its sovereignty and beauty upon the flag of our country during thetime of your faithful and loving administration as President of your Church. I shall al-ways account it an honor and a pleasure, to be treasured by my children and held by themin sacred memory, to have been associated with yourself, with Presidents Cannon and Smith,General Clawson, and the other good men of your membership, in this praiseworthy enter-prise of gaining justice to a noble tTerritory and a worthy people. I believe that in the blessing coming to you with Statehood, a blessing to the spirit and the pride of yourpeople, this long contest, ending successfully, will also be the means of bringing to yourState countless jmaterial blessings. It has made your resources known to all the intelli-gent people of the republic, to nearly every community, and this information will bring to 
 you speedily and in vast volume the capital necessary to develop your natural wealth, tocreate your factories, to build your cities, and to make you splendid in everything thatcommercial ambition and political aspiration may desire.Hoping you may be spared many years to continue your gentle rule over the peopl[e]you love so much, and invoking for you and all your people the highest prosperity andGod's blessing always, I am,Sincerely yours,[ James S. Clarkson ]President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah. 
 P.S. It has occurred to me, as I have read this letter over that it would not be just to let it go to you, and into the records of your people, withoutreferring to the early, continuous, and remarkably influential and valuableservices of the Hon. M. M. Estee, of California. It may seem superfluous in meto do it, since you and all of your co-laborers know in far larger degree thanI of the fact and measure of his important and devoted services. In the dignityof his strength, and with the profound respect for him in the nation, his earlytestimony to your honor and merit as a people and a Church, his ceaseless effortsto correct the wrong and false impressions of the Mormon character and purpose, andhis loyalty in attesting your good-citizenship and your patriotism and love ofthe Republic in common with all American citizens, all served you to great results,and helped potentially in changing the opinions of many leaders of public thoughtand party action. I have heard him in many social and political gatherings inWashington, New York, and Chicago, speak of these subjects; and always he convincedthe most of his hearers of the truth and justice of his opinion of the good faithand merit of the people of Utah. You will need some great lawyer, versed inconstitutional law and profound in legal wisdom, to draft your Constitution.Judge Estee, I understand, was largely the author of the original and also therevised Constitution of California—an instrument which might well be taken asthe model for your Constitution, as it was taken for North Dakota and other WesternStates. It would be a graceful act of remembering friendship to commit to Judge Estee the work of framing a draft for the Constitution of Utah.In writing this whole letter I have been keenly conscious of omittingreference to the many good works done, in line with the general effort in the nation,by men of your own fold and faith. I have fully appreciated the great value oftheir service, and yet I felt that I was not entitled to try and tell you of thegreat work done in the nation by your own people—from President Cannon, with hisalmost unrivalled abilities and fidelity, of which I have often heard Mr. Blaine 
 speak in words of cordial estimate and admiration, down through many others. But I did not feel I had any commission or indeed excuse to tell you what you alreadyknew of your own faithful men. As I have referred to it, I cannot refrain fromspeaking from my own knowledge of the especially admirable and capable workaccomplished by Mr. Frank J. Cannon, one of the younger of your influentialbrethren, but who, like Aaron, is noted among his brothers for the eloquence andgrace of the speech. Before Committees of Congressmen, before Committees of Republicans, and before popular gatherings, including a Republican NationalConvention, he has held up your standards and proclaimed your noble ambition asa people, with a persuasive force and enkindling fervor that have wrought greatthings in placating prejudice and winning the good will of good people throughoutthe nation. I have seen so much of his good and faithful work, in places remotefrom you, and in acts unknown to you, that I cannot gain the consent of my own heart to close this letter without at least speaking of the marked fidelity andvalue of his services.(Signed.) J. S. C. 
 ANNUAL CONFERENCE.The services of the Conference werecontinued this morning in the upperroom of the Temple.The Tabernacle choir sang the an-them:Let all Israel join and sing.(Music by Joseph J. Daynes; choir-isters led by Evan Stephens.)PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFMade brief appropriate remarks andthen offered theDEDICATORY PRAYER,as follows:Our Father in heaven, thou who hastcreated the heavens and the earth, andall things that are therein; thou mostglorious One, perfect in mercy, love andtruth, we, thy children, come this daybefore thee, and in this house which wehave built to thy most holy name, hum-bly plead the atoning blood of thineOnly Begotten Son, that our sins maybe remembered no more against us for-ever, but that our prayers may ascendunto thee and have free access to thythrone, that we may be heard in thyholy habitation. And may it graciouslyplease thee to hearken unto our peti-tions, answer them according to thineinfinite wisdom and love, and grant thatthe blessings which we seek may bebestowed upon us, even a hundred fold,inasmuch as we seek with purity ofheart and fulness of purpose to do thywill and glorify thy name.We thank thee, O thou Great Elo-heim, that thou didst raise up thy ser-vant, Joseph Smith, through the loins ofAbraham, Isaac and Jacob, and madehim a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, andthrough the assistance and administra-tions of angels from heaven, thou didstenable him to bring forth the Book ofMormon,—the stick of Joseph, in the hand of Ephraim,—in fulfillment of theprophecies of Isaiah and other Prophets,which record has been translated andpublished in many languages. We alsothank thee, our Father in heaven, thatthou didst inspire thy servant and givehim power on the earth to organize thyChurch in this goodly land, in all itsfulness, power, and glory, with Apostles,Prophets, Pastors, and Teachers, withall the gifts and graces belonging there-to, and all this by the power of theAaronic and Melchisedec Priesthood, which thou didst bestow upon him bythe administration of holy angels, whoheld that Priesthood in the days of theSavior. We thank thee, our God, thatthou didst enable thy servant Joseph tobuild two temples, in which ordinanceswere administered for the living and thedead; that he also lived to send theGospel to the nations of the earth andto the islands of the sea, and laboredexceedingly until he was martyred forthe word of God and the testimony ofJesus Christ.We also thank thee, O our Father inheaven, that thou didst raise up thyservant Brigham Young, who held thekeys of thy Priesthood on the earth formany years, and who led thy people tothese valleys of the mountains, and laidthe corner stone of this great Templeand dedicated it unto thee, and who diddirect the building of three other tem-ples in these Rocky Mountains whichhave been dedicated unto thy holyname, in which temples many thousandsof the living have been blessed and the dead redeemed.Our Father in heaven, we are also thankful to thee for thy servant JohnTaylor, who followed in the footsteps ofthy servant Brigham, until he laid downhis life in exile.Thou has called thy servants WilfordWoodruff, George Q. Cannon, andJoseph F. Smith, to hold the keys of thePresidency and Priesthood this day, andfor these shepherds of thy flock we feelto give thee thanksgiving and praise.Thy servant Wilford is bound toacknowledge thy hand, O Father, inthe preservation of his life from the hourof his birth to the present day. Nothingbut thy power could have preserved himthrough that which he has passed duringthe eighty-six years that thou has grant-ed him life on the earth.For the raising up of the TwelveApostles, we also thank Thee, our God, and for the perfect union which existsamong us.We thank thee, O Lord, for the perfectorganizations of thy Church as theyexist at the present time.O Lord, we regard with intense and indescribable feelings the completion of this sacred house. Deign to accept this the fourth temple which thy covenantchildren have been assisted by thee inerecting in these mountains. In pastages thou didst inspire with thy HolySpirit thy servants, the Prophets, to speak of a time in the latter days whenthe mountain of the Lord's house shouldbe established in the top of the moun-tains and should be exalted above thehills. We thank thee that we have hadthe glorious opportunity of contributingto the fulfillment of these visions ofthine ancient seers, and that thou hastcondescended to permit us to take partin the great work. And as this portionof thy servants' words has thus so mar-velously been brought to pass, we praythee, with increased faith and renewedhope, that all their words with regard tothy great work in gathering thine Israeland building up thy kingdom on earthin the last days may be as amply fulfilled,and that, O Lord, speedily.We come before thee with joy andthanksgiving, with spirits jubilant andhearts filled with praise, that thou hastpermitted us to see this day for which,during these forty years, we have hoped,and toiled, and prayed, when we can dedicate unto thee this house which wehave built to thy most glorious name. One year ago we set the capstone withshouts of Hosanna to God and theLamb. And today we dedicate thewhole unto thee, with all that pertainsunto it, that it may be holy in thy sight;that it may be a house of prayer, a houseof praise and of worship; that thy glorymay rest upon it, that thy holy presencemay be continually in it; that it may bethe abode of thy Well-Beloved Son, ourSavior; that the angels who stand before thy face may be the hallowed messengerswho shall visit it, bearing to us thywishes and thy will, that it may be sanc-tified and consecrated in all its partsholy unto thee, the God of Israel, theAlmighty Ruler of mankind. And wepray thee that all people who may enterupon the threshold of this, thine house,may feel thy power and be constrained [t]o acknowledge that thou has sanctifiedit, that it is thy house, a place of thyholiness.We pray thee, Heavenly Father, toaccept this building in all its parts fromfoundation to capstone, with the statuethat is on the latter placed, and all thefinials and other ornaments that adorn itsexterior. We pray thee to bless, thatthey decay not, all the walls, partitions,floors, ceilings, roofs and bridging, theelevators, stairways, railings, and steps,the frames, doors, windows, and otheropenings, all things connected with thelighting, heating and sanitary apparatus,the boilers, engines, and dynamos, theconnecting pipes and wires, the lampsand burners, and all utensils, furnitureand articles used in or connected withthe holy ordinances administered in thishouse, the veils and the altars, thebaptismal font and the oxen on which itrests, and all that pertains thereto, thebaths, washstands and basins.

 Salt Lake City Nov. 2nd 1891Presedent Wilford WoodruffDear Brother.Replying to your letter of Oct. 25th [18]91 inregard to me going on a Mission toScandinavia will say: In as muchas the Lord through his servants hasseen fit to call me to this work andI understand that the Lord will not call anyone unless he are willing and able toprotect and provide for him.

P. Lindquist.The above statement is correcthe is willing to go, and his wife is just as willing that he shouldgo, and she is willing to support herself by the labor of her handsElias Morris,BishopsI think bro. L. is too old to take a mission. How has he been called?Is he needed & able? J. F. S. 
 The following questions having beenpropounded, were read by President Woodruff, with the answers given by theSuperintendency:When County or Association officersare called away on missions, should their places be filled temporarily or per-manently?Vacancies should be filled, whenever they occur, permanently.Should regular quarterly conferencesbe held in each Stake?Yes, and the dates supplied the Gen-eral Secretary, so that appointments maybe made by the General Superintend-ency of officers to attend them.Should systematic Scriptural exercisesbe insisted upon?It is desirable to encourage the study of the Scriptures, and to accomplish the most in that direction, system is neces-sary. To facilitate the adoption of a simple system that will not be toostraight-laced, it is proposed that wepublish a pamphlet containing sugges-tive programmes, Scriptural subjects pro-perly arranged, etc. This will probably be done by the commencement of an-other season.Should non-members of the Churchbe admitted as members of Associations?As a rule they should not, but the offi-cers must be governed according to cir-cumstances.Should ladies preside alternately or atany time at the conjoint sessions of theAssociations or at the Quarterly Confer-ences?Ladies should not preside wheremixed meetings are held and men hold-ing authority are present.Should officers be set apart, and bywhom?Officers should not be set apart; noone is specially authorized to perform that labor. 
 ELDER W. WOODRUFFSaid the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized 52years ago, on the 6th of last April, and since that time it has furnisheda grand school for the Elders ofIsrael to be educated in, not onlyin doctrine but in the principles ofgovernment. The Priesthood is oneof the most delicate and importantgifts that was ever conferred uponman on the earth. There are manycalled and but few chosen. Manyhave been called not only to the Aaronic but the Melchisedec Priest-hood. The Prophet Joseph organ-ized the Church in 1830 and theworld have been afraid of it eversince. He organized it by revela-tion. He had no power to accom-plish what he did except on theprinciple of revelation. The inspi-ration of Almighty God is the onlypower by which any of us in ourday can do anything towards thebuilding up of the kingdom of God[.]All that was ever spoken and placedon record by the ancient prophetsand patriarchs was under the influ-ence of the Holy Ghost, and alltheir prophecies, if they are not ful-filled, will be fulfilled in the duetime of the Lord. Adam spoke bythe Holy Ghost, and his words willbe accompiished. God will not dis-appoint the expectations of HisSaints. He has set His hand to carry out the great programme ofthe iast days. The nearer we got tothe Lord the more faith we have,and the farther we are off from Himthe less our faith will be and themore likely we are to go into darkness.It requires faith in God to endure thetribulations through which theSaints are called to passand to believe that all thingswill be fulfilled spoken of by theProphets. There are tens of thous-ands who know that this is the workof God. There is no power beneaththe heavens that can prevent thepurposes of God being accomplished;What is the matter with the worldand the cause of its opposition tothis work? It simply arises fromthe fact that God has set His handto build up His kingdom and that isthe reason why the ministers of re-ligion and others fight it as theyhave done from the beginning. Hethen testified to the good counselthat Joseph Smith and BrighamYoung had always given to him andto others. He testified that neitherPresident Young nor any of theleaders of the people hadanything to do in the massacreat Mountain Meadows, but he heardthe report of John D. Lee whonever intimated that he had takenany part in the dreadful deed, andhe also heard President Young con-demn the act and express deep sor-row that so much innocent bloodhad been shed in this Territory. TheElders of Israel have never been in-structed to take life or the propertyof others but to become saviors ofmen upon Mount Zion, and they had never been counseled to do anyact which would not bear the lightof heaven and the records of theearth.Elder Woodruff spoke of the pow-er and influence of tradition withwhich so many of our people havehad to contend. The God of heavenlooks to the Elders of this people toaid and assist Him in carrying outhis purposes. The Elders should beawake to the responsibilities thatrest upon them at the present time.He referred to many of the sayingsof the Prophet Joseph and the reve-lations that came through him. Ifwe did not build up this kingdomwe should be rejected ourselves. Hehad no doubt about the ultimatetriumph of this work, neither hadhe any doubt about the fulfillmentof these revelations that God hasgiven through His servants in thesedays. He spoke of the new birth ofall who embrace the Gospel, whichtakes away the fear of death. He also related a few incidents in hisown experience. The work that theElders of this church are called toperform is such that if faithfullydone, will entitle them to glory, honor and immortality in the worldto come.He then spoke with regret of thecourse our Government is now tak-ing in sowing seeds that will bring aharvest of trouble, and if they didnot repent, they would reap anguishand death. Referring to the in-crease of evil in the world, he saidhe was 20 years old before there everwas a murder committed in the State where he was born, and nowevery daily paper teems with the re-cital of every kind of evil commit-ted in the land. He exhorted all tofaithfulness, and prayed that theSpirit of God may be with theElders of Israel during the Confer-ence. 
 GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT WIL-FORD WOODRUFFaddressed the conference in sub-stance as follows:I have been suffering for somedays with a cold, which almost dis-ables me from public speaking, yetI will try to make a few remarks upon this important occasion. Inmy view there never before was a time when all the powers of heaven, earth and hell were working in theirrespective spheres as hard as theyare now for the advancement of thepurposes of God. The Lord has la-bored from the creation to leadmen to do good and to obey suchlaws as would result in good tomankind. Whatever leads to good,we are told, is of God, and whateverleads to evil is of an opposite source.As a people we understand some-what the nature of the warfare ne-cessary in the carrying on of thiswork. We cannot expect any lessopposition than has been shown tothe work of God in past ages.There has always seemed to be a determination on thepart of the powers of darknessto frustrate the purposes of God.This has been especially the case inthis age. We know that God hasagain revealed His will and estab-lished His Kingdom. John the Revelator foretold the flying of anangel through the midst of heavenhaving the everlasting Gospel.Many declarations of Scripturepoint to the restoration of the Gos-pel in these the last days.We have gathered in these val-leys, perhaps 175,000 Saints from allparts of the world, and from vari-ous occupations. The weak thingsof the world have been chosen tobear the Priesthood, and testify tothe restoration of the Gospel. Thosewho have listened to and obeyed their messages have received theHoly Ghost, and have been led togather. If this message had notbeen from God, the people who em-braced it would not have gathered, and Utah would have still been abearen desert. Since the Saintsgathered they have had the sametrials and temptations which theSaints in all ages have had to con-tend with. The hosts of evil spir-its who were cast down out ofheaven, are warring against theSaints and all good men.We have different organizationsof our youth for their proper spirit-ual training. There are the Pri-maries, where the little children aretaught truths of the Gospel; also theSabbath schools, which embrace 60,000 children. Thank God thereare so many. From these the youthprogress and become members ofthe Mutual Improvement Associa-tions.I regard the work awaiting the youth of this people as equal in im-portance to that which ever lay be-fore a class of young men andwomen on earth. It rests upon them to take the kingdom of Godand bear it forth; to stand in the midst of the judgments which arecoming upon the earth. I regardthe present generation as lying in asdeep darkness as any that ever livedupon the earth. A thousand mur-ders are committed now where therewas one seventy or eighty years ago.The Kingdom of God, its keysand Priesthood, are here, and Iwant to say to my young brethrenwho are present: Lead your fellows from that which is evil, and lay aside everything which corruptseither mind or body. No man caninherit a kingdom of glory withoutabiding the law of that kingdom,and we are all aiming, or should be,for a celestial kingdom.Nine out of ten of the young missionaries now being sent abroadare chosen from the Mutual Im-provement Associations. The mem-bers of these organizations are pre-paring themselves for the ministry.In company with some of mybrethren I have the honor to be as-sociated with these institutions, but Ihave not much time to spend withthem.In 1844 about 7000 persons werebaptized in England; but now thelabors of our missionaries are likegathering grapes after the vintage isdone. If an Elder, during a mis-sion of two or three years, baptizeshalf a dozen or a dozen persons, he thinks he has done a good work; andhe has.Young men, leave grog shopsalone; avoid everything that isevil; remember that you have a lawto obey and never break it. Keepthe law of purity and chastity.I pray God to help you to com-prehend your positions, duties and labors. I am sometimes asked whydoes not God preserve His Saintsfrom persecution and temptation?God has His own way to deal withmen. In no age has He kept Hispeople from contact with persecu-tion and temptation. We have tomeet these things; therefore prepareyourselves for them.I ask God to bless you all, to guide you and preserve you, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 
 selves, and all books, documents, andpapers appertaining to the office of therecorder, likewise the library with allthe books, maps, instruments, etc., thatmay belong thereto. We also presentbefore thee, for thine acceptance, all theadditions and buildings not forming apart of the main edifice, but being ap-pendages thereto; and we pray thee tobless all the furniture, seats, cushions,curtains, hangings, locks and fasteningsand multitudinous other appliances andappurtenances found in and belongingto this Temple and its annexes, with allthe work of ornamentation thereon, thepainting and plastering, the gilding andbronzing, the fine work in wood andmetal of every kind, the embroideryand needlework, the pictures and stat-uary, the carved work and canopies. Also the materials of which the build-ings and their contents are made or composed—the rock, lime, mortar andplaster, the timbers and lath, the woodof various trees, the gold and silver, thebrass and iron, and all other metals, thesilk, wool, and cotton, the skins andfurs, the glass, china and precious stones,all these and all else herein we humblypresent for thine acceptance and sancti-fying blessing.Our Father in heaven, we presentbefore thee the altars which we have prepared for thy servants and hand-maidens to receive their sealing bless-ings. We dedicate them in the name ofthe Lord Jesus Christ, unto thy mostholy name, and we ask thee to sanctifythese altars that those who come untothem may feel the power of the HolyGhost resting upon them, and realizethe sacredness of the covenants theyenter into. And we pray that our cove-nants and contracts which we make withthee and with each other may be di-rected by thy Holy Spirit, be sacredlykept by us, and accepted by thee, andthat all the blessings pronounced maybe realized, by all thy Saints who cometo these altars, in the morning of theresurrection of the just.O Lord, we pray thee to bless andsanctify the whole of this block or piece of ground on which these buildingsstand, with the surrounding walls andfences, the walks, paths, and ornamentalbeds, also the trees, plants, flowers and shrubbery that grow in its soil; maythey bloom and blossom and becomeexceedingly beautiful and fragrant; andmay thy Spirit dwell in the midst thereof,that this plot of ground may be a placeof rest and peace, for holy meditationand inspired thought.Preserve these buildings, we beseechthee, from injury or destruction by flood or fire; from the rage of the elements,the shafts of the vivid lightning, theoverwhelming blasts of the hurricane,the flames of consuming fire, and theupheavals of the earthquake, O Lord,protect them.Bless, we pray thee, Heavenly Father, all who may be workers in this house.Remember continually thy servant whoshall be appointed to preside within itswall, endow him richly with the wisdomof the Holy Ones, with the spirit of hiscalling, with the power of his Priest-hood, and with the gift of discernment.Bless, according to their calling, hisassistants and all who are associatedwith him in the performance of the ordinances,—baptisms, confirmations,washings, anointings, sealings, endow-ments, and ordinations which are per-formed herein, that all that is done maybe holy and acceptable unto thee, thouGod of our salvation. Bless the record-ers and copyists, that the records of theTemple may be kept perfect, and with-out omissions and errors, and that theymay also be accepted of thee. Bless, intheir several positions, the engineers,watchmen, guards, and all others whohave duties to perform in connectionwith the house, that they may performthem unto thee with an eye single to thyglory.Remember also in thy mercy all thosewho have labored in the erection of thishouse, or who have, in any way, by theirmeans or influence aided in its comple-tion; may they in no wise lose theirreward.O thou God of our fathers Abraham,Isaac and Jacob, whose God thou de-lightest to be called, we thank thee withall the fervor of overflowing gratitudethat thou hast revealed the powers bywhich the hearts of the children arebeing turned to their fathers and thehearts of the fathers to the children,that the sons of men in all their genera-tions can be made partakers of theglories and joys of the kingdom ofheaven. Confirm upon us the spirit ofElijah, we pray thee, that we may thusredeem our dead and also connect our-selves with our fathers who have passedbehind the veil, and furthermore seal upour dead to come forth in the first resur-rection that we who dwell on earth maybe bound to those who dwell in heaven. We thank thee for their sake who havefinished their work in mortality, as wellfor our own, that the prison doors havebeen opened, that deliverance has beenproclaimed to the captive, and the bondshave been loosened from those who werebound. We praise thee that our fathers,from last to first, from now back to the beginning, can be united with us inindissoluble links, welded by the holyPriesthood, and that as one great familyunited in thee and cemented by thypower we shall together stand beforethee, and by the power of the atoningblood of thy Son be delivered from allevil, be saved and sanctified, exaltedand glorified. Wilt thou also permitholy messengers to visit us within thesesacred walls and make known unto uswith regard to the work we should per-form in behalf of our dead. And, as thou hast inclined the hearts of manywho have not yet entered into covenantwith thee to search out their progenitorsand in so doing they have traced theancestry of many of thy Saints, we praythee, that thou wilt increase this desirein their bosoms, that they may inthis way aid in the accomplishment ofthy work. Bless them, we pray thee, intheir labors, that they may not fall into errors in preparing their genealogies;and furthermore, we ask thee to openbefore them new avenues of information,and place in their hands the records of the past, that their work may not onlybe correct but complete also.O thou Great Father of the spirits ofall flesh, graciously bless and fullyqualify those upon whom thou hastplaced a portion of thine authority andwho bear the responsibilities and powersof the Priesthood which is after theorder of thy Son. Bless them all fromfirst to last, from thy servant who repre-sents thee in all the world to the latestwho has been ordained to the Deacon'soffice. Upon each and all confer thespirit of their calling, with a compre-hension of its duties and a loving zeal tofulfil them. Endow them with faith,patience and understanding. May their lives be strong in virtue and adornedwith humility; may their ministrationsbe effectual, their prayers be availingand their teachings the path of salvation.May they be united by the Spirit and power of God in all their labors, and inevery thought, word and act may theyglorify thy name and vindicate the wis-dom that has made them kings andpriests unto thee.For thy servants of the First Presi-dency of the Church we first of all pray.Reveal, in great clearness, thy mind andwill unto them in all things essential forthe welfare of thy people; give themheavenly wisdom, abounding faith andthe power and gifts necessary to enablethem to preside acceptably unto theeover the officers and members of thyChurch. Remember in love thy servantwhom thou has called to be a Prophet,Seer and Revelator to all mankind, whosedays have been many upon the earth;yet lengthen out his span of mortal life,we pray thee, and grant unto him all thepowers and gifts, in their completeness,of the office thou hast conferred uponhim; and in like manner bless his asso-ciates in the Presidency of thy Church.Confer upon thy servants the, TwelveApostles, a rich endowment of thySpirit. Under their guidance maythe Gospel of the kingdom go forth into all the world, to be preached to allnations, kindreds, tongues, and people,that the honest in heart in every landmay hear the glad tidings of joy andsalvation. Overrule, we pray thee, inthe midst of the governments of theearth, that the barriers that now standin the way of the spread of thy truths may be removed, and liberty of con-science be accorded to all peoples.Remember in loving kindness thyservants, the Patriarchs. May they befull of blessings for thy people Israel.May they bear with them the seeds ofcomfort and consolation, of encourage-ment and blessing. Fill them with theHoly Spirit of promise, and be gracious-ly pleased to fulfill their words ofprophecy, that thy name may be extolledby the people of thy Church and theirfaith in thee and in the promises of thyministering servants be increasinglystrengthened.With thy servants of the Twelve, bless their associates the Seventies;may they be powerful in the preaching ofthy word and in bearing it to the fourquarters of the earth. May an ever-widening way be opened before themuntil they shall have raised the Gospelstandard in every land and proclaimedits saving truths in every tongue, that all[t]he islands and the continents may re-joice in the testimony of the great workthou art in these latter days performingon the earth.Bless abundantly, O Lord, the High Priests in all the varied duties and posi-tions to which thou hast called them. Asstanding ministers of thy word in themultiplying Stakes of Zion, wilt thouendow them richly with the spirit oftheir exalted callings. As Presidents,Counselors, Bishops, members of HighCouncils, and in every other officewhich their Priesthood gives them theright to fill, may they be righteousministers of thy holy law, loving fathersof the people, and as judges in the midstof the Saints may they deal out just andimpartial judgment tempered with mercyand love.So also, in their various callings, con-fer precious gifts of wisdom, faith andknowledge upon thy servants the Elders, 
 Sept 13th [188]7.Elder Lot SmithMormon Dairy, Yavapai Co. A.

Haveyou got through with the settlement? What has it left you?Do you own the Dairy or any of it? If so, how much?Do you own the spring at the dairy? If you own half of it, who owns the best? How many Horses, Cattle and Sheep have you left? After the settlement how is yourfamily? Where do you live? What is the name of yourPost office? 
 Priests, Teachers, and Deacons, that allmay diligently perform their part in theglorious labors thou hast called thyPriesthood to bear.Forget not, we beseech thee, thy ser-vants the missionaries, who are pro-claiming the saving truths that thou hastrevealed for man's redemption to the millions who are now overshadowed bydeep spiritual darkness. Preserve themfrom all evil, deliver them from mobviolence, may they want no good thing,but be greatly blessed with the gifts andpowers of their ministry. Rememberalso their families that they may besustained and comforted by thee and becherished and cared for by thy Saints.We pray thee for the members of thyholy Church throughout all the world,that thy people may be so guided andgoverned of thee, that all who professto be and call themselves Saints may bepreserved in the unity of the faith, inthe way of truth, in the bonds of peaceand in holiness of life. Strengthen theweak, we pray thee, and impart thySpirit unto all.Our Father, may peace abide in allthe homes of thy Saints; may holyangels guard them; may they be encom-passed by thine arms of love; mayprosperity shine upon them, and maythe tempter and the destroyer be re-moved far from them. May the days ofthy covenant people be lengthened outin righteousness, and sickness and dis-ease be rebuked from their midst. Maythe land they inhabit be made fruitful bythy grace; may its waters be increasedand the climate be tempered to the com-fort and need of thy people; maydrought, devastating storms, cyclones,and hurricanes be kept afar off, andearthquakes never disturb the landwhich thou hast given us. May locusts,caterpillars and other insects not de-stroy our gardens and desolate ourfields; but may we be a people blessedof thee in our bodies and spirits, in ourhomes and habitations, in our flocksand herds, in ourselves and our posterity,and in all that thou hast made us stew-ards over.Now pray we for the youth of Zion—the children of thy people; endow themrichly with the spirit of faith and righteousness and with increasing lovefor thee and for thy law. Prosper all theinstitutions that thou hast established in our midst for their well-being. Give toour Church schools an ever-increasingpower for good. May thy Holy Spiritdominate the teachings given thereinand also control the hearts and illuminethe minds of the students. Bless mar-velously thy servants, the GeneralSuperintendent, and all the principals,teachers and other officers, and also thosewho form the General Board of Educationof thy Church. Remember likewise inthy loving kindness the Sunday schools,with all who, either as teachers or schol-ars, belong thereto; may the influence ofthe instruction given therein broadenand deepen, to thy glory and the salva-tion of thy children, until the perfectday. Bless the members of the GeneralBoard of the Deseret Sunday SchoolUnion with the wisdom necessary forthe proper fulfillment of their duties andfor the accomplishment of the purposesfor which this board was created.We also uphold before thee the YoungMen's and Young Ladies' Mutual Im-provement associations, with all theirofficers, general and local, and the members. May they be prospered ofthee, their membership be enlarged and the good that they accomplish increasewith every succeeding year. For thePrimaries and Religion classes we also seek thy constant blessing and guiding care; may the spirit of instruction bepoured out upon the presidents andassociate officers and teachers. Maythey keep pace with the rest of the edu-cational establishments in thy Church,so that from their earliest years ourchildren may be diligently brought up inthe ways of the Lord, and thy name bemagnified in their growth in virtue andintelligence.Nor would we forget, O Lord, thenormal training classes among the peo-ple, whether these classes be connectedwith the Church schools, the Improve-ment associations or the Sundayschools. Grant that these classes maybe the means of spreading true educa-tion throughout all the borders of theSaints by the creation of a body ofteachers who will not only be possessedof rare intelligence but be filled alsowith the spirit of the Gospel, and bepowerful in the testimony of thy truthand in implanting a love for thee and forthy works in the hearts of all whomthey instruct.We would hold up before thee, OLord, the Relief Societies with all theirmembers; and all those who preside intheir midst according to their callingsand appointments, general or local.Bless the teachers in their labors of mercy and charity, who, as ministeringangels, visit the homes of the sick andthe needy, bearing succor, consolationand comfort to the unfortuate and sor-rowful. And bless, we beseech thee,most merciful Father, the poor of thypeople, that the cry of want and suffer-ing may not ascend unto thee from the midst of thy Saints whom thou hastblessed so abundantly with the comfortsof this world. Open up new avenuesby which the needy can obtain a liveli-hood by honest industry, and also in-cline the hearts of those blessed moreabundantly, to give generously of theirsubstance to their, in this respect, lessfavored brethren and sisters, that thoumayest not have reason to chide usfor the neglect of even the least amongthy covenant children.O God of Israel, turn thy face, wepray thee, in loving kindness towardthy stricken people of the House ofJudah. Oh, deliver them from thosethat oppress them. Heal up theirwounds, comfort their hearts, strengthentheir feet, and give them ministers afterthine own heart who shall lead them asof old, in thy way. May the days oftheir tribulation soon cease, and they beplanted by thee in the valleys and plainsof their ancient home; and may Jerusa-lem rejoice and Judea be glad for the multitude of her sons and daughters, forthe sweet voices of children in herstreets, and the rich outpouring of thysaving mercies upon them. May Israelno more bow the head, or bend the neckto the oppressor, but may his feet bemade strong on the everlasting hills, never more, by violence, to be banishedtherefrom, and the praise and the gloryshall be thine.Remember in like pity the dwindlingremnants of the House of Israel, de-scendants of thy servant Lehi. Restorethem, we pray thee, to thine ancientfavor, fulfill in their completeness thepromises given to their fathers, andmake of them a white and delightsomerace, a loved and holy people as informer days. May the time also be nighat hand when thou wilt gather the dis-persed of Israel from the islands of thesea and from every land in which thouhast scattered them, and the ten tribesof Jacob from their hiding place in thenorth, and restore them to communionand fellowship with their kinsmen ofthe seed of Abraham.We thank thee, O God of Israel, thatthou didst raise up patriotic men to laythe foundation of this great Americangovernment. Thou didst inspire themto frame a good Constitution and lawswhich guarantee to all of the inhabitantsof the land equal rights and privileges toworship thee according to the dictates oftheir own consciences. Bless the offi-cers, both judicial and executive. Con-fer abundant favors upon the President,his Cabinet, and Congress. Enlightenedand guided by thy Spirit, may they main-tain and uphold the glorious principlesof human liberty. Our hearts are filledwith gratitude to thee, our Father inheaven, for thy kindness unto us insoftening the hearts of our fellow citi-zens, the people of this nation, towardsus. That which thou hast done hasbeen marvelous in our eyes. We thankthee that thou didst move upon theheart of our President to issue a generalamnesty; that thou hast removedprejudice and misunderstanding fromthe minds of many of the people con-cerning us and our purposes, and theyare disposed to treat us as fellowcitizens, and not as enemies. In thisholy house we feel to give thee glorytherefor, and we humbly ask thee toincrease this feeling in their hearts.Enable them to see us in our true light.Show unto them that we are their friendsthat we love liberty, that we will joinwith them in upholding the rights of thepeople, the Constitution and laws of ourcountry; and give unto us and ourchildren an increased disposition to al-ways be loyal, and to do everything inour power to maintain constitutionalrights and the freedom of all within theconfines of this great Republic.Remember in mercy, O Lord, thekings, the princes, the nobles, the rulersand governors, and the great ones of the earth, and likewise all the poor, theafflicted and the oppressed, and indeed,all people, that their hearts may besoftened when thy servants go forth tobear testimony of thy name, that theirprejudices may give way before thetruth, and thy people find favor in theireyes. So control the affairs of the na-tions of the earth, that the way may beprepared for the ushering in of a reignof righteousness and truth. We desireto see liberty spread throughout theearth, to see oppression cease, the yokeof the tyrant broken, and every des-potic form of government overthrownby which thy children are degraded andcrushed, and prevented from enjoyingtheir share of the blessings of the earth, which thou hast created for their habi-tation.O God, the Eternal Father, thouknowest all things. Thou seest thecourse thy people have been led to takein political matters. They have, in manyinstances, joined the two great nationalparties. Campaigns have been enteredupon, elections have been held, andmuch party feeling has been engendered.Many things have been said and donewhich have wounded the feelings of thehumble and the meek, and which havebeen a cause of offense. We beseechthee, in thine infinite mercy and good-ness, to forgive thy people wherein they

 have sinned in this direction. Show them, O Father, their faults and theirerrors, that they may see the same in thelight of thy Holy Spirit, and repenttruly and sincerely, and cultivate thatspirit of affection and love which thouart desirous that all the children of menshould entertain one for another, andwhich thy Saints, above all others,should cherish. Enable thy peoplehereafter to avoid bitterness and strife,and to refrain from words and acts in political discussions that shall createfeeling and grieve thy Holy Spirit.Heavenly Father, when thy people shall not have the opportunity of enter-ing this holy house to offer their suppli-cations unto thee, and they are op-pressed and in trouble, surrounded bydifficulties or assailed by temptation,and shall turn their faces towards thisthy holy house and ask thee for deliver-ance, for help, for thy power to be ex-tended in their behalf, we beseech thee to look down from thy holy habitationin mercy and tender compassion uponthem, and listen to their cries. Orwhen the children of thy people, inyears to come, shall be separated,through any cause, from this place, andtheir hearts shall turn in remembrance of thy promises to this holy Temple,and they shall cry unto thee from thedepths of their affliction and sorrow toextend relief and deliverance to them,we humbly entreat thee to turn thine earin mercy to them; hearken to their cries,and grant unto them the blessings forwhich they ask.Almighty Father, increase within usthe powers of that faith delivered toand possessed by thy Saints. Strengthenus by the memories of the glorious de-liverances of the past, by the remem-brance of the sacred covenants that thouhast made with us, so that, when evilovershadows us, when trouble encom-passes us, when we pass through thevalley of humiliation, we may not falter,may not doubt, but in the strength ofthy holy name may accomplish all thyrighteous purposes with regard to us,fi[l]l the measure of our creation, andtriumph gloriously, by thy grace, overevery besetting sin, be redeemed fromevery evil, and be numbered in thekingdom of heaven amongst those whoshall dwell in thy presence forever.And now, our Father, we bless thee, we praise thee, we glorify thee, weworship thee, day by day we magnifythee, and give thee thanks for thy greatgoodness towards us thy children, andwe pray thee in the name of thy SonJesus Christ, our Savior, to hear theseour humble petitions, and answer usfrom heaven, thy holy dwelling place, where thou sittest enthroned in glory,might, majesty, and dominion, and withan infinitude of power which we, thymortal creatures, cannot imagine, muchless comprehend. Amen and Amen.

 Eighteen hundred and forty four entered with acold blustering snow storm. I spent the day plasteringand white washing the Printing OfficeOn the 3rd a Court of Inquiry washeld at Joseph's Store concerning William and Wilson Lawand William Marks. William Law proffessed tobeleive that Joseph had instructed the police to kill himbut the pact was thus the Law's had turned traitorsand were in reality seeking the life of Joseph by brewingmischief. A second court was held on the 5th uponthe same matterOn the 7th Mrs Woodruff andmyself met with the quorum and we had an interestingtime of instruction. I spoke during the day uponthe relationships which we sustain to our posterity andprogenitures in the resurrection. We returned homeand offered up prayers for the salvation of our friendsand retired to rest.During the month of January Elder Taylor

The [keys] are tobe [delivered] the [Spirit] of [Elijah] is to come the Gospelto be established the Saints of God gathered Zion [built]up and the Saints to [come] up as Saviours[ and [illegible] Zion]But how are they to become Saviours on Mount Zion?

The Saints [illegible] none too

I would answer no; notwith the fulness of salvationJesus said there were manymansions in his Fathers Kingdom and he wouldgo and prepare a place for them. ('House" in the[tess] should have been translated kingdom}. Anyperson who is called to the had toabide a celestial law and the whole law too; buthere has been a great diffuculty in getting anythinginto the hearts of this Generation. It has been 
 srlike splitting hemlock knetts with a corn dogger for a wedgeand a pumpkin for a beltte. Ran the Saints are show to understand. I have tried for a number of years to preparethe minds of the Saints to receive the things of God; butwe frequently see some of them after suffering all they havefor the work of God fly to pieces like glassas seen as anythingcomes that is contrary to their traditions. They cant standthe fire at all. How many will be able to abide acelestial law and go through and recieve their exaltationI am unable to say; but many are called and feware chosen."On the 15th I met with the quorum of the Twelve at the house of President Young. Orson Hyde who hadnot been with us for some time was presentand receivedhisLast evening I again met with themat the same place and Orson Prattrecieved hisOn the evening following we met atJoseph's Store.

 Two evenings later at the house of President Young John and Leonora Taylor received thierand Sealing. On the next George A Smith andsister Smith received their andsealing and two evenings after W. H. [Phelp] and wife reveived theirs.There was at this time quite arevival throughout Nauvoo and an enquiring afterthe things of God by all the quorums ofthe ChurchgenerallyJoseph's DreamIn the Office of the Prophet on the 3rd ofFeb I wasconversing with Willard Richards whenJoseph came in with W. W. Phelps and he relatedto us the following dream"I was standing on a peninsula inthe midst of a large body of water when there appearedto be a large [barbour] or a pier built out for boatsto come into. I was surrounded by my friends and while looking at this barbour I saw a steam-boat approaching it. There were bridges on the pier for persons to cross and there came up a windand 
 But it was not long before I saw them starting out into thechannel or main body of water again. The storms wereraging and the waters rough. I said to my friends thatif they did not understand the signs and the times andthe spirit of prophecy they would be apt to be lost. It wasbut a few moments after when we saw the waves breakover the boat and she soon foundered and went downwith all on board and perishedThe storm amd waters were stil very rough; yet I told my friends around me thatI beleived I could stay those waves and storm andswim in the waters better than the steam boatdid and that at any rate I was determined to tryit. But my freinds laughed at me and told me that I could not stand the storm at allbut should be drowned.The waters looked clear and beautiful though exceedingly rough and I said that I beleived I could swim and that I would try itanyhow. They said I should drown. I answeredthat I would have a frolic on the water first if  I did and I drove dived off into the raging waves. I hadswam but but a short distance when a towering waveoverwhelmed me for a time but I soon found myselfupon the top of it. I met the second wave inthe same way and for a while I struggled hard to live in the midst of the storm and waves; but I soon found that I gained upon every wave and stemmedthe torrent better and better. I soon had powerto swim with my head out of water so the wavesdid not break over me at all and I found that I swam a great distance. In looking aboutme I saw my brother Samuel by my side 
 I asked him how he liked it and he said first rate and I thought so too. I was soon enabled to swim with my head and shoulders out of water and I could swimas fast as any steamboat. In a little time it became calm and I could rush through the water onlygoing in up to my loins. Soon I only went in upto my knees and finally I could tread upon the top of the water and went almost with the speed of an arrowI said to Samuel se[e] how swift I can go and thought it was great pleasure to travel with such speed and I awoke."I continued to meet from time to timewith my quorum for the giving of the [redacted]]redacted].Why Joseph was candidate for the Presidential ChairA congregation of the citizens met in the room over Joseph's store to hear his view upon the affairsof government which had been written and was read by W. W. Phelps.Joseph gave his reasonsfor permitting his name to go forth as a candidate for the presidency of the United States. He said"I would not have suffered my name to have been used by my friends or anywiseas President of the United States or candidate for that office if I and my friends could have had the privilege of enjoying our religions and civil rights as American citizens even those rights which 
 the Constitution guarantee unto all her citizens alike. Butthis we as a people have been denied from the beginningPersecution has rolled upon our heads from time to timefrom portions of the United States like peels of thunderbecause of our religion and no portion of the Governmentas yet has steped forward for our relief and underview of these things I feel it to be my right andprivilege to obtain what influence and power I can lawfullyin the United States for the protection of injuredinocence and if I loose my life in a good cause Iam willing to be sacrificed on the alter of virtue righteousnessand truth in maintaining the laws and Constitution ofthe United States if need be for the general good ofmankind."Many other interesting remarks weremade. He was followed by Elders Hyde and Taylorand a unanimous vote was passed by the assembly to support Joseph.On the 20th I met in Councilin the morning with the Presidency and Twelve. Twomessengers arrived from the Pine County with wordfrom Lyman Wight wanting counsel concerning preachingto the Indians. Joseph thought it wisdom notto do it and said that if Lyman Wight did ithe must do it upon his own responsibility and concludednot to send him any counsel but to let him actwith the best wisdom he had.Next day I again On the 21st of Feb met with thequorum of the Twelve at Joseph's store and accordingto Joseph's counsel we sellected a company to goon an exploring expedition to California and selecta spot to build a city. Jonathan DunhamDavid Fulmer Phineas Young Alphonzo Young 
 and Elders Yerslay Emmett were named for that expeditionWhile we were holding this council the RevD. Wolfe an Episcopalian clergyman was preaching toa congregation of Saints in the other room. Whenhe closed President Joseph Smith followed and amongother remarks he said"Men may preach and practice everythingexcepting that which God commands us to do and theywill be damned at last. We may tithe our 'rue''annis' and 'commin' and still not obey the commandmentsof God. The object with me is to obey and teachothers to obey God in just what He tells us todo. It mattereth not whether the principle is popularor unpopular I will always maintain a trueprinciple even if I stand alone in it."On the evening of Sunday the 25I met with the quorum and had an interesting timeWe had received information concerning the death ofJoseph Duncon and Governor Reynolds of Missouriwho shot himself through the head. They weretwo of the most inveterate enemies against theLatter-day Saints. This called forthA Notable Prophecy of JosephHe prophesied that within five years we shouldbe rid of our old enemies whether they were apostatesor of the world and wished us to record it thatwhen it came to pass we need not say we had forgotton his sayingBy special appointment a large assembly of Saints met on Thursday the 7th of Marchfor the purpose of announcing the progress of the 
 Temple &c The quorum of the Twelve and Temple Committewere present with about seven or eight-thousand SaintsHymns were sung and prayer offered up byParley P. Pratt and then Elder Young arose and observed thatthe Patriarch was next and Hyrum came to the stand andspoke to the assembly. He saidThe object of this meeting is to stirup your minds by way of remembrance  It is necessaryto have a starting point to build the Temple. With theassistance of the sisters we expect to get the nails andglass and with the assistance of the brethren we intendto do the rest. I will proclaim in public and privatethat the sisters bought the glass and nails by pennysubscription. Choose ye this day whom yewill serve!We shall call upon this vastmultitude for a donation to buy powder and fuse ropeto blast the rocks in the quarry. We want thebrethren to do as much as the sisters. We donot intend to finish the Nauvoo House thisseason but to finish the Temple or the wallsof it this Summer get the roof on by Decemberand do the inside next winter and in about ayear from this Spring we will dedicate itWe can do anything we undertake We havepower and we can do great thingsIn five years to come the workwill progress more than it has in ten years of the past. Isaiah said we should perform a marvellouswork and a wonder. I do not marvel that hesaid so if he saw this vast multitude and Ithink this people are abundantly able to buildthis Temple and much depends upon it. Our 
 endowments and sealing powers and many blessings dependupon it."The Prophet arrived and took the standand arose in the midst of the congregation and said"Orson Pratt come and take your place" andthen continued:"I do not know whether the object ofthe meeting has been told or not. I apologize fornot coming sooner.I have had so much on mymind since I saw you that I hardly know whereto begin; but one of the grand objects which I hadin view in calling this meeting was to make afew remarks relative to the laws and ordinancesand the building of the TempleThe reason I want to speak ofthe laws is that the officers have difficulties inadministering the laws. We are republican andwish to have the people rule but rule in righteousnessSome would complain with what God Himself woulddo. The laws are enacted by petition and theycan be repealed if they wish it but the peopleought not to complain of the officers but complainof the lawmakersI am instructed by the CityCouncil to tell this people that if you do not likeany law which we have passed we will repeal itfor we are your servants. If any complain ofour rights and charters it is because they are wickedThe Devil is in them.The reason I call this up iswe have a simple gang fellews who do notknow where their head or elbows are. If you preach 
 virtue to them they will oppose it. If you preach the MethodistGod to them they will oppose that also or anything else andif there is any case tried they want it appealed to CarthageMr Boswicks case had to go there. Our lawyers willsend anything to CarthageI want to know if the citizens willsustain me when my hands are raised to heaven for thepeople. I will arraign the person before the peoplewho acts against the interest of the city and I shall havethe voice of the people which is republican and is likelyto be the voice of GodAs long as I have a tongue to speakI will expose the iniquity of the lawyers and wickedmen. I fear not their boiling over nor the boiling overof Hell nor its thunders and forked lightning.I despise the man who will betray you with a kiss. Here is Hyrum Kimball. He hasset at naught the ordinances of the city by saying thathe owns the warf, and steamboats need not pay them.Wherefore? This body is the highest court. Whatappeal to Carthage? I would not appeal there if Idied a thousand deaths. Neither Kimball norMorrison owns the warfage. Water street runsalong the beach and belongs to the city and not individualsI will reprove the lawyers anddoctors. Jesus did and every prophet has and if I am a prophet I shall also do it. At any rateI shall do it for I profess to be a ProphetThe laws and Constitution of the United States have ceded the right to corporated cities to regulate all warfage of shiping and steamboats &cAll laws of taxation are subject to the city and not to individuals; and I want from this time forth 
 every fool to stay at home and let the steamboats andcaptains alone and let the peace officers alone. How canwe keep off mobs and keep inocent blood from beingshed? By striking a blow at everything whichrises up in disorder and I will wage an eternalwar with those who oppose me while I am labouringin behalf of the city.A man has been writing to the New York Tribune. I will not mention his nameHe says that much has been spent for otherpurposes which was appropriated for the building ofthe Temple; but I will pledge myself that anyman who has paid any old shoes harness oranything else if he will come I will show himon book that everything farth has been appropriated forthe building of the Temple.There are many men in ourmidst who are trying to build up themselves atour expence and others who are watching for iniquityand who will make a man an offender for aword. But I will give way and, rest myself forothers"President Hyrum Smith then madesome costick remarks upon the lawyersA brother of Dr Foster threatened theMayor and the Mayor fined him ten dollars.President Joseph Smith's views of theGovernment was then read and he was by universalapplause nominated by the Saints as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States. An article wasread entitled a "Voice of Inocence from Nauvoo" anda meeting of the "Female Relief Society appointed toattend to the issue of this article. 
 During the intermission which followed theTwelve met with the Seventies and they passed a resolutionto build the Hall of the Seventies one story higher for the Presidency.In the afternoon President Brigham Young addressedthe assembly. In the course of his remarks he said"I wish to speak of the duty of lawyers classingmyself with the lawyers in the House of Israel When any manwho is a lawyer takes a course to break peace instead of making it he is out of the way of his duty. A doctor of the lawshould study the law and make peaceThe grand object we have before us is to buildthe Temple this season. We have had the effects ofslander and want a cure and balm. I carry onewith me all the while and I want you to do the sameI will tell you what it is. It is to mind our ownbusiness and let others alone and suffer wrong ratherthan do wrong. If any one will take your propertyaway let him alone and have nothing to do withhimA spirit has been manifested to divide the Saints. This was manifest in the lastelection. It was said if they did not look outthe Saints on the flat would beat the Saints onthe hill. Great God! How such a thinglooks that the Saints should be affraid of beatingone another in the election or being beat?I would ask who built up thiscity? Would steamboats have landed here if the Saints had not come or could speculatorshave sold their lands for anything here? If theSaints had not come they might have sold for afew bear and wolf skins but not for money. Canthese speculators sell all their lands to the Saints 
 for a great price and then go away and enjoy it somewhereelse. I tell you nay for know it ye people that Israelis here and that they are the head and not the tail and thepeople must learn it. All those who have gone from ushave gone from the head to the tail. But if any of youwish to know how to have your bread fall butter side upthen butter it both sides and it will fall so. Upposethis work and it will roll over you. When did thiswork ever stop since it began? Never. The onlything the Saints now want to know is what does the Lord want of us and we are ready to do it. Wellthen build the Temple of the Lord; keep the law ofGod ye Saints and the hypocrit and scoundral will flee out of your midst and tremble for the fire of Godwill be too hot for them"Joseph the Prophet & the Presidential ChairElder John Taylor followed Brigham Young in an addressupon government and political matters and Joseph in anaddress after said"As to politics I care but little aboutthe Presidential Chair. I would not give half as much forthe office as I would for the one I now hold; but as theworld have used the power of government to oppress andpersecute us it is right for us to use it for the protectionof our rights. When I get hold of the eastern papersand I see how popular I am, I am affraid myself that I shallbe elected; but if I should be elected I would not say yourcause is just but I cannot do anything for you 
 What I said in relation to theAnexation of Texasis with some unpopular. The people are opposed to it.I will take this objection away. The opposition is because it is filled up with slavery. Now I wish to turn theargument. It is the very reason why they ought to bereceived in order to watch over them. Of the two evilswe should reject the greatest. The President of Texassays if you do not receive us in the United States wewill go to the British. This would certainly be badpolicy for this nation. The British are now throughoutthe whole country trying to bribe all they can. Howmuch better it is to be to a little expence than to havethe Indians and British upon us. We should graspall the Territory we can. I know much which Ido not tell. I have had bribes offered to me but I have rejected them. The government will not receiveanything from me. They are self-sufficient; but theymust go to Hell and work out their own salvationwith fear and trembling. As soon as Texasis anexed I would liberate two are three Statesand pay them for their slaves and let them goto Mexico where they are mixed blacks &c. I wouldalso receive Canadia and stand by it."Next day March the 8th I met incouncil with the Twelve and First Presidency when thesubject of nominating a candidate for the vice Presidency of the U.S. came up. They had nominatedGeneral Arlington Bennet not knowing that he wasa native of Ireland. The final decision was forme to write to Col. Solomon Copeland to invite himto visit us and see if he would suffer his name 
 to run for the Vice Presidency and I wrote to him accordinglyOn the seventh day of this month BroKing Follet was buried under Masonic honours. Hewas killed while in a well by having a bucket of stonefall on himA large Assembly of the Saints net atthe Temple and was addressed by Joseph uponThe Work Calling & Spirit of Elias Elijah & MessiahThere is a difference between the spirit andoffice of Elias and Elijah. It is the Spirit of Elias I wish first to speak off. And in order to come to the subject I will bring some of the testimony fromthe scripture and give also my own.In the first place suffice it to saythat I went into the woods to inquire of the Lord by prayerHis will concerning me and I saw an angel and helaid his hands upon my head and ordained me to be apriest after the order of Aaron and to hold the keys of thisPriesthood which office was to preach repentence and baptismfor the remission of sins and also to baptize. ButI was informed that this office did not extend to thelaying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost and thatthat office was a greater work and was to be given afterwardbut that my ordination at that time was a preparatorywork or a going before which was the spirit of Elias for the spirit of Elias was a going before to prepare the wayfor the greaterThis was the case with John the BaptistHe came crying from the wilderness "Prepare ye the theway of the Lord and make his paths straight and the people 
 were informed that if they would receive it it was the Spirit of Elias.John was very particular to tell the people he was not that lightbut was sent to bear witness thereof. He told them that hismission was to preach repentance and baptism with waterbut that it was he who should come after him who shouldbaptize with fire and the Holy Ghost. If he had been an imposter he might have worked beyond his bounds and undertook to have performed ordinances which did notbelong to the office and calling under the spirit of EliasThe spirit of Elias is to prepare the way for a greater revelation of God. This is the priesthood of Elias or the priesthood unto which Aaron was ordainedAnd when God sends a man into the world to preparefor a greater work he holds the keys of the power ofElias. It was called the doctrine of Elias evenfrom the early ages of the worldJohn's mission was limited to preachingand baptizing but what he did was legal and whenJesus Christ came to any of John's disciples he baptizedthem with fire and the Holy Ghost.We find the Apostles endowedwith greater power than John. Their office was moreunder the Spirit and power of Elijah than of EliasIn the case of Philip when he went down to Samariaunder the Spirit of Elias he baptised both men and women but when Peter and John heard of it they wentdown and laid their hands on them and they receivedthe Holy Ghost. This shows the distinction betweenthe two powers. When Paul came to certain discipleshe asked if they had received the Holy Ghost. Theyanswered, "No." Who baptized you then?""We were baptized unto John's baptism." "No Johndid not baptize your for he did his work right." 
 So Paul baptized them over again for he knew what the truedoctrine was and he knew that John had not baptized themand it is strange to me that men who have read the script[ures]of the New Testament are so far from these principlesWhat I want to impress upon yourmind is the difference of power in different parts of thePriesthood so that when any man comes among you sayingI have the Spirit of Elias you may know whether he betrue or false for any man coming having the spirit and power of Elias will not transcend his bounds. Johndid not transcend his bounds but faithfully performedthat part belonging to his office. And every portion ofthe great building should be prepared rightly and assigned to its proper placeIt is necessary to know who holdsthe keys of power and who do not or we may be likelyto be deceived. That person who holds the keys of Elias has a preparatory work. But if I spend much more time in conversing about the spirit ofElias I shall not have time to do justice to the spiritand power of Elijah who is the Elias spoken of in thelast days. And here is the rock upon which manysplit thinking the time was past in the days ofJesus Christ and no more to be; but the spirit of Elias was revealed to me and I know it is true thereforI speak with boldness for I know verily my doctrineis true.Now for Elijah. The spirit power and calling of Elijah is that we have power to hold the keys of the revelations ordinances oracles and endowme[nt]of the fulness of the Melchezedec Priesthood and ofthe kingdom of God on the earth and to receive andperform all the ordinances of the kingdom of God 
 even to the sealing of the hearts of the fathers unto the children andthe hearts of the children unto the fathers even those who are in heaven.Malachi says, "I will send Elijahbefore the great and dreadful day of the Lord come and Heshall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children and the heartsof the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite the earthwith a curseNow what I am after is the knowledgeof God and I take my own course to obtain it. Whatare we to understand by thisthe mission of Elijah in the last days. In thedays of Noah God destroyed the world by a flood andhe had promised to destroy it by fire in the lastdays. But before it takes place Elijah shall first come and turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children &cNow comes the point. What is the office and work of Elijah?  and this is one of the most important subjectsthat God has revealed.He shall send Elijah to seal thefathers to the children and the children to the fathers!Now was this merely confined to the living to settledifficulties with families on earth? By no means.It was a far greater work. Elijah, What would you do were you here? Would you confine your work to the living alone. No. I would refer youto the Scriptures where the subject is manifest."Without us they cannot be made perfect nor we without them". the fathers without the children nor the children without the fathers.I wish you to understand this subject for it is important and if you will receive it this is theSpirit of Elijah that we redeem our dead and connectourselves with our fathers who are in heaven and sealup our dead to come forth in the first resurrection 
 And here we want the power of Elijah to seal those whodwell on the earth to those who dwell in heaven. This isthe power of Elijah and the keys of the Kingdom of JehovahLet us suppose a case. Suppose thegreat God who dwells in the heavens should reveal himselfto Father Cutter here and tell him I offer up a decreethat whatsoever you seal on earth with your decree will Iseal in heaven. You have power then? Can it betaken off? No. Then what you seal on earth by the power of Elijah is sealed in heaven and this isthe power of Elijah and herein is the difference betweenthe power of Elias and Elijah for while the spirit ofElias is a forerunner the power of Elijah is sufficientto make our calling and election sure; and it isthe same doctrine where we are exhorted to go onunto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works but of laying on of handsthe resurrection of the dead &c. We cannot be perfectwithout the Fathers &c. We must have revelationthen and we can see that the doctrine of revelation asfar transcends the doctrine of no revelation at all asknowledge is above ignorance for one truth revalledfrom heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existanceThis spirit of Elijah was manifestin the days of the Apostles in delivering certain onesover to the buffettings of Satan that they may besaved in the day of the Lord Jesus. They weresealed by the spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of hell until the day of the Lord or revelation ofJesus Christ.Here is the doctrine of election thatthe world have quarrelled so much about but theydo not know anything concerning it. The doctrine 
 that the Prysbeterians and Methodists have quarreled so much aboutnamely once in grace always in grace and on the other side thefalling away from grace I will say a word about. They areboth wrong. Truth takes the road between. The Prysbeteriansays once in grace you cannot fall. The Methodist saysyou can have grace to day fall from it tomorrow nextday have grace again and so follow it on. But the doctrine of the Scriptures and the spirit of Elijah wouldshow them both false and take the road between.According to the Scriptures if a man has received the goodword of God and tasted of the powers of the world to comeif he shall fall away it is impossible to renew himagain seeing that he has crucified the Son of Godafresh and put him to an open shameSo there is a possibility of fallingaway yet could not be renewed again and the power of Elijah cannotseal against this sin for this is a reserve made in theseals and power of the Priesthood.I will make every doctrine plainthat I present and it shall stand upon a firm basisand I am at the defiance of the world for I will takeshelter under the broad cover of the wings of the workin which I am engaged. It matters not to me if all hell boils over. I regard it only as I would the cracklings ofthe thorns under the potA murderer for instance - onewho has shed inocent blood cannot have forgivenessDavid sought repentance at the hand of God carefullywith tears; but he could only get it through hell. Heobtained a promise that his soul should not be left in hell. Although David was king he never did obtain the spirit and power of Elijah and the fulness ofthe Priesthood and the priesthood that he received and 
 and the throne and kingdom of David are to be taken fromhim and given to another by the name of David inthe last days raised up out of his lineage.Peter refered to the same subjecton the day of Penticost but the multitude did not getthe endowment which Peter had; but several days afterthe people asked  "what shall we do?" Speaking of theircrucifying the Lord Peter said "I wot that through ignoranceye did it as did also your rulers" He did not say tothem repent and be baptized for the remission of your sinsbut he said "Repent ye therefore and be converted that yoursins may be blotted out when the times of refreshingshall come from the presence of the Lord." This is thecase with murderers. They could not be baptized for the remission of sins for they had shed inocent bloodAgain to the doctrine of the sealingpower of Elijah. If you have power to seal on earthand in heaven then you should be wise. The first thingyou do go and seal on earth your sons and daughters untoyourself and yourself unto your fathers in eternal gloryand go ahead and not go back. Use a little craftinessand seal all you can and and when you get to heaven tellyour father that what you sealed on earth should be sealed inheaven. I will walk through the gate of heaven andclaim what I seal and those that follow me and my counsel.The Lord once told me that what I askedfor I should have. I have been afraid to ask God tokill my enemies lest some of them should peradventurerepent. I asked a short time since for the Lord todeliver me out of the hands of the Governor of Missouriand if needs be to accomplish it to take him awayand the next news which came pouring down from 
 there was that Governor Reynolds had shot himselfI would now say Beware O Earth how youfight against the Saints and shed inocent blood for in the daysof Elijah when his enemies came upon him fire was called down fromheaven and destroyed themThe Spirit of Elias is first Elijah secondand Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the wayand the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after holding thekeys of power, building the Temple to the cap-stone, placingthe seals of the Melchezedec Priesthood upon the house ofIsrael and making all things ready. Then Messiahcomes to his Temple which is last of allMessiah is above the spirit and power of Elijah for he made the world and was that spiritualrock unto Moses in the wilderness. Elijah was to comeand prepare the way and build up the kingdom before the coming of the great day of the Lord though the spirit ofElias was to begin it.I have asked the Lord concerning hiscoming and while asking the Lord gave me a sign andsaid "In the days of Noah I set a bow in the heavens asa sign and token. In any year that the bow shall beseen the Lord will not come but there shall be sead timeand harvest during that year. But whenever you see thebow withdraw it shall be a token that there shall befamine pestilence and great distress among the nationsBut I will take the responsibility upon myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord that Christwill not come as Miller has prophesied for we have seenthe bow and I also prophesy in the name of the Lord thatChrist will not come in forty years and if ever the Lord spake by my mouth he will not come in that timeJesus never did reveal to any man the precise time 
 that he would come. Go and read the scriptures and youcannot find any part which specifies the exact time of hiscoming and all who say so are false teachers. There are some important things concerning the office of the Messiahin the organization of the kingdom of God of which I will speak hereafter."The Sunday fortnight when I arrived atthe Temple Joseph was speaking. He said"I have been informed by two gentlementhat a conspiracy is got up in this place for the purposeof taking the life of President Joseph Smith his familyand all the Smith family and also the heads of theChurch. One of the gentlemen will give his nameto the public and the other wishes it to be hid forthe present. They will both testify to it on oathand make an affadavit upon it. The names of the persons revealled at the head of the conspiracy are ChancyHigby Dr Foster Mr Jackson and William and Wilson LawAnd the lies which Highby has hatched up as a foundationis--he says that I had mens heads cut off in Missouriand that I had a sword run through the hearts of thepeople whom I wanted to kill and out of the way.I wont sware out a warrant againstthem for I do not fear any of them. They would not scare off an old setting hen. I intend to publish all the iniquitythat I know of them. If I am guilty I am ready tobear it. There is honour among enemies. I amwilling to do anything for the good of the people. Iwill give the name of one of the gentlemen who havedevulged the plot. His name is Eaton. He willsware to it. He is a bold fellow. Jackson said 
 a Smith should not be alive two weeks not over two months anyhowAs concerning the character of these men I will say nothing about itnow but if I hear any more from them upon this subject I will tellall I know about them"Orson Spencer and Sidney Rigdon followed withaddresses to the Assembly and then Joseph again arose andremarked upon a point of Sidney's discourse. He saidIn relation to the power of the mindsof mankind which I hold I would say it is in consequenceof the power in the doctrines which I have been an instru-ment in the hands of God of presenting unto them andnot because of any compu[l]sion on my part. I will askif I ever got any of it unfair? if I have not reproved you in the gate? I ask did I ever exercise compulsion overany man? Did I not give him the liberty of disbelievingany doctrine I preached if he saw fit? Why do notmy enemies strike a blow at my doctrine? Theycannot do it. It is truth; and I am as the voiceof one crying in the wilderness. "Repent of your sinsand prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Manfor the Kingdom of God has come unto you and hence forth the axe is laid unto the root of the treeand every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit GodAlmighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down and cast into the fire"Twelve days later I attended thededication of the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge. This wasthe first Masonic dedication I ever attended. The procession was composed of about five hundred membersand the whole was grand and imposingIn the forepart of the day PresidentJoseph Smith was to have preached the funeral sermon 
 of King Follet one of the Masonic Brotherhood but in consequenceof ill health he omitted it and called upon Elder Amasa Lymanto address the multitude who had assembled on purpose to hear the funeral discourse from Joseph.The day following this was the anniversaryof the Church which opened our anual General ConferenceGeneral Conferenceof theChurch of Jesus Christ of L.S.D [L.D.S.]held at NauvooApril 6th A.D. 1844.Conference commenced at 10 am. President Brigham Young called the Conference to order. The Prophetthen said that he should not occupy time in speakingof any differences which might have occurred in ourmidst He said he was not a Fallen Prophetand never sustained a nearer relationship to God thanat the present time and would show before theconference closed that God was with himSidney Rigdon afterwards spokeand during the Conference of the several days hedelivered three important discourses of which I reported asynopsis in my journal and which will be found embodiedin the History of Joseph SmithOn the 3rd Sunday of theSunday the 7th in the afternoon the Prophet Joseph delivered one of the most important discourses of hislife to about ten thousand souls upon the subject of the death of King Follet. 
 Joseph's Great Discourse(recorded in my Journal)I now call the attention of this congregationwhile I address you upon the subject of the dead.The case of our beloved brother KingFollet who was crushed to death in a well, as also manyothers who have lost friends will be had in mind this afternoonand I shall speak upon the subject in general as far as Ishall be inspired by the Holy Spirit to treat upon itI want the prayers and faith of the Saints that I might have the Holy Ghost so that thetestimony may carry conviction to your minds of thetruth of what I shall say and I pray that the Lordmay strengthen my lungs. There is strength here andyour prayers will be heard.Before I enter upon an investigation of this subject I wish to pave the way and bring upthe subject from the beginning that you may understandI do not intend to please you with oratory but with thesimple truths of heaven to edify you.Go to the morn of Creation to understandthe decrees of Eloheim at the creation. It is necessarythat we have an understanding of God at the beginningIf we get a good start at first we can go right but ifyou start wrong you may go wrongBut few understand the characterof God. They do not know Him they do not understand their relationship to Him. The world knowno more than the brute beast. They know no morethan to eat drink and sleep. This is all man knowsabout God or His existance except what is given by the inspiration 
 of the Almighty.Go then to the beginning that you mayunderstand. I ask this congregation what kind of abeing is God? Turn your thoughts in your ownhearts and say have any of you seen or heard Himor communed with Him. This is a question whichmay occupy your attention. The scriptures informs usthat this is eternal life to know thee the only true andliving God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. Ifany enquire What kind of a being God is I would sayif you do not know Him you have not eternal lifeGo back and find out what kind of a being God is.If I am the man that shows you what kind of being God is then let every man and woman sit in silenceand never lift up the hand against me again. If Ido not this I will make no more pretentions toinspiration or to be a Prophet. I should be like therest of the world a false teacher and you would wantto take my life. But you might just as welltake the lives of other false teachers as mine if Iwas false. But meddle not with any man for hisreligion. Every Government ought to protect every manto enjoy his religionI will show the world is wrong byshowing what God is. I am going to enquireafter Him so that you may know God that persecutionmay cease concerning me. I will go back to thebeginning to show what kind of a being God was. Iwill tell you and hear it O Earth! God who sits inYonder heavens is a man like unto yourselves.That God if you were to see Him to day who holdsthe worlds you would see Him like a man - in formlike yourselves. Adam was made in His 
 image and talked and walked with HimIn order to understand the dead for theconsolation of those who mourn I want you to understand God andhow he came to be God. We have supposed that God was God from eternity. I will refute that idea or I will take awaythe veil so that you may see. It is one of the first principlesto know that we may converse with Him. He was once aman like unto us and the Father was once on an earthlike us, and I wish I was in a suitable place to tell itThe scriptures inform us, mark it, thatJesus Christ said "As the Father hath power in Himself sohath the Son power in Himself." To do what? The Father did evento lay down my body and take it up again. Do you believeit? If not you do not believe the Bible. I will defy all hell andearth to refute this. And you have got to learn how to becomeyourself God king and priest by going from a small capacityto a great capacity, to the resurrection of the dead and todwelling in everlasting burning. I want you to learn thefirst principle of this orderHow consoling to the mourners whenthey part with their friends to know that though they lay downthis body it will rise and dwell in everlasting burningto be an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus Christenjoying the same exaltation and glory until you arrive atthe station of a GodWhat did Jesus Christ do? "Thesame as I see the Father do." See the Father do what?"Work out a kingdom. When I have done so too I willgive it up to the Father which will add to His gloryHe will then take a higher exaltation and I shall take His place and be also exalted"These are the first principles of the Gospel. It will take a long time after the 
 grave to understand the wholeIf I should say anything but what was inthe Bible the cry of treason would be heard. I will thengo to the Bible and will make a comment on the veryfirst sentence of the history of the Creation--Berosheit. I wantto analize the word; baith, in, by, through and everythingelse. Rosh, the head; sheit, gramatical terminationWhen the inspired man wrote it he did not put the baiththere; an old Jew without any authority added the word: hethought it too bad to begin to talk about the head. It reat[d] at first "The head one of the Gods brought forth the Gods: that isthe true meaning of the words. Baurau signifies tobring forth. If you do not believe it you do not believe the learned man of God. Learned men canteach you no more than what I have told you. Thus the head God brought forth the Gods in the grand councilI will transpose it in the English language. I want you toknow and learn that the Holy Ghost knows something.The Grand Council sat at the head and contemplated theCreation of the world. Some will say the scripturessay so and so; but I will show you a test out of an oldedition of the New Testament in the Hebrew LatinGerman and Greek languages. In the 21 verse of thefourth ch. of Mathew our common translation saysJames the Son of Zebedee but this old book in mypossession says Jacob the Son of Zebedee in each of thefour languages - the Hebrew Latin German and GreekThe doctors (I mean the doctors of the law) say if youpreach anything not according to the Bible we will crytreason; but if ye are not led by revelation How can ye escape the damnation of hell. Here we have the testimonyof four against one--the present translation. I have the oldestbook in the world and the Holy Ghost besides. I thank Godfor the old book but more for the Holy Ghost. 
 In the beginning the head of the Gods called a council ofthe Gods and they came together and concocted a plan to create the world and peopleit. Having a knowledge of God and what kind of a being he is we know how to approach him and how to ask so as to receive an answer.Another thing, the learned say the Lord made the world out of nothing and they accountedblasphemy in any one to contradict their idea. If you tell them God made theworld out of something they will account you a fool. But I am more learned in thethings of God than they and know more than all the world put together: the Holy Ghost doesanyhow and he is within me and comprehends more than all the world and I willassociate myself with him. They infer from the word create that the world musthave been made out of nothing. Now the word create came from the word Baurauand does not mean to create out of nothing but to organize the same as a man would organizematerials to build a ship. Element had an existance. from the time God had. It can be organizedand reorganized but not destroyed. I have another subject to speak upon calculated to exalt manIt is associated with the subject of the ressurection of the dead--namely, the soulthe mind of man, the immortal spirit, where did it comefrom? The learned say God made it in the beginningBut it is not so. I know better. God has told meIf you do not believe it that will not make the truthwithout effect. God was a self-existing being Manexists upon the same principle. God made a tabernacleand put the spirit into it and man became a humansoul. Man existed in spirit and mind co-equalwith God HimselfYou who mourn the loss of friendsare only seperated from them but for a moment.The spirit is seperated for a little time but they are conversant with each other as we are on earth. I amdwelling on the immutibility of the spirit of manIs it logic to say the spirit of man had a beginningand yet has no end? It does not have either abeginning or end. My ring is like the existanceof the soul of man. It has no beginning or end. Ifit were cut in two there would be both a beginningand an end. So with man. If he had a beginning he would also have an end.If I am right I might say God neverhad power to create the spirit of man. God Himselfcould not create himself. Intelligence is eternal 
 and it is self-existing. All mind is succeptible of improvementThe relationship we sustain with God places us in a situationto advance in knowledge. God has power to institute lawsto instructe the lesser intelligences that they may be exaltedwith Himself. This is good doctrine. It tastes goodI can taste the principles of eternal life. So can youThey are given to me by the revelations of Jesus Christand I know you believe it. All that which Godsees fit to reveal in relation to us makes known hiswill to our spirits precisely as though we had no bodiesat all and those revelations which will save our spirits willalso save our bodies: hence the awful responsibility which restsupon us in relation to our dead for all the spirits who have notobeyed the Gospel in the flesh must obey it in the spirit or bedamned. Would to God I had forty days and nights in whichto tell you all; I would let you know that I am not'a fallen prophet.'The greatest responsibility laid upon us in thislife is to seek after our dead. The Apostle says theywithout us cannot be made perfect for it is necessary thatthe sealing powers should be in our hands to seal our childrenand our dead for the fulness of the dispensation of times -a dispensation to meet the promises made by Jesus Christbefore the foundation of the world for the Salvation of manIt is necessary that those who are gone before and those who comeafter us should have salvation in common with us and thushas God made it obligatory upon man. Hence He has saidI will send Elijah the Prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the childrenFrom before the foundation of the world God hathmade provisions to suit the conditions of man. Jesus said, "Allsins and blasphemy except the sin against the Holy Ghost shouldbe forgiven and there is a salvation for all either in thisworld or the world to come who have not committed the unpardonable 
 sin. God has made provision that every spirit in the eternal world can besaved unless he has committed this sin and the spirits of our friendscan be searched out and saved. Any man who has a friend in eternitycan save him of he has not committed the unpardonable sin.A man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after thedissolution of the body and there is a possibility of his escape. If aman has knowledge he can be saved. If he has been guiltyof great sins he is punished for them. When he consents toobey the Gospel whether alive or dead he is saved.A man's own mind damns him. Ihave no fear of hell fire. It does not exist. The tormentof disapointment in the mind of man is as a lake burningwith fire and brimstone.No man can commit the unpardonablesin until he receives the Holy Ghost and then it must bedone in this world and cannot be committed after thedissolution of the body. Hence the salvation of Jesus Christ wrought for all men triumphs over the devilfor even he stood up as a Saviour. All who suffer untilthey obey Christ himself.The contention in heaven was--Jesus saidthere would be souls who would not be saved and the Devilsaid he could save them all and laid his plans before thegrand Council who gave their vote in favour of Jesus Christso the devil rose up in rebellion against God and was castdown with all who put up their hands for him.Jesus Christ will save all except the sons of Perdition. What must a man do to commit the unpardonable sin. He must receive the Holy Ghost havethe heavens opened to him and know God and then sinagainst Him. After a man has sinned against theHoly Ghost there is no repentance for him. He has got tosay the sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to 
 to deny Jesus Christ when the heavens have been opened to him andto deny the plan of salvation with his eyes open to the truth and from that time he begins to be an enemy. This is the case with many apostatesof the Church. They never cease to try to hurt me and thirst for myblood; they have the spirit of the devil which crucified the Lord ofLife - the same that sins against the Holy Ghost. You cannotsave them. They make open war like the Devil.If a spirit of bitterness is in you dont be in haste. You may say that man is a sinner. Well if he repents he shall be forgiven. Becautious. When you find a spirit that wants murder the sameis of the devil.I could go back and trace every subject of interest concerning therelationship of man to God if I had time and enter largely into theeternal worlds. Jesus says there are many mansions in my FathersKingdom and Paul says there is one glory of the sun another of the Moonanother of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glorySo also is the resurrection of the dead. What have we to console us inrelation to our dead? The greatest hope of any people on earth. We have seen them walk worthily in our midst and sink asteep inthe arms of Jesus and those who have died in the faith are nowin the celestial kingdom of God. They have gone to await the resurrectionof the dead to go into celestial glory while there are many who willhave to wait myrids of years before they can receive the likeblessings. I am authorized to say to you by the authority of the Holy Ghost that you have no occasion to fear. You may wait foryour friends to meet you in the morn of the celestial world.Those who have been murdered in the persecution shall triumph gloriousin the celestial world while their murdersers shall dwell in torment forages until they have paid the uttermost farthingI have a father brothers chrildren and friends who gone to a world of spirits. They are only absent for a moment, and we shall soon meetagain. The time will soon arrive when the trumphet shall sound. When wedepart we shall hail our mothers, fathers, friends and all whom we love whohave fallen asleep in Jesus. There will be no fear of mobs &c. It will be aneternity of felicity.A question may be asked will mothers have theirchildren in eternity. Yes yes mothers. You shall have your children 
 for they shall have eternal life; for their debt is paid. There is no damnation awaitingthem. They are in the Spirit. But as the child dies so shall it rise from the dead andbe forever living in the learning of God. It will never grow. It will still be the childin the same precise form as it appeared before it died out ofits mothersarms but possessing all the intelligence of a God. Children dwell in the mansions ofglory and exercise power but appear in the same form as when on earth. Eternityis full of thrones upon which dwell thousands of children reigning on thrones ofglory with not one cubit added to their stature.I will leave this subject here and make a few remarksupon the subject of baptism. The baptism of water without the baptism offire and the Holy Ghost is of no use. They are inseperably connected. Anindividual must be born of water and the spirit in order to enter the kingdomof God. In German the test bears me out the same as the revelations whichI have given and taught for the last fourteen years on that subject. Youwill find it in the declaration of John the Baptist. (reads from the German)John says "I baptize you with water but when Jesus comes who has thepower (or keys) he shall administer the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost"There is one God one Father one Jesus one hope of our calling onebaptism. All these three baptisms only make one. Many talk of baptismnot being essential to salvation; but this kind of teaching would lay thefoundation of their damnation. I have the truth and am at thedefiance of the world to contradict me if they canHear it all ye ends of the earth - all ye priests - all ye sinnersand all men, - Repent, repent! obey the Gospel; turn to God for yourreligion wont save you, and you will be damned: I do not say how long.There have been remarks made concerning all men being redeemed from hellbut I say that those who sin against the Holy Ghost cannot be forgivenin this world or the world to come. They shall die the second death. Those who commit the unpardonable sin are doomed to Gnolom to dwell inhell worlds without end. As they concoct scenes of bloodshed in this world sothey shall rise to that resurrection which is as the lake of fire and brimstoneSome shall rise to the everlasting burning of God, for God dwells in everlastingburnings and some shall rise to the damnation of their own filthinesswhich is as exquisite a torment as the lake of fire and brimstoneI have no enmity against any man. I love you all butI hate some of your deeds. I am your best friend and if persons misstheir mark it is their own fault. If I reprove a man and he hates mehe is a fool for I love all men especially these my brethren and sistersI rejoice to hear the testimony of some of my agedfriends. You dont know me. You never knew my heart. Noman knows my history. I cannot tell it. I shall neverundertake it. I dont blame anyone for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have I could nothave believed it myself. I never did harm any man sinceI was born into the world. My voice is always for peace.I cannot lie down until all my work is finished.I never think any evil nor do anything to the harm of my fellowman. When I am called by the trumph of the archangeland weighed in the balance you will all know me then.I add no more God bless you all. Amen 
 Conference reassembled the next day April the 8thwhen Joseph arose and said it was impossible for him tocontinue the subject of the previous day in consequence of theweakness of his lungs. But among his brief remarks wasone of the most important revelations of the age. He saidYet I haveA Great ProclamationIt is in relation to Zion and a proclamation for theElders to teach the Church hereafter. The whole of South & North America is Zion and the mountain of theLord's house is in the centre of North and South AmericaWhen the House is done the baptismal font erectedand finished and the worthy are washed anointed endowed &ordained kings and priests which must be done in this life -and when the place is prepared you must also go throughall the ordinances of the house of the Lord and ifyou have any dead relations for them also the sameas for yourselves - then the Elders are to go through allAmerica and build up Churches until all Zion is builtup. But this is not to commence until this Temple is built and the Elders are endowed. Then go forthand accomplish the work and build up stakes inall North and South America. There will be someplace ordained for the redeeming of the dead. I thinkthis will be the one.He also remarked that this proclamationwas the greatest ever made to us as all could notcome here but it was necessary that enough shouldcome to build up the Temple and get an endowment sothat the work could spread abroadJoseph's lungs failed him and he calledupon George G. Adams to occupy the forenoon 
 At the close of the morning's meeting President JosephSmith turned over the Conference into the hands of the Twelveand it continued through the next day under the presidencyof Brigham Young and then adjourned to the followingSaturday to re-assemble at 2 o clock to hear a politicaladdress from Elder John Taylor.During this ConferenceElders volunteered to go into the vineyard that season to preach the GospelOn the 4th of May I moved into mynew brick house and felt truly thankful to have acomfortable dwelling for the first time to have myfamily in while I went out again on mission.Next day I spent with my familypreparing for my Summer's mission and I calledmy family together and blessed them and Phebe washedmy feet that I might be clean every whitA number of Apostates on the same day  which was Sunday the 5th met together and organizeda new Church and took a strong stand againstthe Prophet the Twelve and the Church. The leaderswere Wm. [William] and Wilson Law R.D. Foster Chauncyand Francis Highby James Blakesley and others.Five days later which was Maythe 9th I arose in the morning arranged some domesticaffairs and parted from my wife and children for thepurpose of taking my summers mission through theUnited States to attend the General ConferencesFor the last ten years of my life with the exception ofone it had been my lot to be in the vineyard everysummer. I left Nauvoo in company withElders George A Smith J. M. Grant and Ezra Thayer 
 and his son.This was the last mission ever Josephthe Prophet gave to the Twelve Apostles of this dispensationHe wished none of us to remain with the exception of WillardRichards. He told John Taylor he wanted him togo especially on this mission with his quorum and hespoke with much earnestness. He also turned to meand said brother Woodruff I want you to go and ifyou do not you will die. It rested with weight upon my mind at the time he spoke and I have often thoughtsince when musing over the awful catastrophy of his & Hyrumsmartyrdom how true his words might have been had Iremained. Elder Taylor did remain and he and WillardRichards the only ones of the Twelve left in Nauvoo wherewith him in prison at his assassination. Had moreof us been there with him in Nauvoo we might someof us have met the death which Elder John Taylorbut barely escaped. having receivedIt might have been that Willard Richards who was theonly one whom Joseph wished to stay with him of theTwelve was also the only one of us who could stay withhim safely unhurt and he passed through that awful scene of the martyrdom of our Prophet and Patriarch safefrom personal harm.I took the parting hand of Josephand Hyrum at their own dwelling. Joseph wasstanding in his own entery when I took his hand tobid him farewell. Brother J. M. Grant was withme. As he took me by the hand he said"Brother Woodruff, you are now about to start uponyour mission" I answered "Yes" He lookedme steadily in the eye for a time without speakingHe looked as though he would penetrate my very 
 soul but at the same time seemed unspeakably sorrowful asthough he was weighed down with a foreboding of somethingdreadful in the future. He finally spoke in a mournfulvoice - "God bless you Brother Woodruff! Go in peace!"I turned and left him with a sorrowful heart partakingof the same spirit that rested upon him. This was the last time I ever saw his face or heard his voice again.During the following week we journeyedon our mission held meetings and on the 18th in NewarkKendall Co George A Smith and myself of the Twelveheld our first conference at which were present various other officers of the Church. At the close of the ConferenceElders Charles C. Rich David Fulmer and Henry Jacobsarrived from NauvooNext evening we all met at the schoolHouse to deliver a political lecture. I called the meetingto order and introduced to the assembly Mr Henry Jacobswho arose and read General J Smiths views of the policyand powers of the United States Government afterwhich I introduced Mr David Fulmer who addressed theassembly in an effective manner showing the policyof Joseph and then I urged our claims and right to votefor our own president and George A Smith closed witha spirited political address. The next evening wealso held another meeting for the same object and had quite a time in political spirit and the impression made on the people was good. We had rode on thisday thirty miles to hold our meeting in a large schoolroom in JuliettWe continued from place to placeholding meetings reading the views of General Joseph Smith to public assemblies making political speechesand placing Joseph before the public as a fitting 
 candidate for the Presidency of the United StatesOn the 1st of June we held the KalamazooConference in Comstock Kalamazoo Co. Michigan. Therewere present 2 of the quorum of the Twelve--WilfordWoodruff and George A Smith; 3 High Priests--S. BentCharles C. Rich and D.

Coltrin and also 8 of the Seventies, 14 Elders2 Priests and 1 Deacon.The conference was called to order byElder Charles C. Rich when Elder Wilford Woodruffwas chosen to the chair and Elders C. Dunn andE M Webb as clerks of the Conference.The various Branches were represented& President C. C.

We spent the forepart of the day togetherEarly in the evening he took cars forSalem. This was onThe Day of the MartyrdomElder Brigham Young and myself were setting together inthe railway station at the time that Joseph and his brother 
 Hyrum were assassinated. This was June the 27th at a quarter past five at Carthage the place of the fiendish tragedy and halfpast six p.m.at Boston where Elder Young and myself were. Brigham as wesat together in the Station was very sorrowful and depressed in spiritwithout knowing the cause. This was the time that the direst blowwhich Satan had struck since the Son of God was crucified sent thespirits of the Prophet and Patriarch to join the martyred host of God's servantsToo well we afterwards knew why all the Twelve wherever they wereon that day and at that time were like the President of our quorumvery sorrowful and burdened in spirit without knowing why.Two days afterwards we held theBoston Conferenceof theChurch of Jesus Latter Day Saintsat Franklin HallJune 29, 1844There was present a majority of the quorum of the Twelve- namely, Brigham Young its President HeberC. Kimball Orson Hyde Orson Pratt William SmithLyman Wight and Wilford Woodruff; and also alarge number of Elders. Brigham Youngpresided.The Conference continued for two daysand was addressed by Orson Hyde Brigham YoungH. C. Kimball Lyman Wight Orson Pratt andWilford WoodruffThe Conference was well attendedthe meeting spirity and the discourses instructiveand effectual. 
 State Convention of Jeffersonian Democracy.Ticket: General Joseph Smith for the Presidential ChairSidney Rigdon Vice PresidentThe convention met at 10 o clock a.m. July 1stin the Milodian [Melodeon] at Boston, and was organized asfollowsThe Hon Brigham Young of Nauvoo PresidentThe Hons William Smith and Gen Lyman Wightvice PresidentsThe Hon Wilford Woodruff and Professor O Prattof Illinois A Mc Allister Esq of Bostonand N H Felt Esq of Salem secretaries.The convention was addressed with muchanimation and patriotism during the day and evening by the President Hons Orson Hyde Daniel Spencer WilliamSmith and Proffessor Pratt all of Illinois and George BWallace of BostonA preamble and many importantresolutions were adopted all of which together with the proceedings of the meeting were published in the BostonTimes of July 2nd 1844.The Melodian was crowded inthe evening and it was soon evident that a large numberof rowdies were in the galleries and disposed to makedisturbance. Among others Abby Folsom made her appearance and arose and commenced speaking whilethe President of the convention was addressing the 
 meeting. A young man soon afterwards arose and began rowdy conductin which he was encouraged by his companions until confusion becamegeneral in the gallery. The police came in to take theyoung man out but they were badly beaten by a set of young desperadoes. After much hard fighting however theofficers succeeded in clearing the gallery of the rowdies but themeeting was also soon broken upThe convention was adjourned until the nextday at 4 o'clock at Bunker Hill. Heber C. Kimballand George B Walace were appointed delegates to the Baltimorenational convention.We met at 8 o clock a.m. on the 2nd ofJuly held a council and devided ourselves off into differentparts of the vineyard and each one took several conferencesto attend toThe same night I left the city incompany with Milton Holmes and old companionand fellow labourer in the ministry whom I had not met for five years. We left Boston at 7 o clock p.m.Next day we arrived at FatherCarter's early in the afternoon and found my wifes father and mother and her brother Fabyan and familyall well.I descovered on my arrival that brotherS. B. Stoddard and had given out an appointmentfor our conference which was held in Scarboro onthe 6th and 7th in a Presbyterian Meeting House.There were present of the EldersWilford Woodruff S. B. Stoddard Milton HolmesElbridge Tufts and Samuel Parker. On theSunday afternoon we had an audience of about sixhundred. 
 In company of Father Carter and Milton HolmesI left Scarboro on the 9th and rode to Portland and dinedwith my brother-in-law Ezra Carter and was about to takesteam boat in the evening for Thomastown and Fox Islandsbut in the afternoon we obtained the Boston Timescontaining the solemn information of the assassination of theProphet Joseph and his brother HyrumNext day I took the cars for Bostonand on the following met with the Saints. They mournedthe loss of the Prophet and Patriarch yet through our meetingthey were strengthened in the faith and the comfort of theSpirit was with us so that we had a good time togetherOn the morrow I wrote a letterto the Editor of the Prophet published in New Yorkby the friends of our martyred leader giving a wordof exhortation to the Saints abroad to maintain theirintegrity and keep the faith and paitence of thesaints unto deathThe following morning we obtainedinformation from Quincy as late as June 29th givingfull accounts of the horrid affair at Carthage and thetremendious loss which the Church had sustained.The Governor himself acknowledged the death of Josephand Hyrum to be a wanton murder. The State ofIllinois was in commotion and Governor Ford hadmade Quincy his head quarters and issued a proclamationto the citizens of the state. The news of the daystated that the Mormon Leaders in Nauvoo had doneall they could to restrain the disciples of the martyredProphet from vengeance still there was evidently adisposition of both the people and the troops to destroyNauvoo lest the Mormons should hold a fearfulreckoning in the state in their desperation and despair 
 at the loss and assassination of the Prophet and Patriarch of the ChurchThe wicked fleeth when no man pursueth.I again held meeting with the Boston Saintson Sunday the 14th preached to them in the forenoon ^from Rev Ch VI verse 9, 10, 11, & 12;^ administered the sacrament in the afternoon and preached again in the eveningI was the only one of the Twelve at that time in Boston.We had not heard from any of our brethrenof the calamity which had fallen upon us in the great berevementof the Church but as I arose on the morning of the 16th twoletters were handed to me one from Erastus Snow and the otherfrom John E. Page confirming the martyrdom of the Prophet and Patriarch.I immediately wrote three letters to Brigham Young and sent one to Peterboro N. H. one to Lowelland one to Bradford Mass. I then went direct to thepost office and took out a letter directed to G. A. Smith fromhis wife in which Mrs Woodruff wrote a few lines to mewhich was the first intelligence I had from her since I left home. She related to me a dream which Joseph hada few days before he sealed his testimony with his bloodHe thought that William and WilsonLaw bound him and cast him into a pit or welllike as Joseph was anciently. He struggled hardand got up so that he could look out and he sawthe Laws a little distance off one of them in thegrasp of a tigar and the other in that of a snakeThey called to Him to come and help them but he told themthey had bound him and he could not; and he thoughtin his dream that a brother soon came along and tookhim out of the pit.On the following day July 17thElder Brigham Young arrived in Boston. I walked with him to 57 Temple Street and called upon 
 Sister Vose. Brother Young took the bed and I the arm chair and here we veiled our faces and gave vent to ourgrief. Until now I had not shed a tear since I heardof the death of the Prophet but my soul had felt nervedup like steel. After giving vent to our grief in tearswe felt more composed. Brother Brigham left thecity again on the same dayOn the following day Elders Orson HydeHeber C. Kimball and Orson Pratt arrived in the cityand President Brigham Young also returned and we mettogether and held a council. I wrote a letter to the Prophet advising the Elders who haved families inNauvoo to go immediately to them and for all theauthorities of the Church to forthwith assemble atNauvoo for a Council: "By order of the Quorum ofthe Twelve. Wilford Woodruff clerk; Brigham YoungPresident. (Published in Deseret News Vol VII. No 44)That night there was a meeting in a hall in Washington Street opposite Boydston Hall.Elder Orson Hyde had advertized to preach on the murderof Joseph and Hyrum Smith at the close of which acollection was to be taken up to pay his expenceshome. I reported a synopsis of his address andrecorded it in my journal.At the close of Elder Hyde's discoursePresident Brigham Young arose and said he felt disposedto add his testimony"Be of good cheer. The testimony isnot in force while the Testator liveth: when he diedit was in force: so it is with Joseph. On the dayof Pentecost there were but one hundred and twenty ofthe Saints but at that time there was added threethousand souls. When God sends a man to do a 
 work all the devils in hell cannot kill him until he gets throughhis work: So with Joseph. He prepared all things gave the keysto men on the earth and said I may soon be taken from you."I left Boston on the 20th and arrived at myfather's house in Farmington two days later. I found my fatherand stepmother alone, not a child with them in their decline oflife to watch over themI had but twenty four hours to stayand I happily improved the time. My father was 67 yearsof age and I might never have seen him again in mortalityand my mind had been deeply impressed of late that Ihad something to do for my parents.As the sable shades of a serene nightdrew her curtain over the earth and stilled the cares of daywe met alone: none but congenial spirits were there. Iarose and with the spirit like that of Joseph towards hisfather Jacob opened my heart to my father and he reciprocatedmy sentiments. I then laid my hands upon his head andaccording to the authority of the Priesthood and Apostleship(confered upon me under the hands of the Twelve Apostlesupon the corner stone of the house of the Lord in Far WestPresident Brigham Young being mouth) I ordained myfather Aphek Woodruff unto the office of an Highpriest and Patriarch after the order of Melchezedic andI placed upon his head the seals of the covenant in connectionwith Bulah Thompson and Azubah Hart -- my own mother and stepmother and sealed him up unto eternallife. I shall never forget the deep satisfaction and heavenly spirit of that night beneath my father's roofSleep departed from me and I was wrapt in themeditations and visions of by gone days and the daysto come and of this life and the one hereafter. 
 The next day I again left my father's houseand arrived in New York on the next  [inserted in pencil] following [changes back to ink] morning. I thentook steamboat and found on board Elders Orson Hyde and Orson PrattWe were bound for Albany at which place when we arrivedwe took the rail for Buffaloo and on the way at Schenectadywe joined Elders B. Young H. C. Kimball and Lyman Wightmaking six of our quorum journeying homewards togetherWe reached Buffaloo on the 25 and nextmorning took steam boat and in 24 hours reached Clevelandbut Orson Hyde left us at Fairport to visit his family inKirtlandArriving at Detroit we spent the night of the27th at the railroad hotel and the next morning took steamboatpropeller Hercules for Chicago.This was Sunday. I spent a part of the day in writing. We had good state rooms and wascomfortable. We spoke much of our families and the deathof Joseph and Hyrum, and we felt anxious to get homePresident Young expressed his feelings tome upon a variety of subjects and among other things he saidhe wished me to keep an account of things as he shouldlook to me for his journal some day. I had aninteresting time with Lyman Wight talking over old timesand looking forward to new onesJoseph's Presentment that he would not see the Age of Forty.During our conversation Lyman Whight informed methat Joseph told him while they were in gaol [jail] together [changes to pencil] in [changes back to ink] that heMissouri that he should not live to see his fortieth yearof age but bid him not to reveal it until he was dead.Two nights before our arrival in NauvooElder Kimball had a dream which he related to us. He 
 thought he was preaching to a large congregation upon the policy of the nationand of the work of God, and he said Joseph had laid the foundation and weshould have to carry out his measures. Joseph was himself present and heard alland sanctioned it. All seemed perfectly naturalWe stoped at various places going down the Mississippi:among others the town of Burlington. We then prepared ourminds to once more behold the City of Nauvoo and embraceour families and friendsAugust the 6th We were landed at the upper stonehouse at 8 in the evening and were welcomed with joyby all the citizens we met. We hired a coach and Iaccompanied my brethren to their families after which Iwas conveyed to my own and truly felt to rejoice to oncemore meet with my wife children and friendsWhen we landed in the city of Nauvooa deep gloom seemed to rest over it which we never experiencedbefore. This was August the 6thThe next morning I went through thecity of Nauvoo saw many friends and net in council withthe quorum of the Twelve at Elder Taylor's whom we foundrecovering from his wounds received at the massacre of theProphet and Patriarch of the ChurchWe felt to rejoice at again having the privilege of meeting together in council in Nauvooafter passing through such trying scenes and to be welcomedby the Saints who considered it providential for the Twelveto arrive at this particular juncture when their minds wereagitated their hearts sorrowfull and darkness seemed tocloud their path feeling like a sheep without a shepherd theirbeloved Prophet having been taken awayWe spent the forepart of the day incouncil at brother Taylors and in the afternoon at 4 o'clockthe Twelve the High Council and the High Priests metat the Seventies Hall 
 After prayer by W[illia]m Marks President of the stake President Brigham Young called upon President Rigdonto make a statement to the Church concerning his message tothe Saints and the vision and revelation he had receivedPresident Rigdon said, The object of my missionis to visit the saints and offer myself to them as a GuardianI had a vision at Pittsburg June the 27th. This was presentedto my mind not as an open vision but rather a continuationof the vision mentioned in the Book of Doctrine and CovenantsIt was shown to me that this Church mustbe built up to Joseph and that all the blessings we receivemust come through him. I have been ordained a Spokesmanto Joseph and I must come to Nauvoo and see that theChurch is goverened in a proper manner. Joseph sustained thesame relationship to this Church as he has always done. Noman can be the succcessor of JosephThe kingdom is to be built up to Jesus Christthrough Joseph. There must be revelation still. Themartyred Prophet is still the head of this Church. Every quorum should stand as you stood in your washings and consecrationsI have been consecrated a spokesman to Joseph and Iwas commended to speak for him. The Church is not disorganizedthough our head is goneWe may have a diversity of feelingson this matter. I have been called to be a spokesman untoJoseph and I want to build up the Church unto him andif the people want me to sustain this place I want it uponthe principle that every individual shall acknowledge it forhimself.I propose to be a Guardian to the peopleIn this I have discharged my duty and done what God hascommanded me and the people can please themselveswhether they accept me or not" 
 President Brigham Young said, "I do not care wholeads the Church even though it were Ann Lee; but one thingI must know and that is what God says about it. I have the Keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God onthe subjectI know there are those in our midst whowill seek the lives of the Twelve as they did the lives of Josephand Hyrum. We shall ordain others and give the fulnessof the Priesthood so that if we are killed the fulness of the priesthood may remain.Joseph confered upon our heads all thekeys and powers belonging to the Apostleship which hehimself held before he was taken away and no man orset of men can get between Joseph and the Twelve inthis world or in the world to comeHow often has Joseph said to the TwelveI have laid the foundation and you must build thereonfor upon your shoulders the kingdom restsThe Twelve as a quorum will not bepermitted to tarry here long. They will go abroad andbear off the kingdom to the nations of the earth and baptizethe people faster than mobs can kill them off. I wouldlike were it my privilege to take my valise and travel andpreach until we had a people gathered who would be trueMy private feelings would be to let the affairs of men and women alone & only go and preachand baptize them into the kingdom of God; yet whateverduty God places upon me in His strength I intend to fulfillit.I want to see this people with the various quorumsof the Priesthood assemble together in Special Conferenceon Tuesday next at 10 oclock a.m." (which was carriedunanimously by vote) 
 At the request of William Marks who wasthen Presiding over the Stake a special meeting was held nextmorning at 10 o'clock to choose a Guardian or President andTrustee. Sidney Rigdon took his position in a waggonabout two rods in front of the stand and harangued theSaints for about an hour and a half upon chosing aGuardian for the Church. The meeting was then dismissedwhen President Brigham Young gave out an appointmentfor the brethren to assemble at 2 o'clockAt the appointed time the brethrencame together. Present of the Twelve -- Brigham YoungHeber C. Kimball Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt WillardRichards Wilford Woodruff and George A SmithThe several quorums were organized on and around the stand according to order.The meeting being opened PresidentBrigham Young arose and said, Attention all!This congregation makes me think of the days of king Benjamin the multitude being so great that all couldnot hear. I request the brethren not to have any feelingsfor being convened this afternoon for it is necessary. Wewant you all to be still and give attention that all mayhear. Let none complain because of the situation ofthe congregation. We will do the best we canFor the first time in my life, -- for thefirst time in your lives, for the first time in thekingdom of God in the nineteenth century without aprophet at our head do I step forth to act in my callingin connection with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostlesof Jesus Christ unto this generation--Apostles whomGod has called by revelation through the Prophet Josephwho are ordained and anointed to bear off the keys of the kingdom of God in all the world. 
 This people have hitherto walked by sight and not byfaith. You have had the prophet in your midst. Do you allunderstand? You have walked by sight and without muchpleading to the Lord to know whether things were right or not.Heretofore you have had a prophet as the mouth of the Lord tospeak to you, but he has sealed his testimony with his blood;and now for the first time are you called to walk by faith andnot by sight.The first position I take in behalf of the Twelve and the people is to ask a few questions. I ask the Latter-day Saints, do you as individuals at this time want tochoose a prophet or a guardian? Inasmuch as our Prophet and Patriarch are taken from our midst do you wantsome one to guard to guide and lead you through thisworld into the kingdom of God or not? All that wantsome person to be a guardian or a prophet a spokesmanor something else signify it by raising the right hand[text enclosed in box] No votes [end text box]When I came to this stand I had peculiarfeelings and impressions. The faces of this peopleseemed to say we want a shepherd to guide and lead usthrough this world. All who want to draw awaya party from the Church after them let them do itif they can but they will not prosperIf any man thinks he has influence amongthis people to lead away a party let him try it and hewill find out that there is power with the Apostles which will carry them off victorious through all the world andbuild up and defend the Church and kingdom of GodWhat do the people want? I feel asthough I wanted the privilege to weep and mourn forthirty days at least, then rise up shake myselfand tell the people what the Lord wants of them 
 Although my heart is too full of mourning to launch forth intobusiness transactions and the organization of the Church I feel compelled this day to step forth in the discharge of those dutiesGod has placed upon meI now wish to speak of the organizationof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If theChurch is organized and you want to know how it is organized I will tell you. I know your feelings. Do you want me to tell your feelings?Here is President Rigdon who was Counselorto Joseph. I ask, where are Joseph and Hyrum?They are gone beyond the veil and if Elder Rigdon wantsto act as his counselor he must go beyond theveil where he isThere has been much said about PresidentRigdon being President of the Church and leading thepeople, -- being the head &c &c. Brother Rigdon hascome 1600 miles to tell you what he wants to do foryou. If the people want President Rigdon to lead themthey may have him; but I say unto you that thequorum of the Twelve have the keys of the kingdomin all the worldThe Twelve are appointed by the finger of God. Here is Brigham; have his knees ever faltered?Have his lips ever quivered? Here is Heber and the rest of the Twelve an independant body who have thekeys of the priesthood -- the keys of the kingdom ofGod to deliver to all the world: this is true, so helpme God! They stand next to Joseph and are as the First Presidency of the ChurchI do not know whether my enemies will take my life or not and I do not care for I want to bewith the man I love. 
 You cannot fill the office of a Prophet Seer andRevelator: God must do this. You are like children withouta father and sheep without a shepherd. You must not appointany man at your head; if you should the Twelve must ordainhim. You cannot appoint a man at your head but if youdo want any other man or men to lead you take them andwe will go our way to build up the kingdom of God in allthe worldI know who are Josephs friends and who arehis enemies. I know where the keys of the kingdom areand where they will eternally be. You cannot call a manto be a Prophet; you cannot take Elder Rigdon and place him above the Twelve; if so he must be ordained by themI tell you there is an over anxiety to hurrymatters here. You cannot take any man and put himat the head; You would scatter the Saints to the four winds; You would sever the Priesthood. So long as weremain as we are the heavenly head is in constant co-operationwith us; and if you go out of that course God will havenothing to do with youAgain some perhaps think that our beloved brother Rigdon would not be honoured-- would notbe looked to as a friend; but if he does right and remainsfaithful he will not act against our counsel nor we againsthis but act together and we shall be as oneI again repeat, no man can standat our head except God reveals it from the heavens. I havespared no pains to learn any lesson of the kingdom inthis world and in the eternal worlds and if it were not soI could go and live in peace; but for the gospel and yoursakes I shall stand in my place. We are liable to bekilled all the day long. You have never lived by faith.Brother Joseph the Prophet has laid 
 the foundation for a great work and we will build upon it: you have neverseen the quroums built one upon another. There is an almightly foundationlaid and we can build a kingdom such as there never was in theworld: we can build a kingdom faster that Satan can kill theSaints off.What do you want? Do you want a Patriarch forthe whole Church? To this we are perfectly willing.  If brotherSamuel H Smith had been living it would have been hisright and privilege; but he is dead. He is gone to Joseph andHyrum; he is out of the reach of bullets and spears and hecan waft himself with his brothers his friends and the SaintsDo you want a Patriarch? Here is brother Williamleft; here is uncle John Smith, uncle to the Prophet Joseph leftIt is their right. The right of the Patriarchal Priesthood belongsto Joseph's family.Do you want a Trustee in Trust? Has therebeen a Bishop who has stood in his lot yet? What is hisbusiness? To take charge of the temporal affairs so thatthe Twelve and the Elders may go on their business. Josephcondescended to do their business for them. Josephcondescended to offer himself for the Presidency of the UnitedStates and it was a great condescension.Do you want a spokesman? Hereare Elder Rigdon brother Amasa Lyman (whom Josephexpected to take as a counsellor) and myself. Do you wantthe Church properly organized or do you want a spokesmanto be chief cook and bottle washer. Elder Rigdon claims to bespokesman to the Prophet. Very well, he was; but canhe now act in that office? If he wants now to be aspokesman to the Prophet he must go to the other side of the veil for the Prophet is there but Elder Rigdon is here. Whywill Elder Rigdon be a fool? Who knows anything of the Priesthoodor of the organization of the kingdom of God? I am plain. 
 Does the Church want it as God organized it? or do you want toclip the power of the Priesthood and let those who have the keys goand build up the kingdom in all the world wherever the people willhear them?If there is a spokesman, if he is king and priest lethim go and build up a kingdom unto himself. That is his right. Itis the right of many here; but the Twelve are at the head of it.I want to live on the earth and spread truth throughall the world. You Saints of Latter-days want things right. Iften thousand rise up and say they have the Prophet Joseph Smith'sshoes I know they are impostors. In the Priesthood you havea right to build up a kingdom if you know how the Churchis organized.Now if you want Sidney Rigdon or William Lawto lead you or anybody else you are welcome to them; but Itell you in the name of the Lord that no man can putanother between the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph. Why?Because Joseph was their file leader and he has committedinto their hands the keys of the kingdom in this last dispensation for all the world. Don't put a threadbetween the Priesthood of GodI ask who has stood next to Joseph and Hyrum?I have; and I will stand next to him. We have a headand that head is the Apostleship, the spirit and power of Joseph and we now can begin to see the necessity of thatApostleship.Brother Rigdon was at his side--not above.No man has a right to counsel the Twelve but Joseph SmithThink of these sayings things. You cannot appoint a Prophet but if you let the Twelve remain and act in their place the keysof the kingdom are with them and they can manage the affairsof the Church and direct all things arightNow all this does not lessen the character of 
 President Rigdon. Let him magnify his calling and Joseph willwant him beyond the veil. Let him be careful what he does lest that thread which bind us together be cut assumderMay God bless us all."Much more was said by Presient Youngwhich I did not write.Amasa Lyman said:--I do not arise to electioneer. I am gratifiedwith the open frank and plain exposition of President Young. He has seenthe relation I bear to my deceased brother. I never did conceive it gaveme precedance to go before the TwelveI do not make any exceptions to anything he has said. I believe there is no power or officer or means wanted tocarry on the work but what is in the Twelve. I am satisfied thatno man can carry on the work but the power which is in the Twelveas has been saidThere is one thing to secure the salvation ofthis people and that is not in union alone. It is for you to knowthe right and be united--it has been presented by President YoungAll I design to do is to redeem my pledgePresident Young has stood next to the ProphetJoseph with the Twelve and I have stood next to them and I willstand next to them. I have been at the back of Joseph Smith andwill be at the back of the Twelve forever and then we will besaved.There is no need of a President. We have a headhere. What is that head? The quorum of the Twelve Apostlesare that head. We now see the necessitty of the ApostleshipI might rise up as well as any other man toask for the Presidency; but I could not do it without endangering mysalvation. This is the power that turns the key to bestow salvationthrough all the land in the way that Joseph commenced it--the first one called to do the same in all the world. If Josephhad any power to bear off the kingdom of God the Twelve 
 have the same.I could not advocate the choosing a President and myself a candidateso then you know the place I occupy is to stand to the Twelve the same as theTwelve did to Joseph when on one side or the other. I do not want to go beforethem or to fall asleep. I want to see the kingdom roll forth by our unitedfaith and efforts"President Rigdon called upon W. W. Phelps to speak inhis behalf as he could not speak himselfW. W. Phelps arose and said:--With the knowledge I haveI cannot but suppose that this congregation will act right this day. I believeenough has been said to prepare the minds of the people to actI have known many of them for 14 years and I havealways known them to submit with defference to the authorities of the ChurchI have seen the Elders of Israel and the people take their lives in theirhands and go without purse or scrip in winter and in summer Ihave seen them prepare for war and ready to pour out their hearts bloodand that is an evidence that they will walk by counselI am happy to see this little lake of faces andto see the same disposition and spirit manifested here today asit was the day after the bloody tragedy when Joseph and HyrumSmith was brought home dead to this city: then you submitted tothe law's slow delay and handed the matter over to God. AndI see the same thing here today. You are now determined asone man to sustain the authorities of the Church and I am happythat the men who were on Joseph's right and left hand submitthemselves to the authority of the Priesthood.I have feelings about this especially for PresidentRigdon and I want to say that there is a quorum that the Twelve belong to and that the people will receive an endowment. I broughtPresident Rigdon into that quorum and he receved in part the blessings. Icould not bear the thought of President Rigdon going into the worldhe did receive part and I hope he will submitI want Brother Amasa Lyman to stand on 
 the side of the Twelve and they are wanted there still. let them goon and sustain them in that high office. You cannot put in aguardian of the ChurchWe have hitherto walked by sight and if any manwanted to know anything he had only to go to brother Joseph.Joseph is gone but he has not left us comfortlessI want to say that brother Joseph came andenlightened me two days after he was burried: he came to me thesame as when he was alive and in a moment appeared to me inhis own house. He said tell the drivers to drive on. I askedif the building was on wheels?  He said certainly. I spoke and away it went. We drove allround the hills and valleys. He then told the drivers to driveon over the hill into town. I told him Devil Creek was beforeus. He said drive over Devil Creek; I dont care for Devil Creekor any other creek, and we did so; then I awoke.There is a combination of persons in this city whoare in continual intercourse with William and Wilson Law who areat the bottom of the matter to destroy all that stand for Josephand there are persons now in this city who are only wanting powerto murder all who still stand for him; but let us go ahead andbuild up the Temple and then you will be endowed: when theTemple is compleated all the honourable mothers in Israel willbe endowed as well as the Elders.If they want to do right uphold the Twelve;If they die I am willing to die with them: but do your dutyand you will be endowed. I will sustain the Twelve as long as Ihave breath.When Joseph was going away he said he was goingto die and I said I was willing to die with him; but as I am nowalive as a lawyer in Israel I am determined to liveI want you all to recolect that Joseph and Hyrum have only been removed from the earth and they nowcounsel and converse with the Gods beyond the reach of powder 
 and ball.Parley P. Pratt remarked: What has been said has been wellsaid. If there are men here who are our enemies I tell you when they willcease to be here: they will be here while you will deal with them. If Iexchange property or deal with men I do it with those whom I know to befaithfulIf there are wicked men here it is because we support themStop dealing with them and they will go away. Will I support them?No; I would deal with all honest men whom I know to be such.I am willing to do good to all men especiallyto the household of faith. Our enemies will cease to dwell here whenyou cease to deal with them. Mobs and wicked men will ceasewhen you cease to support them. I know we can all live andbe happy too when we deal with honest men. If a man wantsa doctor or a lawyer he will send directly for the worst man he canfind. I would die a natural death sooner than I would havea wicked doctor to help me off. I would go without sueing allthe days of my life before I would go to a lawyer to sue. I willnot say anything about the merchants because you all know themPresident Brigham Young again arose and said:"There is more business than can be done this afternoon but we canaccomplish all we want to have done without without callingthis convention of the whole Church. I am going to present toyou the leading itemsI do not ask you to take my counsel or advisealone but every one of you act for yourself; but if brother Rigdonis the person you want to lead you vote for him but notunless you intend to follow him and support him asyou did Joseph. Do not say so unless you mean totake his counsel hereafterAnd I would say the same for theTwelve. Dont make a covenant to support them unlessyou intend to abide by their counsel and if they do not 
 counsel you as you please dont turn round and oppose them.I want every man before he enters into acovenant to know what he is going to do; but we want to knowif this people is going to support the Priesthood. In the nameof Israel's God if you say you will, do soWe want men appointed to take charge ofthe business that did lay on the shoulders of Joseph. Letme say to you that this kingdom will spread more than everThe Twelve have the power now the Seventies the Elders andall of you can have power to go and build up the kingdomin the name of Israel's God.Nauvoo will not hold all the people who will come into the kingdom. We want to build the Templeso as to get our endowment and if we do our best and Satanwill not let us build it we will go into the wilderness andwe will receive the endowment for we will receive anendowment anyhowWill you abide our counsel? I againsay my soul for any man's if they will abide our counselthat they will go right into heaven. We have all the signsand tokens to give to the porter at the door and he will let usinI ask you as quorums do you want BroRigdon to stand forward as your leader your guide yourspokesman. President Rigdon wants me to bring upthe other question first and that is does the Church want andis it their ownly desire to sustain the Twelve as the First Presidencyof this people?Here are the Apostles the Bible the Book ofMormon the Doctrine and Covenants they are written on thetablet of my heart. If the Church want the Twelve to stand as the head--the First Presidency of the Church and atthe head of this kingdom in all the world stand next to Joseph 
 walk up unto their calling and hold the keys of this kingdom every manevery woman every quorum is now put in order and you are now thesole controllers of it.All who are in favour of this in all the congregation ofthe Saints manifest it by holding up the right hand. There was a universal vote. If there are any of the contrary mind--every man and every woman who does not want the Twelve to presidelift up your hands in like manner. No hands up. Thissupersedes the other question and trying it by quorumsWe feel as though we could take brotherRigdon in our bosom along with us. We want such men asbrother Rigdon. He has been sent away by brother Joseph tobuild up a kingdom. Let him keep the instructions andcalling; let him raise up a mighty kingdom in Pittsburgand we will lift up his hands to Almighty God. I thinkwe may have a printing office and a gathering there. Ifthe devil still trys to kill us he will have enough to do.The next is President Marks. Our feelingsis to let him stand as President of the Stake as heretoforeWe can build the Temple &c.You did not know who you had amongstyou. Joseph so loved this people that he gave his life forthem. Hyrum loved his brother and this people unto deathJoseph and Hyrum have given their lives for the Church.But very few knew Joseph's character. He loved you unto death. You did not know it until after his death. He hasnow sealed his testimony with his bloodIf the Twelve had been here we wouldnot have seen him given up. He should not have been given up. He was in your midst but you did not kow himHe has been taken away for the people are not worthy ofhimThe world is wide. I can preach in England 
 Ireland Scotland France Germany &c; I can preach in all the world andthe devils cannot find us. I will sware to you I will not be given up.There is much to be done. You have men among you who sleep with one eye open. The foundationis laid by our Prophet and we will build thereon. No otherfoundation can be laid but that which is laid and we willhave our endowment if the Lord willAs the authorities do not want us to domilitary duty dont do it. If it is necessary my kneckis ready for the knife. As for myself I am determinedto build up the kingdom of God and by the bye there willbe a gleaning of grapes and it may be said "to your tentsO Israel"We can build on the foundation whichwas laid by the Prophet. Joseph has finished his workand all the Devils in hell and all the mobers on earth couldnot take his life until he had accomplished his work. Godsaid I will put a veil over his eyes and lead him upto the slaughter like a sheep to be killed for the peopleare not worthy of him though God loves this peopleLet no man suppose that the kingdomis rent from you that it is not organized. If all the quorums ofthe Church were slain except the High Priest they would rise upwith the keys of the kingdom and have the power of the Priesthoodupon them and build up the kingdom and the devil cannothelp himselfYou can go to a healthy country buy the landand dont let a cursed scoundrel get in your midst. Let there begood men good women and whenever a man comes with a wheelbarrowfull of goods dont let him land dont let him a house or buy of himSuppose we had ten thousand such places and 
 increasing in greatness perfectly free from these poor devils we should feelbetter than we do now. Let us all be humble and get our endowmentsall be humble industrious and prudent what sort of a kingdom would itbe? The foundation is laid for more than we can think or talkabout todayIs it the will of this congregation that they willbe theth tithed until the Temple is finished as they have heretofore been?If so signify it by the uplifted hand {The vote was unanimous}The men will act who never acted beforeand they will have the power and authority to do it. Is it theminds of the congregation to loose the hands of the Twelve andenable us to go and preach to all the world? We want to knowthe feelings of the people. Is it your will to support the Twelvein all the world in their missions. {The congregation susttainedthis question by a unanimous vote} Will you leave it tothe Twelve to dictate about the finances of the Church and willit be the mind of this people that the Twelve teach what willbe the duties of the Bishops in handling the affairs of theChurch. I want this because Twelve men can do it just aswell as calling this immense congregation together at any othertime {A unanimous vote}We shall have a Patriarch and theright is in the family of Joseph Smith--his brothers his sonsor some ones of his relations. Here is Uncle John he hasbeen ordained a Patriarch. Brother Samuel would havetaken the office had he been alive. It would have beenhis right. The right is in Uncle John or one of his brothers{read Doctrine and Covenants sec III Par 17} I know that it wouldhave belonged to Samuel but as it is if you leave it to theTwelve they will wait until they know who is the manWill you leave it to the Twelve and they dictate in thematter {unanimous vote} I know it will be let alone for thepresent. 
 I feel to bring up brother Rigdon. We are ofone mind with him and he with us. Will this congregation upholdhim in the place he occupies by the prayer of faith and let himbe one with us and we with him {unanimous} The Twelve will dictate and see to other matters. There will be a committeefor the Temple and now let men stand to their posts andbe faithful"The Conference adjourned to Oct, the 6th withthe Benediction from Elder Parley P. Pratt.The next day I attended a council and weappointed two Trustees in Trust for the Church--namely George Millerand N. K. WhitneyNauvoo at this juncture of our Churchhistory was seeing gloomy times. The Prophet and Patriarch wasgone from us and there was but little ambition in the peoplefor a time to do anything though they were very busy workingon the Temple.A  Council of the TwelveMonday August the 12thPresent: Brigham Young Heber C.

It wasmy mind in the first place that we should have suitable timeto meditate upon all matters and weigh them even every subjectwherin we felt interested. When the question was asked me if 
 they should continue to baptize for the dead I said I had no counsel togive upon that subject at present but should think it not best to attendto it at that timeI have learned some things I did not knowwhen I came home. I discover a disposition in the sheep toscatter abroad now the Shepherd is taken away. I do not saythat it will never be right for this people to go from here or scatterabroad but let them wait until the time comes and until theyget counsel to do soThe report has gone through the city that the Twelve have secret understanding with those menwho are going away and taking companies with them thatthey shall take all they can and that although the Twelve willblow it up yet privately they wish it to go on but if it wasthe last words I had to say before going into the eternal worldI would sware by the Holy Trinity that it is utterly false andand not one word of truth in it. There is no man who has anyright to lead away one soul out of this city by the consent of theTwelve except Lyman Wight and George Miller who have hadthe privilege of taking the Pine Company where they pleasedbut not another soul has the consent of the Twelve to gowith themThere is no man who has any libertyto lead away people into the wilderness from this Church orto lead them anywhere else by the consent of the Twelve or theChurch except the case above named and I tell you in thename of Jesus Christ that if Lyman Wight and George Millertake a course contrary to our counsel and will not act inconcert with us they will be damned and go to destructionIf men will not stop striving to be great and exalted andlead away parties from us and striving to weaken ourhands they will fall and not rise again and I will destroytheir influence in this Church with the help of God and 
 my brethren. I wish you to distinctly understand that the counsel ofthe Twelve is for every family that does not belong to the Pine Company to stay here in Nauvoo build up the Temple and get their endowmentDont scatter. United we stand divided we fall.It has been whispered about that all who gointo the wilderness with Wight and Miller will get their endowmentbut they cannot give an endowment in the wilderness. If wedo not carry out the plan laid down by Joseph and the patternhe has given for us to work by we cannot get any furtherendowment. I want it to sink deep into your hearts thatyou may remember it. I repeat it. Let me reason with youIf you stir up the flame of dissent will you get an endowment? No.You get a party to run here and another there and divide our strengthand weaken our hands and we shall be left and our enemies will flockaround us and destroy us. In that case you will not get yourendowment but will sink and not rise--go to hell and not to the bosomof AbrahamDo the people leave here because they areaffraid? Do you fear those who have power to kill the bodyIf you leave this place for fear of mob before God tells you to goyou will have no place of rest but you will flee from place toplace and go like the Jews until God raises up some otherpeople to redeem you for if the Devil scares you from thisplace he will scare you from all other places.Let no man go from this place but thePine Company brethren but stay here sow plant & build. Put in yourplowshares into the praries. One plowshare will do more todrive off the mob than two guns. Let us stay herewhere the bones of Joseph and Hyrum Samuel Don Carlosand Father Smith are. Joseph has said if I am slainin battle or fall in any way I want my body laid inNauvoo. I had rather have the dead body of the Prophetthan some men who are alive and I should rather havethe clothes of the Prophet stuffed with straw for President 
 of the United States than any man whose name is now beforethe [text changes to pencil] nation [text changes back to ink] for a candidate for he would not do as much harm We want to build the Temple in this place. If we have to build it as the Jews built the walls of the Temple in Jerusalemwith a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. Howeasily some men are scared. I have never been frightenedyet and I know other men who have notDo you suppose the mouth of God is closed to be opened no more unto us. If this was so Iwould not give the ashes of a rie straw for the salvationof the Church. If God has ceased to speak by theHoly Ghost or revelation there is no salvation; but this is notthe caseThere seems to be a disposition manifestedby many to leave Nauvoo and go into the wilderness orsomewhere else. But what if we should go into thewilderness and we should ask God to give us anendowment and he should ask us if we were driven from Nauvoo and who drove us. The Devildrove us would be the answer. "Well" he might say "did you not know that I had power over thedevil" Yes; but one said "I would not give a Jackknife for all Nauvoo and another said I would notgive a pair of mules for the best farm in Hancock County& I was affraid.Would the Lord give an endowment to a people who was frightened away from their dutyThese who are wishing to lead away parties contrary to counselI would not wish them damned worse than to have a companyafter their own likeing for they will soon quaral amongthemselvesIf we should go into the wildernessand ask the Lord to give us an endowment he might askus saying "Did I not give you rock in Nauvoo to 
 build the Temple with?""Yes.""Did I not through my Providence furnish men to quarryand cut the stone and prepare it for the building""Yes.""Did I not give you means to build the Temple there?"Yes.""Very well, had you died in Nauvoo on the wallsof the Temple or in your fields I would have taken you to myself and raised up men to officiate for you and you wouldhave enjoyed the highest glory. Did you make asacrifice by tithing?"No""Well I dont wonder you did not believe I had power over the devil."Such may go away. But I want to havethe faithful stay here and settle this city. We shall require thetruth of all your property as the tithing for the building of the Templesfor the poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and living bythe Church hereafter so that I can give my whole time to thebuisness of the Church. I have always supported myself heretoforein all my travels and laboursWhile in England in one year we circulated 60,000tracts upon our doctrine. This ought to be done in all the world andit can be where the Elders are faithful to their callingJoseph the Testator has been preserved tillnow but he has now sealed his testimony with his blood and his testamentshould be put in force. While the Testator lived it was all in his ownhands but now he is deadThere is no remission of sins without the shedingof blood. You will soon wake up and know things as they areThere has been a great debt paid. There will be no need of moreblood of the saints being shed at present. By and by you will 
 understand and see that all is rightWo! Wo! Wo! unto all who have shed the blood of the Saints and the Lord's Anointed. It must needs be that offencescome but wo unto them by whom they comeTo those who want to go away from thisplace I would say wait until the time comes. I will give youthe key. North and South America is Zion and as soon asthe Temple is done and you get your endowment you can go and build up stakes but dont be in haste. Wait until the Lordsays, go.If you have the Spirit of God you can discernright from wrong. When all is right in the Priesthood and a manrises up and speaks in the Spirit of God and just right all willsay Amen; but when a man rises up and talks as smooth as oil if he is not right there will be many queries about it. It willnot edify the body. I give this as a keyYou may go all over North and South America[text changes to pencil] ^and build up stakes^ [text reverts to ink] when the time comes. The whole continant of America must beorganized into Districts and presiding Elders appointed overeach district. The time has come when all things mustbe set in order. I have had these things upon my mind alllong time. The time has come now for bickering to ceaseThere must be a strict order of things and we are no longer boundto harbor blacklegs counterfeiters & bogus makers. We knowall about them. They have been in our midst long enough. Iadvise all the Saints to have no dealing with such men. Letthem alone. The time has come that they should be whipedout of our midst. Let those men alone--let the ungodlydealers alone. And as to the Doctors who are in our midstwho are our enemies I would say let them alone also for I haveno doubt that three to one who have died in this place had adoctorAnd I would say wo unto you lawyers 
 for your whole study is to put down truth and put a lie in its stead. I wantthe lawyers to know that we have common sense. They want to makeyou believe that when you spell baker you mean cider or wiskeyNow let the Doctors and Lawyers alone and leave off bitterness andevil speaking and you will build the Temple and get an endowmentAll you lawyers go away and let us alone and when we get full of thedevil and want you we will send for you. We may then have amore convenient seasonI want to say to the Saints do not harbourblacklegs counterfeiters & bogus makers. Wipe them away. It is timeto carry out the design of our Prophet. Do cease to employ doctorslawyers and merchants who will use your plurse and then mobyou. Store your grain in Nauvoo for you will want itthere to eat while you are building the TempleI want to say to the hands upon the Templebe united and to the Committee I would say dont turn away anyperson because he is an Englishman Scotchman Irishman or any othernation but employ every man you can and build the Temple andyour homes.I would rather pay out every cent to build upthis place and get an endowment even if I was driven the next minutewithout anything to take with me.As to the doctors let them go. I can provethat a doctor in this place doctored a woman who was in the family wayand he did not know it until she was delivered and both the womanand child died and if you employ them you will all die; but thetime has come when you need no longer support themThere is a distinction between the law ofthe land and the law of the Church. You have the privilege ofkeeping all shops that does not come in contact with the law of thethe State County or City so I will evade the law says the dealerand give away wiskey and sell a little tobaco or something elseand charge enough for both but the law of the Church will reach 
 such men if they are members for they will be cut off.I had a dream which I will here relate. I saw a fruit tree and I went into the tree to search for fruit. Isoon descovered that some of the main branches on the top growingfrom the main body was dead. It seamed necessary to cutoff the dead branches in order to save the tree. So I toldsome person to help me cut them off and he steped on to a largegreen limb. They were affraid it would break so I put my shoulder under it and held it up while he cut off the deadbranches. It cracked the green limb but it did not breakAfter we cut off the dead branches the wound healed up andthe tree grew finelyNow let us cut off the dead branchesof the Church that good fruit may grow and the voice willsoon be heard go and build Zion and the great Temple of the Lord.A word unto the Seventies. They willbe organized into their different quorums and a presidency ofof seven men will be chosen out of the first seventy to presideover each quorumNow as you have been warned let every man warn his neighbour and we will give every manhis appointment as soon as convenientMay the Lord bless you in the nameof Jesus Christ Amen.In the afternoon the assembly was againaddressed in a simlar strain by Heber C. Kimball andPresident Young but I was at home writing and hencedid not take notes; and in the evening in company withMrs Woodruff I rode out to bro John Benbows and spent thenight. We came to the conclusion to leave our only sonWilford with brother and Sister Benbow while I took 
 my mission to England accompanied by my wifeReturning the next day I met in Council with the TwelveWe conversed concerning the route we should take and it was thought thatthe northern route would be the healthiest. Among other things somedreams were rehearsed. The following was told by myself:"I met with Joseph Smith in the congregationof the Saints. He had his old Hebrew and German Bible and preachedto the Saints but he seamed to be too thronged by the people and herose up lifted up a curtain and passed into another room where thepeople could not disturb him and there he was going to teachthe people.The following is from the hand of BrighamYoung.Certificate"I hereby certify that Elder Wilford Woodruff has receiveda mission by order of the quorum of the Twelve to England topreside over the Churches in that land and I feel to bless himin the name of the Lord with all belonging to or dwellingbeneath his roof at this time consisting of his wife andchildren and sister Mary            who is assisting themto get on their journey.Brigham YoungOn the 23rd I visited Emma Smith thewidow of the Prophet. She let me have a piece of oakfor a staff out of the coffin of the martyred Joseph. Shealso let me have a pair of white cotton gloves a  [changes to pencil] nd [changes back to ink] Mrs. Woodruff apocket [inserted in pencil] cotton [change back to ink] handkerchief both of which were [unclear] [inserted in pencil] worn [change back to ink] by the Prophet whilelivingWe called upon Sister Mary Smith widowof Hyrum the Patriarch and she gave us some hair from 
 the heads of Joseph, Hyrum Samuel and Don Carlos Smith allbrothers and the same parents. I also obtained some hair of thequorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My intention in obtaining the hair was thatI might put a portion of each in the knob of my staff as a relickof those noble men--the master Spirits of the nineteenth centuryI next visited Mother Lucy Smith theparent of Joseph--the Lord's Anointed--and of Hyrum Samueland Don Carlos, and the wife of Joseph the First Patriarch ofthe last dispensation all of whom directly or indirectly fell martyrsfor the cause of God. The old Mother and Prophetess feltmost heart broken at the loss of her children and from the wickedand cruel treatment she had received from the hands of theworld. She beg[g]ed a blessing at my hand. I laid myhands upon her head and by the Spirit of God proclaimedthe following--BlessingofMother Lucy Smithunder the hands of Wilford Woodruffon the 23 of August 1844Beloved Mother in IsraelAccording to your request I laymy hands upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazarethand by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the keys of the kingdomof God to bestow a blessing upon you for thou are worthy ofall blessingsAs I laid my hands upon thy husbandJoseph the Senior, the Patriarch of the Church by his requestto bless him as he lay upon his bed like Jacob of old readyto gather up his feet and sleep with his fathers and I about 
 to take my departure for foreign nations over the sea which was the last timewe met on earth in like manner do I esteem it a blessing and privelege tolay my hands upon your head in your decline of life to leave with youmy parting blessingI am again called to bid farewell to my nativeland and visit foreign climes to bear record of the words of God. We maynever meet again on earth but I thank my God that I have thisprivilege of blessing thee for thou art the Greatest Mother inIsrael. The sons which thou hast borne and cherished are themost noble spirits that ever graced humanity or tabernacled in theflesh. Their work shall be had in honourable remembrancethroughout all generations. Though counted among transgressorsthey like the Messiah have shed their blood for the sins ofthe people and freely offered their lives and sealed their testimony[changes to pencil] with their blood.[changes back to ink] Thou hast lived to see the fall of thy sons by the rage of Gentile hands but like an eternal rock inthe midst of the ocean thou has stood and God has given theethe desire of thy heart in seeing the keys of this kingdomheld in the hands of thy posterity so planted on the earththat they shall never be taken from it until He reigns whoseright it is to reignLet thy heart be comforted in the midstof thy sorrow for thou shalt be had in honourable remembranceforever in the congregations of the righteous. Thou shalt beremembered in thy wants during the remainder of thy days andwhen thou art called to depart thou canst lie down in peacehaving seen the salvation of God in laying an everlastingfoundation for the deliverance of Israel through the instrumentalityof thy sonsI seal upon your head all the blessings of the fulness of the gospel of the "First Born" and allthose blessings which have been sealed upon your headheretofore. If we meet no more on earth we shall meet 
 in the morn of the first resurrection when you shall receive thronesand powers and dominion and kingdom with thy husband in hisexaltation in the lineage of his fathers.I seal these blessings upon your headin the name of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the HolyPriesthood: Amen.Set Apart For My Mission(Nauvoo August 24 1844)The following blessing was confered upon my head andI was set apart by the Twelve for my mission to England to takecharge of all the Churches in Europe. Elder John Taylor was mouthpiece for the quorumBrother Woodruff, We lay our handsupon your head in the name of Jesus Christ and by theauthority of the Holy Priesthood to seal upon your head ablessing and set you apart unto the important mission whichis appointed unto you of the Lord by the voice of the Twelveto go over the sea to England to take charge of the churchesthroughout that land; and we ask God the Eternal Fatherin the name of Jesus Christ to bless you with healthand strength open the door before you and your familythat you may have food and rament and money and all thingsnecessary to make you comfortable and that the power of God mayrest upon you in a greater degree than in any missionbefore. We seal upon your head these blessings. You shaltbe preserved to finish your mission and return home with yourfamily and meet in the Temple of the Lord and rejoice thereinand shout Hosanna. You shall have power and wisdom toaccomplish the design of your missions and shall have the desire[changes to pencil]^of your heart^ [changes back to ink] given you in all things in righteousness before God." 
 The next day was Sunday and I was called upon toaddress the congregation of Saints assembled in Nauvoo as I was about to leavefor my mission to England. The following is a few of the items I presentedto the people in my discourse"There is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almightygiveth it understanding. It is through this principle that this congregation isassembled together at this place. You had understanding of the things of Godand His Spirit. [changes to pencil] by the Spirit of God][changes back to ink] I have now one important declaration to make to youand that is that inasmuch as you will be invited in heart and mind andin action in supporting your counsellors--the priesthood of God--theauthorities of the Church and follow the counsel given you as youhave endeavoured to follow the counsel of the Prophet while he was living you will be safe and blessed and will prosper but if you are divided andreject the counsel of God you will fall. Union and faithfulness is yoursalvation. It is true you have been led by one of the best men thatever graced humanity or tabernacled in the flesh but he is gone; hehas sealed [h]is testimony with his blood. He loved this people unto death.I would now call upon this people to beunited in building up [inserted in pencil] on [end of insertion] the foundation which the Prophet Joseph haslaid. You have been called to suffer much in the cause in whichyou are engaged but if judgement begins at the house of God Babylon willnot escape and if there is a fire in a green tree a dry tree will notescape. There is no people [inserted in pencil] more [end of insertion] prepared for the shock that is comingon the earth than [inserted in pencil] the [end of insertion] Latter-day Saints. The object we have is tosecure blessings beyond the veil in the first resurrection. Thisis what we are preparing for.Again I would say let not the Saints betroubled because they have lost their Prophet. I would ask becausethe Prophet has sealed his testimony with his blood does that destroythe gospel or take away the power of God. Is truth annihalatedor has the priesthood found a burying place? I tell you nayHis testimony is now in force. Therefore my counsel is to 
 follow the example of those who have gone before and be faithful untodeath. If you will be united and go to with your whole mightsin building that Temple you have power to accomplish it andget an endowment"I earnestly exhorted them to faithfulness andrequested their prayers in my  behalf and asked forgiveness of anything which I might have done wrong and bid the congregationfarewellJoseph Gave the Keys of the Kingdom to the TwelveI was followed by President Brigham YoungAlso Elders P. P. Pratt and Orson Hyde spoke and testified thatJoseph the Prophet had ordained anointed and appointed the Twelveto lead the church and had given them the keys of the kingdom forthat purpose. W. W. Phelps and R Cahoon bore testimonythat Joseph said unto the Twelve "Upon your shoulders thekingdom of God must rest in all the world. Now round upyour shoulders and bear it."Many important things were spoken by thebrethren at this time which I had not the leasure to writeNext day I went to the river with MrsWoodruff to be baptized for some of our [inserted in pencil] dead [end of insertion] friends. I was administeredto under the hands of Elder G. A Smith as proxy for five of myfamily. I also baptized by wife for five of her friends. WillardRichards confirmed us.On the Temple at MidnightAfter preparing for my departure bidding farewellto the Saints and blessing many until midnight of the 27thin company with Brother and Sister Smoot and HannahElls my wife and I walked to the Temple of the Lord inNauvoo. As we approached we lifted up our eyes toview the sacred scene which the silver moon illuminatedwith the brightness of her glory. After gazing a few 
 moments upon her walls and her capitols which were standing upon the groundcompleted we all as of one accord ascended the ladders on to the top of the walls:several of the police and friends followed our example among whom was GeneralRichard and Elder Godard.We repared to the southwest corner of the Temple and therewe bowed our knees upon the top corner stone which was prepared to receive itscapitol and thenre with uplifted hands towards heaven I called upon the Godof Abraham Isaac and Jacob; offering the gratitude of our hearts for preservingour lives and giving us power to so far build the Temple; praying that itmight be finished and the Saints receive their endowments to plant the work ofGod in all the earth; asking the Father for a just reckoning for the sheddingof the blood of the Lord's Anointed; praying Him to enable us to fulfil our missionand return to the bosom of the Church; invoking a double portion of the Spirit ofJoseph to rest upon Brigham and the Twelve to bear off the Kingdom in all the world and for the power of the priesthood to rest upon all the quorums and Eldersof Israel and dedicating myself family and all belonging to me in the nameof Jesus Christ unto the Lord God.After prayers we descended and returned to our homeswith joy and peace in our hearts.Letter of AppointmentNauvoo August 26th 1844To All Elders and Saints in Europe Greeting:We send our beloved brother Wilford Woodruffto England to take charge of all business transactions pertaining to theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both spiritual and temporalWe wish you to give dilligent heed to his counsel in all things and as wehave not the opportunity of informing you of what has transpired thisseason, by letter, our beloved brother will make known unto you all thingsWe wish the brethren to be faithful and dilligentin keeping all the commandments of God and in hearkening to the counselsof those who are sent to counsel them.

 Leaves Nauvoo for EnglandOn the 28th I parted with the quorum of the Twelve ^at the Temple^ and started onmy mission. Our company consisted of myself wife and two children HiramClark and wife and Cap. Dan Jones and wife and three brethren who camewith their teams to convey us to Chicago where we arrived on the 7th ofthe next month, September; and on the next day we went on board the propell [page damaged]Oswego to journey up the lakes on our way eastWe arrived with a fair breeze at the Manatow [Manitou]Islands at 12 o clock at noon and spent three hours there. With Mrs WoodruffI walked over the same beach that we walked over together after being wreckedon the Chesapeak in Sep 1841. It brought the scene fresh to our mindsWe wrote on some smooth stones concerning our wreck and our missionto England, our names dates &c.; and at three o clock we left the Islandand continued our journey.Cry of Fire at MidnightAfter leaving Detroit on the morning of the 17thwe sailed well through the day and evening until midnight when astrong wind arose the lake became rough and the boat rocked badlyand in the midst of it when we we were opposite the Cleveland lighthousea cry of Fire Fire Fire rang through the boat by the watch on deckWe immediately leaped from our births in our night clothes and eachone caught a bucket as best he could and I caught a bucket about halffull of water and ran barefoot as I was to the stern of the boat lookingfor the fire while some was running up stairs. I leaped into the engineroom and saw the fire in one corner of the stern of the boat. I ran over thepile of coal and dashed my water into the fire which was not larger thana half bushel measure at the same time a bucket of water flung by CaptDavis struck the fire and it was extinguished.There is nothing more terrible and alarming than thecry of fire at sea or on any water out of the reach of land. It is far more 
 Thursday, M, May 7 1896.The meeting of the First Presidency and Apos-les was held at the Temple at 11 A. M. There were presentPresidents Woodruff, Cannon and Smith; and of the Twelve,Prest. L. Snow, and Elders F. D. Richards, F. M. Lyman, J. H.Smith, H. J. Grant, J. W. Taylor and A. H. Cannon.Elder J. H. Smith reported by letter which was read,that in company with Prest. Horton D. Haight and his counselorMoroni Pickett, of the Cassia Stake, he had visited Grouse Creekand organized a new Bishopric, as follows: David H. Toyn Bishop,William P. Paskett, and Albert Richins counselors.Prest. Lorenzo Snow called attention to the form of baptism used in the Temples on behalf of the dead, in whichthe words "for the remission of your sins" was ^were^ interpolated,being different from the form of baptism for the living.Preisident Joseph F. Smith sad ^said^ he had noticed in baptiz-ing a person for health the words were used "for the renewl of your covanents, the remission of your sins and the restorationof your health". It was the unanimous sense of the Councilthat these forms should be corrected by letter of instructionsto the Temple Presidents.The question of a successor to Elder Anthon H. Lunedas President of the European Mission was considered, and onmotion of Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon, Elder Rulon S. Wells of the First Council of Seventies, was selected and appointed to suc-ceed Elder Lund in that position.President Cannon thought that the Twelve who were ableto travel could be sent from time to time to visit the variousmission^s,^ instead of being tied down to preside over either ofsuch missions.President Cannon reported that the work in the TongaIslands was of a most arduous character with very unsatisfactory results. It appeared that converts in that mission had not numbered one to ea^c^h missionary. He thought that in conse-

You do notmention your own health nor that of your family; but I presume that you are all well.I am much obliged to you for reminding us concerning the $800.00for Sam. I have had it enclosed to Cleo, and sent to your care. I hope it willreach all right. We feel greatly obliged to you for the trouble you have been atand sorry that you have been under the necessity of having to remind us of it.Mrs. Woodruff regrets that she did not see you when you werehere, and hopes that you did not feel offended at her not making her appearance. Shewas taking a bath at the time and hoped to see you again, when she would have ex-plained to you the reason why she did not receive you.When you come over the next time I hope to be able to give you aride in a vehicle and with a team that will please you. Mrs. Woodruff and myself thinkyou will be gratified to know that your suggestions on this point have been carriedout.With kind regards to yourself and family, in which my friendswith me join,I remain, as ever,Your old friend,W.

 Salt Lake City,Feb. 7th, 1884.Dear Br. Brigham Young:I have re-ceived two letters from youof January 7th & 9, but I havenot been able before now to answer them. I havespent only about one Sun-day per month for the last two months in Salt Lake.I left here Dec. 6th and re-turned Jany 1st; and since my return I have atten-ded Conferences in Nephi,Salt Lake, Box Elder, Logan,and expect to be in Mantion the 16th inst. In connec-tion with my travels I havehad to attend Councilsand keep up my journaland historical matters, soit has been hard work 
 quence ^o^f the indifference tof the people there to the Gospel,the missionaries should be withdrawn. This was fully endorsedby the brethren of the Council.President Cannon further suggested that one of theApostles should visit the Southern States mission, the Northernand eastern states Mission, and perhaps the same Apostle mightvisit the European Mission. This would be in accordance withthe decision that the Apostles should be brought into closertouch with the various missions.Brother Henry Puzey formerly counselor to Bishop JohnSharp of the 20th Ward, well known and respected among the Saints^,^was found dead this evening near the Guard House at Fort Doug-las. He had baeen ^seized with^ paralysis, and fallen into a ditch in whichthe water was not more than a foot deep. His head had come inacontact with a rock inflicting a woulnd above one of his eyes.He had been attacked before this, but had mearsureably recovered.The old gentleman was regarded with deep affection by all classesof the community. He was about 68 years of age, and leaves a wife, three Frank Henry Puzey William Charles Puzey sons and one daughter. 
 Salt Lake City, Apr. 16th, [18]83.Brothers Young & Grant.Dear Brethren:I havereceived several short letters fromyou since you left Salt Lake City.The first was dated Jan. 11th at Man-nassa—you had set apart 5 mis-sionaries. The second at SunsetMarch 2nd—you had been to Moaencopy,had visited the villages of theMoquis; Br. Lot Smith wrote mean account of your visit amongthem, which I was very glad toget. Your third and last letter waswritten by Br. Grant March 5th, andgave an account of the death ofLot Smith's child.I am interested in hearing of your labors among the Lamanitesand Saints and to know how youget along. We had a very inter-esting conference. Saturday and Sun- 
 to do justice to my correspon-dence but I will do the best I can. I mention thisso you may not think thatI intentionally neglected to answer your letters, for Iam deeply interested in yourletters and mission.I received a letter a fewdays since from Br. McDonald and one from JesseN. Smith—both were inter-esting.I am pleased to hearof the young men who arewilling to prepare themsel-ves for a mission to the Lamanites; for personallyI would much prefer to go on a mission amongthem than to the Gentiles.As to news in Utah, Ithink you get most of itfrom the Deseret News. I attendedthe funerals of Mary Van CottYoung and Hellen Beatie. Br.Jacob Gates has been down 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICECHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.OFLATTER-DAY SAINTS,P. O. BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T. Dec. 10th, 1889.Elder Brigham Young,Dear Brother:There is some business in Arizona that we would like youto attend to while you are down there. Inclosed you will find correspondence fromBp. Brinkerhoof, in which there are charges made against a son of Brother Lot Smith.It will be well to have those charges carefully investigated and not be decided uponmere rumor. Whatever is proper under the circumstances should be done by theauthorities there, under your counsel.There may be other things there which may require yourattention. If so, we hope you will find it convenient to have them cleared up.We have received a letter from Bp. McNeil, of Ramah—a let-ter which you read. It contained a statement of the condition of their land andthe offer that had been made to them for its sale to them. We understand that youwrote an answer, suggesting to them that they organize themselves into a companyand endeavor to buy the land on the terms that were offered, and to give the landitself as security. This would be a very good plan, especially if they can get itat a moderate interest. Something should be done to secure this land to the saints,as Bp. McNeil represents it as a desirable place and one that others covet and woulddoubtless gladly purchase; but if it passes out of the hands of the people it willcompel them to break up their homes and be a serious loss to them, which should beavoided if it possibly can be.

F.Macdonald on the 20th inst.—upon which occasion he submittedto us a power of attorney given to him by the Messrs. GarciaBrothers of the City of Mexico, conveying to him absolute author-ity to dispose of certain of their lands immediately adjacent toour settlements in Mexico—it was decided to refer this matterto a committee consisting of yourself (as chairman). Elders MosesThatcher, George Teasdale, A. F. Macdonald and Henry Eyring,with the request that you give Bro. Macdonald a hearing in re-gard to this matter, and satisfy yourselves as to the advisabil-ity of purchasing the lands for colonization purposes: and inorder that this may be done it will be necessary that the prop-erty be inspected that its character and suitableness for col-onization may be ascertained without question or doubt.We may say that Bro. Macdonald reported to us that he ac-cepted of this poerer of attorney on condition that we sanctionhis doing so; and it is understood, in case it shall be deemedadvisable to enter into negotiations, that Bro.

We had great satisfaction in sending you a cablegram announc-ing that all the indictments hanging over you in the third District Courthad been dismissed by Judge Zane, on motion of Preosecuting Attorney Varienand we now take pleasure in informing you that we have decided on your re-lease to return home in time to be present at the dedication of the Templein this city next April. We have not yet decided who shall be your suc-cessor in the Presidency of the European Mission, but at present incline tothe idea of having some one of the Elders now laboring under your presi-dency appointed to take temporary charge between the time you leave Liver-pool and the arrival of your successor, who in all probability will startfrom here immediately after the conclusion of the services incident to theAnnual Conference and the Temple dedication. We would like you to informus if there are any brethren whom you deem suitable to assume this tempor-ary charge of the mission, and we will advise you of our action.With constant prayers for your welfare, and for all Israel,We remain, Your brethren,W WoodruffGeo.

Elder Brigham Young,Snowflake, Apache Co.,Arizona.Dear Brother:We are in receipt of two favors fromyou, one under date of the 1st and the other the 4th inst.We are very glad to learn that you were so fortunate as to escape the snares of our enemies whichhad been so well arranged for your capture. We sin-cerely hope that you will be prudent in your movementsand keep out of the hands of your enemies.We agree with you that Brother Martineauscase, if investigated at all, should be investigated thor-oughly, and in referring this business to you and the

Macdonald sug-gested that these lands would be very suitable as a place of set-tlement of the Papago Indians who are now in Arizona, 1200 ofwhom, he said, are members of the church. He will be able toexplain to the committee the situation of those Indians whom, be-ing landless, it would be conferring a great benefit of them to acquire title to land in Mexico, on the terms proposed by theGarcia brothers.We refer this whole business to your committee for in-vestigation: and should you decide that the removal of the Papa-go Indians is feasible, we should be pleased to have the committeeframe some plan of removal, and submit to us.Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

We regret that they should be in sucha condition, and such poor prospects for winter-ing their stock.

 We trust that you will find it convenient while you are there to bestow some thoughtand attention upon the indebtedness of Snowflake and Woodruff for the lands theyhave purchased. You are familiar with all the details of this, and therefore we arenot under the necessity of mentioning them; but it is important that everythingthat can be done should be done bny the people there tio meet future payments on thelands. You have some knowledge of our condition as a Church in regard to funds.We are under the necessity of borrowing to meet our current cash expenses, and or-dinary prudence would suggest that no more load be laid upon us of this characterthan is absolutely unavoidable.With love, and praying the Lord to bless you and preserve you in your journeying and labors,We remainYour Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

It is a veryserious position to be in, to be accused, as he has been,of misusing funds dedicated to the Lord and paid inby His people; and wrongdoing in that direction shouldnot be permitted to exist among us. If the accusationsbe false, it is due to him, as well as to the people,that they should be brought to light and disproved.No doubt you get the papers and learnall that is being done here in regard to the Riceiver-ship. We have nothing much to complain of, asidefrom the general enormity of the law itself and the cunningly devised scheme of robbery which is embodied in its provisions, excepting the seizure of our books bythe Receiver—books containing our current business, andwhich the Government has no claim upon.

I do not know how this is, but I think onesettlement with him ought to be sufficient. I Fearalso that the committee require him to vent his brandon his stock.

Noman should vent the brand on his own cattle. His ideahas been carried to me that the Sub Committee want tosettle with him over again. My opinion is that onesettlement with a man, do able with, as he has been, oughtto be sufficient. I think Lot has been roughly handled.If there has been any property made in that Institu-tion, he has been the man most interested in makingit. I was there for two years with him, and he didmore work than any two men in the order. He cut the

Owing to the peculiar situation inwhich we are placed, there was not that defense made,and that firm though quiet resistance offered to theseizure, that would have been had we been free or ina position to have given counsel upon the subject. Ourattorneys assured us that they could not touch thesebooks, and we rested somewhat upon this assurance.Of course, you have learned that the Temple Block,the Tithing Offices, the Gardo House, the HistorianOffice and the President's Office are all in our handsat the present time. We pay $7500 a month for the Gardo House, $100 a month for the Temple Block,and $20000 a month for the Tithing Offices and premisesand the Historian Office. We have thought it better torent these various premises than to allow them to be rentedto others.

Wemay probably rent the Tithing Office of him,but the Temple block we shall do nothing aboutexcept to defend our right to it as far as wecan. In considering this matter we thought itbetter to rent the Tithing Office and buildingsbecause it will be inconvenient for us tomove elsewhere and erect such buildings aswe need, and it will also enable us to usethe personal property, such as delivery wagons,teams &c.The brethren are in the enjoyment of goodhealth.

 have the brand that his stock are branded with.He ought to have that, I think it is due him. He mightpay if the committee consider it necessary, buthe certainly ought to have it. I myself, do not thinkthat any man that went into that order and left ittook any less stock or property than what he put in,and I think, generally, more. Whatever increaseof property there was in that order I am satisfiedthat Lot Smith was the main instrument inmaking it. I was with him two years and I amsatisfied he doid more work than any two menin the order. He cut every acre of Wheat andLucerne. He was at the head of all the water ditchesand led in all the hard work. There has been agood deal of prejudice against him for years past.He went there by order of President Young and hastried to carry out his counsel in all respects on thatwork. I think that a man, that has gone throughwhat he has from this youth up for the Church andKingdom of God, ought not to be crushed injustly. 
 Hay, Wheat and Lucerne. He was at work on the waterditches, and the raggedest man in Camp. I dont believethere was a man went into the order but what took awaywith him when he left, more than he took there. There has beena great deal of prejudice against him from quarters whereit ought not to be expected. He has got his imperfections andsome of them strange ones; but he should not be persecuted.He went to that country under the counsel of President Brigham Young and he has done the best he could to carry out hiscounsel. I think when the committee had once settledwith him they ought to let him alone and not continueto annoy him, and the committee ought to let him havethe branding iron that his cattle are branded with.I shall write to Brother Bushman upon this matter. Iwould like you Brother Udall to do what you can to seethat the settlement with Lot is upon a fair basis. If hehas not been settled with in that manner the committeeshould settle up with him. I want to know how hestands. I wish you would write to me and let me knowhow his affairs stand.

We have written a letter to the Board of Directors of the St. George StakeAssociation, and I hope some arrangements may be made with Brother Judd, so thathe can put the Factory in working order, for the benefit of the people and of thestockholders. We are also making some arrangements with Brother Thompson to builda stone reservoir at his place and pipe from there to the Temple, instead of fromthe Springs, which will do away with the engine and tank at the Temple.

Whatever the final result of our affairs may be in the courts,I feel to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in that you came into our employand were associated with us in our important suit with this great government. I have looked forward with much interest for a copy of your argument beforethe U. S. Supreme Court and did not receieve one until last evening. Being somewhatweary with business, I retired to rest, leaving the argument to be read in themorning; but I could not sleep, and at midnight I arose, lit my lamp, sat atthe table, and read your argument through. I became convinced, for the first time,that the U. S.

They represent that I told you to go ahead and sueBro Armstrong. Now I do not know as you understoodme. My view was that Bro. Armstrong would not compromiseand if any body had to be sued that Bro Armstrong should be thefirst: But the brethren say that Armstrong has not refusedto compromise.Now Brother Young, I still think that compromiseshould be tried before the law. The brethren say that thereare men in Farmer's Ward who are opposed to those in theCanyon and say they are not entitled to a drop of water, and 
 prejudice which has been heaped up against us, an unpopular people, in order tohave the decision of the Supreme Court of this Territory in confiscating ourproperty, both real and personal, confirmed by the U. S. Supreme Court.I never read a more forcible and unanswerable argument in my life uponany subject. It certainly will require something more than sophistry of un-principled men to override what iron bulwark of constitutional and fundamentallaw which you have placed before them. I cannot now believe that the SupremeCourt of the United States, the highest tribunal of the nation, after thoroughly considering your argument, will attempt to escheat and confiscate the real andpersonal property of the Latter-day Saints. If they do, I tremble for my country.My dear friend, I, in connection with my people, will feel under everlast-ing obligations to you for the great labor you have bestowed and the interestyou have taken in our welfare. It matters not what the decision of the SupremeCourt may be upon this question, it will not lessen the obligations that weare under to you. I feel that the Lord has inspired you in this work.I have a birthday party at my home, with a few friends, on Friday night,March 1st, the anniversary of my eighty-second birthday. It would have beenexceedingly gratifying to me if you could have made one of the party.My dear friend, I do not know that we shall ever meet again in the flesh;but as I am a great believer in meeting friends in the next world, I hope and

I was also much interested in the letter of your friend, Israel Coe. Iwas astonished at his writing, a man of his great age. In answering your ques-tions concerning Sidney Rigdon I will say, he was cut off from the church, andwas not a member of the church when he died; he did not deny the faith but tookthe ground that he had the right to lead the church, and refused to acknowledgethe Twelve Apostles and the constituted authorities of the church after the death of Joseph and therefore he was cut off the church. Now concerning yourquestion about the abolition of polygamy, I will send you a copy of my manifestowhich will explain all that I said upon the subject. Concerning what you sayabout "Leaves from my Journal" I will say, I wrote that little work for the ben-efit of our Sabbath School children, giving them a little history of my experi-ence during my travels, and I stated nothing in it but what was true. We have in Salt Lake City a grandsonof Grandfather Lot Thompson, he is here writing upthe city; he is the son of Cyrus Thompson. He and his wife attended with myfamily my last birth-day party, the first day of last March.I am certainly pleased to hear from you, not only as a relativebut from a man of great age, and one who has faith in God, and in His SonJesus Christ as the Savior of the world: also in the Gospel which He preached,as the plan of salvation for a fallen world.
