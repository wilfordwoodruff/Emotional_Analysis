great events of the last days esspecially of the literal

gathering of Israel. They say the Saints shall

gather from the East & from the West & that that

the North shall give up & the South Keep not back

This interesting day had now arived yea the 19th of Sept

1836 when some of the Saints of God in the South

I rode with them this first days travel as far as the

south fork of Mayfield whare we all camped for the

night After pitching our tents & taking supper I

assembled this small camp of Israel together at Br

Albert Pettys tent to address them for the last time

& after they were assembled I arose to address them

& although the rain desended in torrents so that we wer

e wet through a good tent yet my soul was vibrated

& fired with emotions & feeling of no ordinary nature

I endeavor'd to lay before them the worth & value of

the cause they were ingaged in & that they were the

first in fullfiling the Prophets who spake of the south

keeping not back & that it would be recorded upon

the archives of heaven to be read in the day of eternity

that they were the first fruits of the south who

had spread their tents for zion I also instructed

them about travling by the way they all covenanted

to give heed to Elder Boydstuns precepts as they

had chosen him as their leader When I closed I was

followed By Elders Boydstun, Cathcart, & Clapp who

spake in the spirit of God & with feeling of the deepest

interest When this edifying interview closed by our

kneeling & I addressed a throne of grace & implored

the mercy of God to rest upon the camp that they

might all reach zion in Peace distance of the day 8 miles
