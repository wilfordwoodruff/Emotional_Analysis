and come home with the first company
in the Spring I think [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1863|He]] will be better
satisfied to do that, than to come home
this fall. Well it seems that the [[Utah Territory|Utah]]
Judges have formed a platform for the
Elders to stand upon &amp; Decide whithch
they will do some God or Bad and
the Decision thy make will Decide
their Destiny for all time &amp; Eternity
when [[John Sharp|John Sharp]] went back on
his family his covenants his religion
&amp; his God It cast a gloom over the
minds of Many, but when Bishop
[[Hiram Bradley Clawson|Clawson]] chose Imprisonment instd
of Deserting his wives &amp; children Breaking
his covenants Denying his faith &amp; tes-
timony his God it sent a thrill of
Joy through the breasts of thousands
I would rather be shot Dead or
struck with lightning than to do
as Sharp &amp; others have done Give me
Imprisionment or give me Death
but dont ask me to disown &amp; Desert
my family break my Covenants—
