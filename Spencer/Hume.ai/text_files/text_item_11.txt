Pres Woodruff said the Savior declared that if we were not one
we are none of his. This people ought to be one &amp; be united. In the
Celestial Kingdom we shall find no disunion. He spoke of his
early experience in the church. He referred to the fervor of [[Oliver Cowdery|Oliver 
Cowdery]] at one time in bearing his testimony, but he went into
darkness as did others who raised up their hands against the
Prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph]]. He feared disunion in any part of the church. He
explained the benefits &amp; advantages of union &amp; faithfulness. He re-
ferred to the woeful condition of those who have once stood
high in the church &amp; afterwards apostatised. He spoke with
much anxiety for the welfare of the church &amp; the unification
of the people. He remarked that the signs of the times indicate
the coming of the Son of Man &amp; all the purposes of God will be 
accomplished in this dispensation. He related a dream in which
he saw the Prophet Joseph in the Spirit world where he found
all were in a hurry &amp; on questioning him as to this condition 
of things, he was informed by the Prophet that the time was so
short to make preparations for the coming of the Son of man that 
they must be in a hurry to get ready. He related some other 
interesting incidents arising in his experience. He exhorted the
Saints to get the Spirit of the Lord, for without it we are not
safe. He spoke of the love of the Priesthood that exists &amp; should
exist with the Saints &amp; the impropriety of mourning over the
death of a righteous man. He felt great anxiety for our young
men many of whom were going astray. He hoped the Sisters
would avail themselves of the blessings of the Association organized
for their benefit.
