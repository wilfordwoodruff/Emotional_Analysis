The question for you. Wherever the Eternal 
Everlasting and Holy Priesthood or its influence
Dwells there is Protection and salvation and
Nowhare Els. For the ritghts of the Priesthood are 
inseparably connected with the Heavens and the Heavens
can ownly be controlled upon the principles of righteousness
The Lord Revealed to [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]] the Prophet 
and said that Angels were standing in the Temple 
in Heaven holding in their hands sharp sickles and crying 
unto God dDay &amp; night saying let us go down and 
reap down the fields. But the Lord [said] unto them pluck not
up the tares while the Blade is yet tender Lest you 
destroy the wheat also wait untill the wheat is gathered 
and the tares bound in Bunddles then the field rem-
aineth to be burned I now bear testimony to this
Assembly that that day has come. These destroying
Angels are sent forth to visit the Earth and have 
commencd to poor out the Judgments of God 
upon the wicked and will continue untill the 
scene is wound up and all fulfilled that God 
has promised. Therefore Judgment awaits
the wicked. President [[George Quayle Cannon|Cannon]] followed and
bore his Testimony upon the same subject


See 86 section of D.C. 5 6 &amp; 7 verses. W Woodruff
Also Testified that the Prophet Joseph sealed upon 
the Heads of the Twelve Apostles All the Keys of the kingdom [of]
God that God had sealed upon him And commanded them 
to bear off the Kingdom of God or they would be Damed
