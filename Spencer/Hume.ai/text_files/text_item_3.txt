We regret that Brother [[John Willard Young|John W. Young]] should
feel as [[Joseph Fielding Smith|you]] describe. His expressions concerning being
left in the lurch or being crushed have no founda-
tion in fact. There has been no such disposition
manifested by the Committee towards him. We have
treated him with all the consideration and respect
that could be reasonably asked. Certainly we have 
tried to treat him with more courtesy than we think
we have received. If he will only reflect as he should
do, he will see that there has been no manifestation
on our part to do him the least injury, or to treat
him in any way that should displease an honorable
and upright man. The Committee certainly have ask-
ed no more from him than they themselves are
expected to perform. Money is placed in their
hands; but they will have to account for its expendi-
ture; and this is but reasonable. Confidence cannot be
maintained in any other way. We owe it to ourselves
and our future reputations that we should be able to 
render a strict account of all that passes through our
hands, so that no suspicion can arise as to our
