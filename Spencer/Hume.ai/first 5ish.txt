{[On] the [illegible] of Sister Martha Barker who desired to return back thinking it after all too great to leave her friends. I immediately

set before her the danger of returning to Babylon and encouraged her and she became reconciled and continued her journey.}

I rode with them this first days travel as far as the

south fork of Mayfield whare we all camped for the

night After pitching our tents & taking supper I

assembled this small camp of Israel together at Br

Albert Pettys tent to address them for the last time

& after they were assembled I arose to address them

& although the rain desended in torrents so that we wer

e wet through a good tent yet my soul was vibrated

& fired with emotions & feeling of no ordinary nature

I endeavor'd to lay before them the worth & value of

the cause they were ingaged in & that they were the

first in fullfiling the Prophets who spake of the south

keeping not back & that it would be recorded upon

the archives of heaven to be read in the day of eternity

that they were the first fruits of the south who

had spread their tents for zion I also instructed

them about travling by the way they all covenanted

to give heed to Elder Boydstuns precepts as they

had chosen him as their leader When I closed I was

followed By Elders Boydstun, Cathcart, & Clapp who

spake in the spirit of God & with feeling of the deepest

interest When this edifying interview closed by our

kneeling & I addressed a throne of grace & implored

the mercy of God to rest upon the camp that they

might all reach zion in Peace distance of the day 8 miles
