being seperated from them for 2 1/2 years & amoung

the rest I was filled with joy with the priviledg of

again meeting with Elder Warren Parrish & also being

made acquainted with his companion Sister Parrish. Ther

is an enjoyment in meeting our brethren & companions

in tribulations that the world knows not off because it

flows from a celestial source. After spending a short

time in conversing with my friends a more important

scene was now to open to my view than Kings ever

saw or Princes ever knew in this generation which

was to visit the Temple of the Lord & its contents

Elder Smoot & myself visited each appartment of the

House accompanied by Elder Parrish & I must confess

the scenery is indisscribable When I entered the

threshhold of the house & Passed into the lower room

their was great solemnity if not awe immediately overwh

elmed me I felt indeed as if my footsteps were in the

Temple of the Lord After walking into the Pulpets erected

for the Priesthoods & viewing the curtains all bespeaking

that grandure, solemnity & order that nothing short

of wisdom from God could invent. We then visited

the casket of the great work of Israels God in these

last Days as the Prophet exclaims he does things

we looked not for: Two & a half years since I left

Kirtland with my Brethren in their Poverty to go fourth

to visit our brethren in tribulation in zion then our

Brethren in Kirtland were poor, despised, & even looked

upon By the pomp of Babylon with disdain & disgrace

who stood waiting with eager eyes to behold them

sink into forgetfulness. But how changed the scene

now I behold a cheerfulness beaming upon every

countenance that indicates Prosperity & the noise

of the ax & the hammer & the sight of their walls &

dwellings newly erected & their Bank & market &

esspecially house of God speaks in language loud as

thunder that the saints will have a City in prosp

erity in spite of all the fals Prophets of Baal or

even earth or hell because God is with them &

his Temple stands in honor of his kingdom while

babylon begins to wonder & will soon perish

the accounts of my Journals & recorded the same in the

following manner. Thus ends the year of 1836 which

hath quickly passed with its report into ETERNITY





1st I Travled six thousand five hundred & fifty seven Miles 6,557











2nd I Held one hundred & fifty three Meetings 153





I attended four conferences 4





& Held four debates 4





^I Planted one Branch of the Church^





3rd I Baptized twenty seven Persons 27





^I confirmed 27^





4th I ordained two Elders, three Priests, one Teacher,

& two Deacons. 8





^I esstablished 2 prea[c]hing places^





5th I attended to the ordinance of blessing nineteen children, 19





6th Their was four Persons healed of deseases under my hands 4





7th I Procured twenty two subscribers for the M & Ad. 22.





I also Procured seventy Dollars for the M[essenger] & Ad[vocate]. $70.





8th I gave Six dollars & Procured eighty five more for

the building of the house of the Lord in Kirtland $91





9th I wrote thirty four Letters 34





& Receieved seven Letters 7





10th I had three mobs Come together against me

But always as yet deliverd from their hands. 3.



 END_ENTRY The before mentioned is an account of the most conspicuous 

part of my Procedings during the year of 1836 which has 

gone into eternity with its report as the year before it 

hath done & as the one following & all others must do. 

O time how swift & how precious thou art. How great 

the events that are bourn upon thy wings, esspecially 

in the dispensation of the fullness of times. 1836 is 

gone it cannot be recalled. Europe hath began to tremble 

at thy departure. The endowment of the Latter Day 

Saints hath b[e]spake a God in Israel, & is sufficient 

to show that though the heavens & earth pass away 

the word of God spake through the Prophets must 

all be fulfilled. It is true that the thoughts of man 

may now retrace his footsteps through 1836 that is 

Past. But who can tell whare the end of 1837 will 

leave him. Yea that important year that is 

mounting the wheels of time to stand upon the 

stage of exhistance, to do its Perfect work. Will 

not its gigantic operations, & its magnus works 

stand upon the Archieves of heaven as great events 

Will this gentile generation still sleep in this late 

hour, if so sleep on & take thy rest which is short 

for thy end is come, & the day hath broke that 

Israel must be awoke from his slumber for the last 

time & Prepare himself for the Bridegroom. Then let 

1837 finish its work with speed & let its departure 

Say who hath gone to the tomb & what Kingdom 

overturned & what Kingdom esstablished & may 

God grant that 1837 may report as she departs 

that zion & her stakes indicates that God rules 

in her midst with POWER STRENGTH & GLORY.





Thus ends the year of 

1836

My Dear Phebe



In the midst of my Fathers family I once

more take up my pen to convers with you a few moments. I have

delayed writing longer than I should but I have been waiting for a

letter from you I have had the greatest anxiety to hear from you

& Sarah E. & the friends around you but as yet I have not had that privilege

When I passed through Buffalo I sent to the Post Office by the Captain of the

boat that carried me to Albany & he found no letter there for me I am

in hope that I shall find one from you when I arive at New York for

I have great anxiety about you to know if you & the babe are

sick or well I have seen you twice since I left home (in dream) &

from what you told me the last time I did not know but you

was sick or had a poor turn but I hope mot at any rate I want

to hear from you. I have much I should be glad to say to you

at this time but I must be brief as Eunice will write some

on this sheet: you will wish to hear a word concering my journey

On the 21st Aug I left Rochester & the Island friends On the 24th I was

in Terre Haute spent 2 days there with Doct Modesett a Saint visited the buying [burying]

yard obtained much information concernig Asahel from a Mr Adams

On the 30th spent the night with the family of James Townsend

he had gone with a team from home they had all been sick with

the Ague & fever Sept 1st Sundy I preached to a congregation of

Germons Brother Taylor followed me while he was speaking I sat by

a window the wind blew upon me & I had a chill & fever that eveng I

had been gain[in]g in health untill that time I continued my journey in

the morning but the ague again left me I continued my journey to

Clevland by land at which place I arived on the tenth of Sept enjoying pretty

good health I took boat on Lake Erie on the 10th I noticed however END_ENTRY with peculiar feelings as I journied by land the places whare you suffered

with your sickness [Eunice's handwriting, Wilford's words] with regard to crossing the Lake, we had a very tedious time of it. were

caught in a line storm, and was in it 3 days on our way to Buffalo, at which place on the 13th we ^I^ took line

boat for Albany, arrived at Albany on the 19th. during which time in consequence of the cold I took on the Lake

with the crowded situation of the boat, caused a return of the chills and fever, which I had every day for

the last week of my journey. I took stage at Albany at 10 oclock at night, travell'd through the night, and

also the next day, and finally arrived at Avon about sunset. spent the night at Aunt Wheelers, the next

morn being the 21st of Sept. I arrived at Fathers house at Farmington, and had the happy privilege thro'

the blessing of God, of once more meeting Fathers household face to face, have now been at home about 10 days

and immediately on my return home as I began to be recruited from my journey, my health began to

amend, and did not have my turns of fever and ague, although I have felt the effects of it in some

degree from day to day, but I would here say that I have felt perfectly easy as regards the affliction of my

body feeling confident that I shall soon recover my usual health. and I would here say as before that I do

not wish you to give yourself an uneasiness as it regards my health, only give me your prayrs, and all will

be well. I would just also remark that I lacked nothing on my journey as it regards my temporal wants, and

had 50 cents left when I arrived at Fathers, and my purse is beginning to be replenished so that I shall

be enabled to continue my journey in a few days. since at home I have had an interview with most of the

Saints that belong to this small branch of the church. Uncle Ozem Woodruff, Sister Anna Cossitt brother Dwight—

Webster &c. were among the number, and I felt truly ^to^ rejoices before the Lord to find them firm in the faith

and holding fast whereunto they had attained, and determined to do the will of the Lord henceforth, and they

have a Zion spirit desiring to gather with the Saints. I would say that my Grand mother, Anna Thompson,

departed this life a day or two since. was buried yesterday. We have visited Uncle Adna Hart found him quite low

and to all appearance near the borders of the grave. as it regards the rest of our friends they are usually well,

I have not as yet heard from any of our friends in Scarborough, but I expect soon to see brother Ilus in

New York.



Give my respects to Sisters Young all the Saints in Commerce and Montrose from head to foot

inasmuch as you have an apportunity, tell brother Hawley that I have had an interview with

his brothere in law Mr Satler, he was very anxious to see him. I must now draw to a close

as Sister Eunice will fill the remainder of this sheet, b I hope I shall be gratified with a

Letter from you before I leave New York.



I still remain yours in the strongest ties,

Wilford Woodruff



[still in Eunice's handwriting]

Mrs Phebe Woodruff



N.B. I would here remark that I discovered your "petition" soon after leaving home and was highly

edified with the spirit thereof thereof and I pray God my heavenly Father at all times to answer

all such prayrs that may ascend in our behalf.

W. END_ENTRY Farmington Oct. 1st.



Dear Sister

As Willford has reserved for me a page to fill, I will now cheerfully (tho' in something of a hurry)

seat myself to pen you a few lines. I recieved your Letter at the hands of my brother and was truly glad to

hear from you, was sorry however to hear of the ill state of your health as also that of your family, but

how it will soon be improved. Wilford as you are aware is quite unwell, and we feel as you write, much

anxiety respecting him, as he is about to undertake such a journey. and it seems to me as tho' I could

not have him leave us so soon, but then, we know that God has called and said "Go", and

shall we worms of the dust say stay' Nay, but let us rather rejoice that he is accounted worthy

to become a messenger from God to the nations of the earth. but still my natural feelings at times

gain the ascendency and I can hardly reconcile myself to have him leave us. I need not say that

W. is a brother that I set much by of this you probably are aware. but as Asahel is gone, my

affections return with double force upon Willford. I place confidence in him as I formerly did

in Asahel, looking to him, as a friend and protector, I hope however I shall not forget that

my comforts and blessings flow from God, the bountiful giver of all good,



I suppose I shall have to be brief at this time, but I shall write you from time to ti[me] [page torn]

shall hope to hear from you often, and do give us a particular account of things an[d] [page torn]

with you, for we shall ever be glad to hear, and also as it respects the situation of the church.

I would ask no greater blessing than to be permitted to take up my residence with the Saints with the

Saints at the west, I would be willing to undergo ma[n]y earthly privations. I have felt as tho' I should

like it much could I be with you whilst W. is gone his mission, but I suppose it would not be

considered consistent at present. but I do feel as tho' I should be permitted e'er long, to stand on

Mount Zion with the blessed company. pray for me Sister, that I may live in such a manner

as to be accounted worthy to escape the just judgments of God abroad in the land, and finally

have a standing given me with the saints of God. I have been quite unwell most of the time since

W. has been at home and consequently have not received as much pleasure in hearing him converse upon

this Latter day work, as I otherwise should have done. but we have had a very pleasant with him, and

shall remember it with much pleasure. the greatest complaint I make is that I have not had scarcely

any apportunity of conversing with him myself. I hope the Lord will grant that he may have grace

given him to perform his mission acceptably. that the Lord would be with him and bless him

continually. grant him with the rest of the company a safe and pleasant journey over the waters

and when their mission is fill'd return them safe to the bosom of their friends.



My best wishes for the welfare of yourself and babe, I remain yours, Sister Eunice END_ENTRY Mrs

Frooms Hill in Herefordshire ^England^ 5 miles North of Ledbury 

on the 5th day of March 1840 & commenced preaching 

the word of God unto the people & many recieved my 

testimony & I commenced Baptizing such as should 

be saved & in one month & 5 days I Baptized Mr 

Thomas Kington the superintendant of the Church of 

the United Brethren which came out of the methodist

connextion & I also Baptized forty Eight Preachers of 

the United Brethren & 112 of the members making 

158, souls in all. This scenery flung into my hands or 

under my superintendancy & care 42 established 

places of preaching which were licensed according to 

law including one chapel. this has opened the largest 

field for labour & increase of numbers of any door 

that has been opened in the same length of time since 

the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has 

been esstablished. Their was among this number 

Baptized some of most all classes & churches, 46 

Preachers one clark of the Church of England, one 

constable & a number of wealthy farmers, & when 

I left this vast field of Labour to go to Preston 

to attend the conference their was nearly 200 

souls ready to be baptized as soon as an opportun

 END_ENTRY have again returned into this part of the vine

yard, & Elder B. Young is with me & I expect 

Elder Richards soon to assist in pruning this part 

of the vineyard. this field that is now open is 

about 40 miles from Bristol 40 from Birmingham 

& 120 from London. I expect the church will 

number several hundred in this region soon. I fou

nd on my return that Elder Kington had baptized 

10, & Priest John Cheese 20 making the whole No 

188 souls. mobs have arisen against me in some 

instances, on one occasion they stoned me while 

baptizing. see April 9th. I had vast congregat

tions attended my meetings & the country was 

all stired up, & many priest & people came out 

to hear what I had to say & many received 

my testimony. I feel thankful to God for all his 

mercy & kindness unto me & all the Saints in 

opening so many doors that the kingdom of God may 

roll forth that there may be a people prepared for 

the coming of Jesus Christ





Compare March 26th with April 18th



 END_ENTRY April 14, 1840 ~ Tuesday to April 16, 1840 ~ Thursday





Thus I spent the 14, 15, ^&^ 16 of April siting in coun

cil with my Brethen the Twelve & the Saints. I 

preached in the evening of the 15th, in the Tempera

nce Hall to a crouded congregation. I felt 

Happy to have the privilege of sitting in 

council with my Brethen the Twelve in 

a foreign Nation to do the work of the Lord

After our council closed on the 16th I walked 

with Elder Richards to Penworthham & spent

the night 2 miles





April 17, 1840 ~ Friday





17th This being good friday the quorum 

of the Twelve met at Penworthham to visit 

the saints & spend the day together before we parted. 

Sister Moon opened a bottle of wine for 

us to bless & partake of which she had kept for 

40 years. after spending the day in con[v]ersing 

about the things of the Kingdom of God we ret-

urned to Preston & spent the night 2 m





April 18, 1840 ~ Saturday





18th The time had come for the Twelve 

to seperate & go into different parts of the 

vineyard. It was thought wisdom for 

Elder Kimble to visit the churches that he 

had built up while in England, & that Orson 

Pratt go North & visit Scotland that



 END_ENTRY John Tayler commence his Labours in 

Liverpool, that P. P. Pratt go to Manchester

21st We took coach & rode to Dudley we had 

a plain view of the Old Dudly Castle which 

is on a hill North of Dudley the age of it no 

man knoweth but it is partly in ruins 

We rode to Worcester & spent Several hours



 END_ENTRY in this City. We visited the Ancient noted splended 

Worcester Cathedral Which surpasses any thing for spel 

splender & architecture mine eyes ever beheld

it was about 400 feet in length 800 or 900 

years of age it contained many Monuments or

portraits of persons which were graven out of marble 

& lade over the tombs or vaults of Ancient Bishops, 

Lords, & Princis, some of which had lane there for 

7 or 800 years. It is said that some of these mon

uments with their winding st[r]eets which are carved 

out of fine marble is as neatly executed as 

any thing found in Europe. almost evry thing about 

this cathedral from top to bottom is carved out of 

solid marble the whole pulpit is carved out of 

one solid stone. There was a large Organ 

in the building. The Church of England still 

worship in this building, they hold a time of 

worship twice each day in a year, we stayed there

one service. The whole concern is superior 

to the architecture of the present generation.

from Worcester we rode to Ledbury & on the 

ride we passed through the Town of Malvern on 

Malvern Hill the most Noted Hills in England in 

consequence of they being the highest & the



 END_ENTRY most splended prospect of all the surrounging 

country for 30 miles, & on some of the highest 

peaks are large intrenchments whare men 

retreated to in the time of the roman war, 

The buildings in the village of Malvern are 

splendid standing on the side of these Hills. 

It has long been a place of retreat for 

the Kings Queens princis Lords & Noblemen 

of London & other parts of England to visit 

in the summer season. We had a view 

of eastner castle as we past along. We spent 

the night at Mr Francis Pullins in Ledbury 51 m

May 11, 1840 ~ Monday





11th A visit on the Herefordshire Beacon 

which is the South part of Malvern Hill

After having my mind prepared for a lonely walk & medi

tation by reading P. P. Pratts remarks upon the "eternal duration 

of matter", I commenced assending this noted hill upon the

south side of it & after arising several hundred feet I came

to the top of an old ancient intrenchment about one mile 

in length reaching round all of this part of the hill & meeting



 END_ENTRY together. then after rising another hundred feet I entered

another Intrenchment like the one below & after this 

another & thus Intrenchment lay above Intrenchment 

untill we ^I^ reached the top of the hill which was nearly flat 

or level & lay in a circle or round & not being more 

than one or two acres on the top & thus I stood upon the 

top of this Bacon or hill from 10 to 1500 feet in highth 

& while surveighing the surrounding Country I could also

behold the deep Intrenchments below me which it is 

supposed were flung up nearly a thousand years since & 

was capable of holding hunderds of thousands of persons 

which was the resort of the romans in the times of their 

wars, these hills are alltogether bare without timber but

covered with grass which is grazed by sheep & asses; several

acres on the S.W. side is covered with rabit burrows whil 

scores of rabits are running about upon the ground. but I 

soon drew my thoughts from the busy rabit, sheep, & asses

to the solumn reflections which the ravages of time presen

ted before me. O! Malvern thy lofty Hill bares up my feet

while mine eyes take a survey of thy deep intrenchments thy

mighty bulwarks ^which have^ trembled by the roar of cannon, the 

clash of arms, & din of war has reeched around thy brow 

& died away in the vale beneath, while the blood of

many a roman & Englishman to, have washed thy brow & soaked

thy soil while they have fallen to rise no more they sleep

in death & time has earth'd them all & they are forgotten 

& blotted from the history & memory of man. Notwithst

anding O! Malvern thou hast been the Ark or refuge for thousands 

in the time of trouble or war, yet Willford is the ownly

solitary soul that treads thy soil this day & he alone bends his 

knee upon on the highth of thy summet in the midst of the clouds 

to offer up the gratitude of his heart unto that God who will 

soon level all hills exhalt all valies & redeem the earth

from the curse of sin & prepare it for the abode of the

Saints of the MOST HIGH. I retired from the hill into 

the vale reflecting upon the rise, progress, decline, & fall of the 

empires of the earth, & the revolutions which must still

transpire before the winding up scene & the comeing of Christ





I preached at candle light at Brother John Allard at wind point

& had the spirit of God & Baptized 4 & confirmed them

I spent the night at Mr Joseph Symons distance 5 mil





May 12, 1840 ~ Tuesday





12th A member of the Weslian Methodist Church came 

to me to inquire what she should do to be saved I told her

she must be born of the water & spirit, repent & be paptized

for the remission of sins. she received my testimony & 

wished me to baptize her, I also called upon a woman that

tended the gate at Chancys pitch & preached the word unto her

B Young, H. C. Kimball, O Pratt, W. Richards, W. 

Woodruff J. Taylor & G. A. Smith of the Twelve 

R. Hedlock High priest 120 Saints, 160 of the world

1 carpenter, 1 cook 2 stewards making 307 souls in 

all, we took the parting hand with Elders P. P. Pratt 

& O. Hide & a multitude of Saints who stood upon 

the dock or quay to see us start END_ENTRY We drew out into the river Mercy & cast anchor in sight 

of Liverpool & spent the day & night. It was with some 

difficulty that we could get the baggage stowed away 

so that we could make our beds however we lay dow

n & slep well



April 21, 1841 ~ Wednesday





21st Wednesday the wind is favorable & we are all 

vary busy in nailing down & lashing our baggage to 

prepare for sea. The anchor was hauled up & sails 

spread at 12 oclock & started on our voyage, ** we had 

a good breeze through the day but most all the passengers 

were sea sick & stacked up in heaps & vomiting at a 

dreadful rate. We had a room built for our quorum 

in the second cabin, the second cabin was mostly 

occupied by the Saints the steerage by other passe

ngers. Fare was £3.15 we were allowed the privilege 

of the Aft quarter deck. The Rochester is a fast 

sailing vessel vessel of about 1,000 tons we passed by 

all the ships that went out of Liverpool at the time 

we did, among the number was the Oxford of the line 

the one that we sailed to England in in 1840



April 22, 1841 ~ Thursday





22nd We arose quite weak by vomiting & sickness

it is a plesent morning we are nearly out of sight of land 

but 10 sail are in sight of us I went among the 

sick passengers & got them out of their births on deck 

to take the air. Elder G.A. Smith was quite sick with 

a severe cough through the night



April 23, 1841 ~ Friday





23rd Cloudy & some rain contrary winds



April 24, 1841 ~ Saturday





24th It commenced at midnight to blow a gale all 

head wind. it blew away our fore topsail, we were 

all dredful sea sick I could not get out of my 

births all day it was a distressing time to us all



April 25, 1841 ~ Sunday





25th Sea mountains high head winds ship rocking 

& pitching dreadfully all sea sick I spent 

some of the day on deck I was faint, I ownly 

eat two backed potatoes in two days & that I 

soon vomited up I spent a sick night which was the 

case with most of us Sunday



April 26, 1841 ~ Monday





26th Monday we got a little food in our stomacks 

& got on deck vary feeble in body I never felt END_ENTRY worse in any sickness, was thankful that my 

wife & children was not with me to share in such 

sufferings, the sun is plesent today we have 

still west head winds & rough sea. Their has 

been some fears that several children would 

die on board being vary sick, we got together 

& prayed the Lord to have mercy upon us all & 

spare the lives of our company, & the sick began 

to amend truly we have perils by sea as well 

as by land [FIGURE] Two years ago this day the 

Twelve held ther Conference on the building 

spop of the house of the Lord in the city far 

west on which occasion I was ordained to the 

quorum of the Twelve in company with G.A. Smith 

& we started on that day to take our foreign missi

on & thank God we are now on our return home 

& are still alive & through the mercy of God are 

like to live. ** we had a still night



April 27, 1841 ~ Tuesday





27th Wind [FIGURE] W still blows the Saints are some 

better the Twelve are generally well & vary patie

nt well united & agree in all things & love one 

another, I visited the sick & got them on deck



April 28, 1841 ~ Wednesday





28th This was a day that caused many mixed 

sensations of pleasure & pain grandure & solemnity 

hope & fear to many. To me it was a day that satisfy

ed mine eyse in many respects. when we arose 

in the morning we still found strong head winds 

which soon increased to a great storm & tempest 

which scenery I have not language to describe the 

sails were close reefed or taken in as soon as pos-

sible, it took 16 men to cloose reef the main top sail 

the tempest was now raging with all power the 

sea piling up into mountains, the ship mountain the 

waves & billows & pitching into the valleys & rocking 

tremendiously & shiping seas occasionly, in the midst 

of this seenery the cry of help was herd in our 

cabin I rushed to the scene & found the ropes giving 

way & breaking which held the whole mass of baggage 

which was piled up between decks, consisting of 

heavy trunks, chests, boxes & barrels which if once 

liberated from their confinement would with one END_ENTRY surge be hurled with all their force into the births 

of the men, women, & children which would endanger 

the lives of all on seeing the foundation of this mass 

give way Elder W. Richards & myself sprang to 

this place of danger & braced ourselves against the 

barrels & held them for a few moments untill it 

was a little secured I then went on deck to the 

Captain & informed him of the situation of things 

below & he sent the sailors with some ropes & secured 

the pile which was endangering the lives of many 

After this was done I again repaired to the Aft quarter 

deck to behold the raging of the tempest & the wonders 

of the deep & the movements of the ship which was the 

greatest scenery I ever beheld upon the water 

Elde[r]s Young, Kimball, Richards & Smith was with 

me on deck for a time but all had now gone below 

except Elder Richards & myself & the officers & 

crew, we were shiping heavy seas it was now 

about sun set I stood in the middle of the aft quarter 

deck holding the Captains speaking trumpet in one 

hand & holding to a fast bench with the other when 

we shipped a tremendious sea on the windward 

side of us which passed clear over the quarter deck 

on which I stood. On seeing that we could not esca-

pe it Elder Richards flung himself close under the 

Bulwarks & the body of the wave went clear over 

him without wetting him but little but as I could 

not take the same advantage I flung myself 

upon the deck & held upon the fast seat whare I 

remained untill the sea passed over me & left me 

drenched in the surge I now thought it time for 

me to leave my seat of observation for the day 

& go below as I was thoroughly wet with salt water

I went to bed but did not sleep but little for 

the ship rocked at a dredful rate boxes, barrels, 

& tines were tumbling from one end of the 

cabin to the other. And in the steerage about 15 

Births were flung down 9 at one surge with 

all the men women & children flung into a pile in 

the midst of the berths but no lives lost or bones 

broken. This is the 8th day in succession that we 

have had strong headwind END_ENTRY April 29, 1841 ~ Thursday





April 29th Sea vary rough after the gale 

the sun shines plesent. & we have a fair wind 

for the first time since we left Liverpool 

we sail 10 nots an hour their is one sail in sight 

of us. A plesemt evening wind aft nearly all the 

canvass spread I had a good nights rest



April 30, 1841 ~ Friday





30th A fine breeze from NE sail 10 not an hour 

fears were entertained that the ship was on fire 

as smoke arose from the holes but it was found 

to come from the cook shop. I was requested 

to carry the dishes to the cook so I got my hands 

full of dishes of various kinds & just as I steped 

to the door of the cook house the ship gave a 

dredful surge & rocked so that she lay upon her 

side with her stud sails in the water this 

unexpected surge plunged me head foremost about 

10 feet the whole bredth of the cook shop against 

the side of the cook room with the cook [on] top of me

As this was my first introduction to the cook 

since I had been at sea I begged his pardon for 

such an adrupt enterance, & withdrew leaving 

the cook with three smashed fingers (caused by

trying to save me in the fall) to pick up my 

dishes at leasure which were scattered from one end to 

the other of the ship his shop I hope it will be 

a long time before I shall pay the cook a similar 

visit. We sail exeeding fine & have now for 

3 days the passengers are over their sea sickness &

feel cheerful



May 1, 1841 ~ Saturday





May 1st A fine beautiful plesent mays mor-

ning. a fair NE wind or light breeze water smooth

in order to make out a correct entry when he arives in 

port



May 5, 1841 ~ Wednesday





5th We have a warm plesent morning but almost a dead 

calm we sail about 2 not an hour they sounded

of porposes to the north of us. Elder Peter Maughan 

lost a child this morning 6 weeks old, his wife died 

a short time before he set sail the body of this child 

was committed to a watery grave by sewing it up in 

a cloth tying a stone to it & sinking it in the sea on 

the banks of Newfoundland in Lat 42.25 Long 50.10 

we had a vary chilly fog in the evening

are in Lattitude 42 Long 55 making 3 hours 28 min 

from Liverpool making 945 miles still to sail to 

New York 810 geographical miles. A vary hard storm 

arose in the evening from the S.W. the sails were 

taken in the Heavens gatherd blackness, the sea rolled 

into mountains, & the Captain looked wild, in the 

midst of this their was a fight between the cook & 

the Irish, which was stoped by the first mate END_ENTRY who interfered we had the roughest night at 

sea which we have seen since we have been on 

the voyage the spars & other things were afloat on 

the main deck



May 8, 1841 ~ Saturday





8th fair weather but high head winds from the 

S.W. sea rough we shiped some heavy seas, one 

sail in sight, the Captain had his hat blown 

into the sea while taking observations with his 

quadrant we have passed two sail to day, I had a 

long conversation with the second mate in the evening 

whose name was Steward he gave me a rehearsal of 

his sea fareing life for 20 years which was interesting 

he had sailed twice around the world been within 

14 degrees of the South pole, had had his vessel blockad-

ed by floating mountains of Ice nearly a mile high 

for many days, which Ice burges freequently come 

in contack with each other which makes a report 

like an earthquake or peels of thunder he has crossed 

the pacific several times visited the East Indies & 

China & says in all his sailing he has never found a wors 

sea or ocean for stormes than the Atlantic, ie the 

Liverpool & New York trade after conversing several 

hours I retired to my berth & had a good nights rest



May 9, 1841 ~ Sunday





9th Sunday strong N wind vary cold sail 12 

not an hour towards New York the coldest day we 

had on the voyage, the wind went down 

with the sun I walked the deck in the evening 

with O Pratt & conversed about many things 

among which was the subject of the death of Elder 

David W. Patten & writing a history of his life 

we are within 15 degrees of Long of New York



May 10, 1841 ~ Monday





10th A fine plesent morning but a calm, we paid 

our cook bill to day which was £0.10 half a 

sovreign each. I paid Elder Young £1.10 And Elder 

Kimball £2.8 shillings which made a settlement of 

all our affairs, Elders Kimball O. Pratt & myself 

undertook to climb the riging of the ship. Elders 

Kimball & O. Pratt went up to the round top of the 

mainmast about 50 feet & returned I clumb 

over the round top & went up to the main top END_ENTRY gallant sail about 100 feet from the upper deck 

which was the top of the rope ladders I could go no 

higher without climing a single bear rope so I retu-

rned to the deck I found it required some presens 

of mind & caution to go up & down the riging of a ship 

as she was waving in the air we had a calm night



May 11, 1841 ~ Tuesday





11th A strong west head wind but warm we sail

passed by a ship this morning Ho!!! Ho!!! Capt

17th A strong W. head wind run 8 not an hour 

to the N.W. we are now gitting into great danger 

of the shoals & bottoms as wind is against us we 

can ownly about hold our own. the sea is much 

choped this morning appears some like Lake Erie 

We came in full view of Long Island at about 3

Leaward of us raised her flag & made for the pilot 

boat we took our pilot on board at 4 oclock we soon 

came in sight of 5 sail we kept in sight of Long Island 

during the evening. Our pilot informed us that 

he had not herd from the Oxford or any ship that 

Left Liverpool at the time we did & even for sever

al days before, so we had made the best voyage of 

any at this time of sailing he had not herd from 

the steem ship President but expected she was 

Lost. wind went down in the evening



May 18, 1841 ~ Tuesday





18th A strong N.W. wind sail 9 not an hour 

No land in sight I had the perusal of a New York 

Paper which informed us of the death of 

General Harrison President of the U.S.A. he Died 

on the 4th April 1841 Just a month after taking the 

Presidential Chair this is the first President that has 

Died in the U.S.A. while filling that office. 

We came in full view of the Jersey shore & 10 or 15 sail 

in the afternoon I felt to rejoice to once more behold the 

America shore my native country after being absent from 

it 16 months we had a view of Barnagar Lighthouse as 

we passed along



May 19, 1841 ~ Wednesday





19th I went on deck at 4 oclock in the morning to seee 

them go through we had head wind & had to beat thro

ugh which made it dangerous we passed through the 

hook, run into a fishing smack came near sinking her 

with all on board we had a view of the horse shoe and 

all the light houses as we passed along we saw 50 

fishing smack waiting for bait we raised our flag 

on the top of the mainmast having head wind we could 

not run in we got within 4 miles of the quarentene grou

nd & cast anchor at 11 oclock. A steem boat 

came along side & took the Liverpool papers containing END_ENTRY the latest news. The Editor Paid $45 dollars 

for the steem boat to bring him down to the ship 

to get the news we have been 29 days from Liver-

pool to our casting anchor this morning, we raised 

our anchor in the afternoon & went in with the 

tide on to the quarentene ground & again droped 

our anchor the physician came on board searched 

the passengers & found them well, But we shall 

be quarrenteened untill tomorrow now is the time 

we need much patience & long suffering in bearing 

one with another in taking out our baggage going

New York. the Captain went on shore at night



May 20, 1841 ~ Thursday





20th Warm plesent weather we commenced early 

in the morning getting our baggage on deck 

passengers went to washing & cleaning up it was 

a vary busy time, their was a fight between 

the carpenter & second mate which was ended 

by the first mate who brused the carpenters 

Head badly by striking him with a junk bottle.

Two quarentene lighters came along side of the 

Rochester & took off all the passengers & baggage & 

took us all to the Custom House here we had to 

unload all the baggage which were examined by 

the Custom House officer & out of 300 passengers 

we were not charged duty for the first article. We 

had to load evry thing again on board of the lighters 

who took us to New York City, & when we arived 

at the docks we found them coverd with horses 

& drays & about 50 drayman who stood ready to 

leap on board & devour all our baggage & bcause 

we were not willing to have our things stolen 

from us & be defrauded out of our rights 

but felt disposed to do our own busines without 

being forced to measures by carman, they cursed 

& swore at a dreadful rate & appeared more like 

cannibals than civilized men, but after much 

trouble & difficulty we got our goods out of the 

lighters & loaded them on to drays & constantly 

had to keep a guard over them to keep them from 

being stolen we were untill 10 oclock at night gett

ing of[f] the docks to an Inn, whare we spent the END_ENTRY April 6, 1844 ~ Saturday





A Special Conference held at Nauvoo 

April 6th AD 1844





Conference assembled at 10 oclock AM April 6 

President B, Young, called the conference to 

order. President Joseph Smith said he should 

not occupy time in speaking of any difficulties 

that might have occured in our midst, 

said he was not a fallen prophet, & never in 

any nearer relationship to God than at the 

present time, & would show before the conferen 

closed that God was with him. Prayer by 

W. W. Phelps, after which Sidney Rigdon 

arose & said it was with no ordinary feelings 

he arose to speak, a privilege which he had 

not before enjoyed in the same capacity for 

five years, and the circumstances of the 

occasion points out to me my text which is 

the saints of the last Days. I remember in 

1830 all the church met in a log cabin, whare 

we conversed extensively about laying the 

foundation of this kingdom, our minds 

expanded far & wide while contemplating 

this subject even in that day we talked 

as large then as now, we spoke of Great things 

that the world could not bear & that is 

the reason why we were in secret the world 

would laugh & consider us fools & even mob 

us becaus we talked about things that wer true 

& have and will come to pass yet things that 

looked impossible to them because they did 

not view them by faith as we do, and if we 

should still convers about things in secret it 

would be upon the same principle for we



 END_ENTRY are not willing to bear the scoffs of the world 

any longer unnessarily had we told openly 

& talked openly of the things of God that have 

& will come to pass our blood would have 

been shed we should not have been here 

this day. But we hid ourselves up in secret, 

there we talked wept, & prayed & the Angels 

Administered unto us & the spirit of God was 

with us & the heavens opened unto us, but we 

should now have been in our grave had we 

proclaimed unto the world what God showed 

unto us, notwithstanding it was for the benef-

it of man, & for his salvation, & not for evil

The appearance of this congregation this day 

shows the fulfillment of the revelations of 

Jesus Christ given in those days. No incident has 

taken place in this day but what we spoke

of at that early period, all those things were 

deeply impressed upon the mind by the God of 

Heaven. How could you be made to believe tha[t] 

you did not live in Nauvoo & have not got habit-

ations. Neither could we disbelieve this to be the 

Church of God, we cannot disbelieve it for we 

see hear & feel. I have always known it to be 

I cannot see otherwise. Have I not seen Gods 

glory by the visions of heaven yea I have then 

what have we to do with the little difficulties 

on earth nothing. Those were the beginning 

of Good days shut up in a little shop with 

nothing to eat but a little Jonnycake & milk & water 

ownly as we would occasionlly shoot a squirrel 

& we lived in an old smokey house, still we 

rejoiced in the things God was revealing unto 

us: many think it hard to live in Nauvoo but 

we counted those good days God had given



 END_ENTRY us great things, dont think strange if 

men dont think of great things when I 

obtained a great & glorious principle I felt 

like locking it up lest the people would laugh 

at me. And while we were together & telling 

one thing we would learn another; I speak

of these things to do away with the notion 

or feelings about our secret meetings 

was their any thing wrong then no, neither 

will their be now. No, I have no fear of it

what God does is for my salvation & the 

salvation of man, & I say go ahead.

I have spoken of the grand principle of 

the beginning, & I have marvelled at 

one thing ie after the foundation of the 

church men crept in that were vary 

wise more so than God professed to know, 

more some of them, it has kept the church 

in a continual broil, it was so in the days 

of Moses but he disposed of them he killed 

them or the Lord destroyed them.



 

I will leave this subject & show why 

salvation belongs to the Priesthood of God 

& why it belongs to us as a people. Men 

labor under a mistake ie salvation is distinct 

from goverment, salvation is always the 

result of goverment evry man has a right to 

govern himself in a goverment, as evry good 

is a part of the goverment & the laws is for 

the defence of a man, we see the need 

of laws in this city for their is evil [to] dispose of 

here. I have seen some trials in this city 

what some persons were tried for insulting 

the Marshall, but any other man is as good as



 END_ENTRY the Marshall, many other usful remarks 

were made by the speaker, when he gave 

way untill the Afternoon 





Was followed with many usful remarks 

from Elder Taylor. The stand was occupied 

with with eleven Lamanites chiefs braves &c





At 2 oclok the conference Assembled & 

resumed his subject & said we were discusing 

in the morning service upon the history of 

the Church of Jesus Christ. its a miserable man 

that could not manufactor his own tex[t]. I have 

known many a sermon spoiled by a bad tex

The Church of Jesus Christ then. The Hights 

of testimony, & amount of evidence that many 

of those have had that have fallen away, has 

been of such a nature that when they say 

they dont believe this work to be true they 

lie. The things that were done in secret 

in the begining are now seen openly and 

their is nothing secret now but what all 

will know in time to come, I am aware 

their is many things I did not hint at I will 

speak of them now. I have seen the time 

when the Presidency of the Church sitting 

now before me were locked up with me in 

secret places waiting upon God we did not 

go out at all but to eat &c But it was soon 

found out, & a mob came, saying God damn 

you to Hell, & threatened our lives, it was at this 

time we sat for hours sin the Visions of heaven 

around the throne of God & gazed upon the 

scenes of Eternity. one evening a Mexican 

called upon us & he went out armed to see



 END_ENTRY to see a dozen armed men in the cornor 

of the fence, he wanted to shoot them, after-

wards the mob came in & broke the door, took 

me & dragd me out through the streets by my 

heels with my head pounding over the frozen 

ground. Another company took presiden 

Smith, & tar & feathered him, they tried to

tar and turn Aquiphertos [aqua fortis] down our our throats 

this is the reason why we were in secret, 

under lock & key. Now if you will let us 

work openly we will not work in secret

we will work openly as much as you want. 

I think I have said enough already to show 

that the church has come up through great 

tribulation, let this suffice then upon this 

subject. Their is men standing in your midst 

who are not afraid of men or devels & 

men whos mouths cannot be stoped unless 

you take their lives for they will speak 

in defence of the innocent of virtue & truth 

while they live, their is men in your midst 

who have learned their is a great God who 

can do as he pleases take up the Hills as a 

little thing, & such men do not fear 

death, they know about heaven they have 

seen it & know all about it, their is men 

in your midst which you must sustain or 

go to Hell, save them & you save yourselves 

reject them & you go to Hell. We are 14 

years of age now chuse your guardeen 

and when you get to be 21, then do business 

for youselves you can save yourselves or 

Damn yourselves you have just men among 

you & the reason is because God has taught



 END_ENTRY them chose & ordained them & this is the

reason why they are so. you have men in your

midst who will not turn to the right hand or left

if you are in their path you must get out

you cannot cort by favor or welth or any

thing els, they do not ask Poleticians kings

or people for favor, they ask God for it alone

if the world make them rich or poor they

never ask for it. The man whom God has

raised up to lay the foundation of this work

is placed in such a situation that he cannot

fall and He is so lovely that I cannot get

mad at him. This is an important part

in the History of the Church, the cry of some

is I shall not get office if these men are not

put down, well God intended to keep them

fearing when God sets up his kingdom

he will sustain it above all laws & kingdoms

of the world & the world has no power

over the kingdom of God, the laws will

be so strict that the world will make to

try to ketch the saints that it will hang

themselves by the wholesale. we want to

build up the Laws of God in Hancock Co. I

dont care any thing about all the laws in

the world for I will live above them, God

teaches his servants to respects kings Gov

Presidents, & men in authority. But I have a

right to proclaim myself a king and priest

unto the most High God, yet I will not transgress 

your laws, but dont do as they did in

Missouri kill people because they would not bre

break the law. I dont want any office in

this goverment for I am determined to be

a king in the kingdom of God, what be



 END_ENTRY king in heaven and quarrel about the

office of constable on earth. The kingdom

of God may rise up in the midst of the kingd

of the world and live above all laws, and not

be a law abiding man, I will live above all law

I will pay my taxes & obey all requirments

that the goverment has uppon me. the

reason we was mob in Mo was because we

would not have any thing to do with the

laws we did not break any we lived above

them so they sent a mob upon us.

The kingdom of God to the world would

be a light in a dark place. The kingdom

of God could be set up in any kingdom

or country & not break the law but live

above it. conference Adjourned till to

morrow morning





April 7, 1844 ~ Sunday





April 7th Sunday the sun plesent air

calm & serene & a vast multitude of about

twenty thousand souls assembled together

after singing and prayers President Rigdon

arose & said, Our borders are enlarged

this morning. I shall preach from the

same tex we preached from yesterday

The Church of Jesus Christ, the Kingdom

of God, the leven, the little stone spoken

of by Daniel &c. The testimony given would

let the kingdom of God exhist in any goverment

Monarchiel or Republican. We intend to show

why salvation belongs to this Church ownly.

The kingdom of God is a goverment

that exerciseing its ownly power in evry

respect its ownly it holds a place on the



 END_ENTRY mind, not by force of Arms, but by

free will because they want to do the will

of God & it is accomplished by truth

itself that is manifest from Heaven

by intelligence that he sees in heaven and

it is power in itself it is on this principle

that power rests the Lord begins to teach a

man what he can do and if he never would

know what he was taught he never would

know what he could do. No people can com-

prehend it but the Church of God, then one

of the main things in the kingdom of God

is to let a man know what to do, what glory

kingdom & power he can gain, man is taught

a principle that when it enters the mind it

has a power over death, plagues, sickness, the

gift of miracles, this is one great eviden

of the work the power of God, this then is

the kingdom of God. All religions then

that there is in the world that has not these

things has a tendency to do hurt instead of

doing good for it teaches those things are done

away. God has said he would take all the

kingdoms of the world out of the way, he would

Break in peases & subdue & he would teach the

kings and all powers the way that they may

have a chance. We say then their is no

power any whare els unto salvation. Isaiah said

the wilderness should blossom as the rose the

lame leap, the blind see, we have got this power

here yet the world says it is an imposition.

when he comes, He will save you, the lame shall

leap, Deaf hear, Blind see, he will come so you need

not have sickness or lameness, Man ^But^ man has proclaimed

salvation in the earth, when we exercise the



 END_ENTRY the keys of the kingdom of God who can oppose it

not war with the sword but with another

power, the world has always been sheding

Blood. I proclaim peace not war, & this is what

he calls the kingdom. Has not the kingdom

of God a right to extend in any part of the world

to do good. Beat swords into plow shares &

spears into pruning hooks, & it shall be a kingdom

of glory, peace, ^&^ salvation. Let no man be alarmed

because the Lord said that the kingdom of God

should swallow up all other kingdoms what harm

would it do for all the world would have the

same spirit, the Lord said he intended to do

by the whole world the same as he has done

by us, & this is the thing the world is afraid

of, reflect then. This is as far as I intended

to go upon this subject, A word then upon

the Materials to carry on this kingdom. Any

man Publicans, sinners, scoundrals or any body

els could repent & receive the gospel & become a

member of the kingdom as well as the good for

when Jesus came he came to call sinners & Harlots

came into the kingdom. It dont requir

much of an exhertion of the mind, much

depends however upon the decision of the

mind, it depends upon one action of the mind

A man remarked to me He did not belong

to a church was not worthy, but this is a

mistake. Jesus Christ came to save sinners

He saves the unworthy. The Lord will offer

a man salvation he says he is not worth,

but what would you want your son to do

if he was unworthy. He should return to his 

father, so with God. He calls to the world

to return by Baptism. He cannot make him

self any better, but decid with the mind



 END_ENTRY today then the Lord begins to teach him the

the things of God & heaven & I will make you

like myself. I will give you my spirit &

make you feel like my family, & this is the 

pivot to a God then decide & go & be Baptized

then you will be in the way of salvation, if

he decide otherwise he will not be any better.

A word upon the spirit, this noble decision of the

mind causes angels to rejoice in the Heavens

for their is more joy over one sinner that

repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons

evry person can do this & no man can do a

better work, let no man say they are

unworthy. I wish all the teachers of the day

could hear me. I was a Baptist & preached

their doctrin & was hampered, & hampered

others in my teachings and all the teachers

of the day do the same. they may be honest

but they teach fals doctrins, they call people

to the anxious bench & keep them down

untill they will say they are willing to be damned

But I never was willing to be damned, the

doctrin Peter taught was different from

sectarianisms. His doctrin was repent & be Baptized

& you shall receive the Holy ghost, take a view

of this subject look at the spirit of promise, view

the congregation on that day they were stranger

not having a knowledge of salvation they were

strangers to the power of God & did not know 

that Jesus Christ was crusified & all they

knew about it was what Peter told them on

the day of Pentecost, 14 vrs of 2 ch of Acts

the ownly knowledge they had about the

Holy Spirit was what Peter taught them by

quoting the prophet Joel 37 ver now mark this



 END_ENTRY Peter had defined the spirit of God of the fruits

of it be Prophecy, dreams, visions, revelations

&c yes this is the spirit of God the spirit of

Prophecy, dreams, visions, heal the sick, & all the

great things, & I will in the last days pour out

my spirit upon all flesh. this is the definition

of the Spirit. All were called to be baptized

without any exceptions, villians Harlots Scoundrel

and all. A question, how long would it take

the sectarian religion before they would prophe[s]y

& have the gifts of the spirits of God, it would

take seven eternities to do it for it is on a

different scheme. I will come to an Anxious

bench and get as good a convertion as can be

got at an anxious bench, will I be converted

to Gods? No, I will be converted to an anxious

bench. If I had been converted to God I

should have been Prophesying According to

the words of Joel, for He said the spirit of

God should be poured out upon all flesh &

I believe I am flesh & I believe you are

flesh & I believe we are in the last days,

I will now sum up the testimony, what is

a man to preach when they go out, tell the

people to repent quit their iniquity be Baptized

& you shall recieve the Holy ghost, dream

dreams, see visions, & prophecy & if they

dont tell them this they preach another

gospel.



 END_ENTRY 3 oclok PM April Sunday 7th 1844

[FIGURE] The following important edefying & interest-

ing discourse was delivered by President.

Joseph Smith to about twenty thousand souls

upon the subject of the death of Elder King Follet





I now call the attention of this congregation

while I addres you upon the subject of the dead

The case of our Beloved Brother King Follet who

was crushed to death in a well as well as many

others who have lost friends will be had in mind

this afternoon & shall speak upon the subject

in general as far as I shall be inspired by the

Holy spirit to treat upon the subject. I want 

the Prayers & faith of the saints that I may

have the Holy Ghost, that the testimony may

carry conviction to your minds of the truth

of what I shall say, & pray that the Lord may

strengthen my lungs, there is strength here 

your prayers will be herd. Before I enter upon

an investigation of this subject, I wish to

pave the way, and bring up the subject from

the beginning that you may understand. I

do not intend to please you with oritory but with

the simple truths of heaven Edify you.

Go to the morn of creation to understand of

the decrees of the Eloheem at the creation.

It is necessary for us to have an understanding

of God at the beginning, if we get a good start

first we can go right, but if you start wrong you

may go wrong. But few understand the character

of God. they do not know they do not understand

their relationship to God. the world know no more

than the brute beast, & they know no more than



 END_ENTRY to eat drink and sleep & this is all man knows 

about God or his exhistance, except what is given 

by the inspiration of the Almighty. go then to 

the beginning that you may understand. I ask

this congregation what kind of a being is God? 

turn your thoughts in your hearts, & say have any 

of you seen or herd him or communed with him 

this is a question that may occupy your attention

The scriptures inform us that this is eternal life 

to know the ownly wise God & Jesus Christ whome 

He has sent.



 

If any inquire what kind of a 

being God is I would say If you dont know God 

you have not eternal life, go back & find out 

what kind of a being God is. If I am the man 

that shows you what kind of a being God 

is, then let evry man & woman sit in silence 

and never lift up his hand against me again 

if I do not do it, I will not make any further 

pretentions to inspiration or to be a prophet 

I would be like the rest of the world, fals teachers 

& you would want to take my life. But you 

might just as well take the lives of other fals teaches 

as mine if I was fals, But meddle not with 

any man for his religion, evry goverment ought 

to permit evry man to enjoy his religion. I will 

show the world is ^w^rong by showing what God is 

I am going to inquire after God so that you 

may know God, that persecution may cease 

concerning me. I go back to the beginning to 

show what kind of a being God was. I will 

tell you & hear it O Earth! God who sits 

in yonder heavens is a man like yourselves

That GOD if you were to see him to day that 

holds the worlds you would see him like a 

man in form, like yourselves. Adam was



 END_ENTRY made in his image and talked with him, walked 

with him. In order to understand the dead for 

the consolation of those that mourn, I want 

you to understand God and how he comes to be 

God. We suppose that God was God from 

eternity, I will refute that Idea, or I will do 

away or take away the veil so you may see. It is 

the first principle to know that we may convers 

with him and that he once was man like us, 

and the Father was once on an earth like us, 

And I wish I was in a suitable place to tell it. 

The scriptures inform us mark it that Jesus Christ 

said As the Father hath power in himself ss [so] hath 

the son power in himself to do what the father 

did even to lay down my body & take it up again 

do you believe it if not dont believe the bible

I defy all Hell and earth to refute it. And you 

have got to learn how to make yourselves God, king 

and priest, by going from a small capacity 

to a great capacity to the resurrection of the dead 

to dwelling in everlasting burnings. I want you 

to know the first principle of this law, how cons-

oling to the mourner when they part with a friend 

to know that though they lay down this dody [body]

it will rise & dwell with everlasting burnings to 

be an heir of God & joint heir of Jesus Christ 

enjoying the same rise exhaltation & glory untill 

you arive at the station of a God. what did Jesus 

Christ do, the same thing as I se the Father do 

see the father do what work out a kingdom, when 

I do so to I will give to the father which will add to 

his glory, he will take a Higher exhaltation & I 

will take his place and am also exhalted. These 

are the first principles of the gospel. It will take 

a long time after the grave to understand the whole

If I should say any thing but what was in the bible 

the cry of treason would be herd I will then 

go to the Bible.



 END_ENTRY Barasheet in the beginning, Analize the word 

in and through the head, an old Jew added the word 

Bath, it red the head one of the gods, broat forth 

the gods. I will transpose it in the english language. 

I want you to know & learn that the Holy Ghost

knows sumthing. The grand Council set 

at the head and contemplated the 

creation of the world, some will say the script-

ures say so & so, but I will show you a text 

out of an old book containing the four langua

ges, the german is here what does this text 

say, yoakabeam, the son of Zebedee, the 

bible says James the son of Zebedee, but this 

says Jacob son of Zebedee 21 ch 4th ver Matthew 

The Dr says (I mean Dr of Law not of physic) 

If you say any thing not according to the Bible 

we will cry treason, But if ye are not led by 

revelation how can ye escape the damnation 

of Hell, here we have the testimony of four. I have 

the oldest Book in the world & the Holy Ghost

I thank God for the old Book but more for 

the Holy Ghost. The Gods came together & 

concocked the plan of making the world & the 

inhabitants, having an knowledge of God we 

know how to Approach him & ask & he will answer 

An other thing the learned Dr says the Lords 

made the world out of nothing, you tell 

them that God made the world out of 

sumthing, & they think you are a fool. But 

I am learned & know more than the whole 

world, the Holy Ghost does any how, & I will 

associate my self wit it. Beaureau to organize 

the world out of Chaotic matter, element 

they are principles that cannot be disolved 

they may be reorganized. Another subject 

which is calculated to exhalt man I wish to 

speak of. The resurrection of the dead



 END_ENTRY The soul the mind of man, whare did it 

come from. The learned says God made it 

in the beginning, but it is not so, I know better 

God has told me so. If you dont believe it, it wont 

make the truth without effect God was a self 

exhisting being, man exhist upon the same prin-

ciple. God made a tabernacle & put a spirit in it 

and it became a Human soul, man exhisted in 

spirit & mind coequal with God himself, you 

who mourn the loss of friends are ownly seper-

ted for a moment, the spirit is seperated for 

a little time, they are now conversant with 

each other as we are on the earth. I am dwel-

ling on the immutibility of the spirit of man, is 

it logic to say the spirit of man had a begining 

& yet had no end, it does not have a begining 

or end, my ring is like the exhistanc of man 

it has no begining or end, if cut into their 

would be a begining & end, so with man 

if it had a begining it will have an end if 

I am right I might say God never had power 

to create the spirit of man, God himself could 

not create himself. Intelligence is Eternal 

& it is self exhisting. All mind that is susseptible 

of improvement, the relationship we have 

with God places us in a situation to advance in 

knowledge. God has power to institute laws 

to instruct the weaker intelligences that they 

may be exhalted with himself this is good d

doctrin, it taste good. I can taste the principles 

of eternal life, so can you, they are given 

to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ and I 

know you believe it. All things ^that^ God sees fit 

to reveal to us in relation to us, reveals his comma-

ndments to our spirits, and in saving our spirits 

we save the body, (the same as though we had no (Body



 END_ENTRY How comes the awful responsibility if in relation 

to our dead, if they do not be baptized they must 

be damned. (I wish I had 40 days to talk) what 

promises are made, what can be said if in the 

grave, God dwells in eternity, and he does not 

view things as we do, the greatest responsibility 

lade open us in this life is in relation to our dead

Paul cannot be made perfect without us, for it is 

necessary that the seals are in our hands to seal our 

children & our dead for the fulness of the dispensation 

of times, A dispensation to meet the promises made 

by Jesus Christ befor the foundation of the world 

for the salvation of man. All sins and blasphemys 

were to be forgiven except the sin against the 

Holy Ghost. God has made provision for evry spirit 

in the eternal world, and the spirits of our 

friends should be searched out & saved. Any man 

that has a friend in eternity can save him 

if he has not commit the unpardonable sin. He 

cannot be damned through all eternity, their is 

a possibility for his escape in a little time. If a 

man has knowledge he can be saved, if he has been 

guilty of great sins he is punished for it, when he 

consents to obey the gospel whether, Alive or dead, 

he is saved, his own mind damns him I have no 

fear of hell fire that dont exhist. No man can 

commit the unpardonable sin, untill He receives 

the Holy Ghost. All will suffer untill they obey 

Christ himself, even the devil said I am a savior 

and can save all rose up in rebelion against God 

and was cast down. Jesus Christ will save 

all except the sons of perdition. What must 

a man do to commit the unpardonable sin 

they must receive the Holy Ghost have the 

heavens opened unto them, & know God & then 

sin against him, this is the case with many



 END_ENTRY apostates in this Church they never scease to try

to hurt me, they have got the same spirit the devil

had, you cannot save them, they make open 

war like the devil, stay all that hear, dont make

any hasty mooves you may be saved, if a spirit

of Bitterness is in you, dont be in haste, Say you

that man is a sinner, well if he repents he

shall be forgiven. I could go back and trace evry

subject of interest concerning the relationship of

man to God if i had time, their is many mansions

in my fathers Kingdom, what have we to console 

us in relation to our dead, we have the greatest

hope in relation to our dead of any people on

earth we have seen them walk worthy on earth

and those who have died in the faith are now

in the selestial kingdom of God, they have gone

to await the resurrection of the dead to go to

the celestial glory, while their is many who die

who will have to wait many years. But I am

authorized to say to you my friends in the name of

the Lord that you may wait for your friends to come

forth to meet you in Eternity in the morn of the

celestial world, those saints who have been murdered

in the persecution shall triumph in the Celestial

world while their murderers shall dwell in torment

untill they pay the utmost farthing.





I have Fathers, Brothers, Children, that are gone to

eternity soon to meet me, the time will soon be

gone, the trump will soon be blown. A question

will Mothers have their Children in Eternity[?]

yes, yes, you will have the Children ^But^ as it falls

so it will rise. It will never grow. It will be

in its precise form as it fell in its mothers

arms. Eternity is full of thrones upon which

dwell thousands of children reigning on thrones

of glory not one cubit added to their stature



 END_ENTRY I will leave this subject here and make a few

remarks upon Baptism. I will read a tex in Jerman

upon Baptism. John says I Baptise you with water

but when Jesus Christ comes He shall administer

the baptism of fire & the Holy Ghost. John

said his baptism was good for nothing without

the baptism of Jesus Christ. Many talk of

any baptism not being essential to salvation

but this would lay the foundation of their damn

ation. There has also been remarks made concern-

ing all men being redeemed from Hell, But

I say that any man who commits the unpardon-

able sin must dwell in hell worlds without end





Conference adjourned till to morrow 10 oclock



 END_ENTRY April 8, 1844 ~ Monday





Conference met at 10 oclok April 8th

President J Smith arose and said it is impossible to

continue the subject that I spoke upon yesterday

in consequence of the weekness of my lungs.

Yet I have a proclamation to make to the Elders

you know the Lord has led the church untill the

present time. I have now a great proclamation

for the Elders to teach the church here after

which is in relation to Zion. The whole of

North and South America is Zion, the mountain

of the Lords House is in the centre of North & South

America, when the house is done, Baptism font erected

and finished & the worthy are washed, anointed, endowed

& ordained kings & priests, which must be done

in this life, when the place is prepared you must

go through all the ordinances of the house of the

Lord so that you who have any dead friends must

go through all the ordinances for them the same as

for yourselves; then the Elders are to go through

all America & build up Churches untill all Zion

is built up, but not to commence to do this untill

the Temple is built up here and the Elders endowed

then go forth & accomplish the work & build up

stakes in all North and South America. Their

will be some place ordained for the redeeming

of the dead I think this place will be the one, so their

will be gathering fast enough here. President

Smith lungs failed him and he appointed elder

G. J. Adams to occupy the time during the foornoon

He however remarked that his proclamation

just made was the greatest ever made as all

could not come here, but it was necessary that

enough should come to build up the temple &

get an endowment so that the work could spread

abroad



 END_ENTRY April 7, 1837 ~ Friday





April 7th [FIGURE] I spent the day in writing my Journal. & when

the shades of evening began to appear I repaired to the house

of the LORD in company with Elders Milton Holmes,

& Joseph B Nobles for the purpose of worshiping God

we entered one of the stands within the veils & fell

upon our knees & satan appeared also but not to

worship God but to deprive us of the privilege

Satan strove against us with great power by

tempting & otherwis he at one time drove me from

my stand while I was striving with my brethren

to enter into the visions of heaven Notwithstanding

his apparent victory good grew out of it for by going

into the outer court I there found Elder Freeman

Nickerson an aged father in Israel who was faithful

& Prayed to God alway I solicited him to join us in prayer

that we might gain a victory over satan & get a blessing

at the hand of God He joyfully accepted the invitation

& we again entered the stand being four of us in number

of one accord in one place. We had great cause to be

united in heart We all had travled together about 1,000

miles in the spring of 1834 for the redemption of

Zion we at that time offered to lay down our lives

& our offering was accepted as was Abram's. We felt

considering those circumstances that we could kneel

down & unitedly get a blessing by faith through Jesus

Christ We fell upon our Knees & began to cry unto

God Satan departed, tempation found no place in

our harts The power of God rested upon us & we

were baptized with the Holy Ghost & the spirit of

God was like fire shut up in our bones we were

immersed in the liberty of the sons of God many great

things were shown unto us the power of God & the

spirit of prophesy & revelation rested upon us I arose

& proclaimed many glorious thing upon the heads of

my beloved brethreth that were present which were

dictated in my heart by the Holy Spirit. And I

Willford testify in the name of Jesus Christ that many 

precious things were shown me concerning my brethren

by the Holy Spirit in prophecy & revelation. Our hearts

were made glad & we went our way rejoicing [FIGURE]

April 8th Spent the day in writing my Journal

Spent the evening at Elder Milicans in Good Company





April 9, 1837 ~ Sunday





9th Sunday morning I repaired to the house of

the Lord to worship with the Saints Father John

Smith opened the meeting by prayer then read the

##2 Nephi 12|twelvth chapter## of the second Book of Nephi &

preached from it unto the people. In the latter

part of the Day Elder Kimble addressed the saints

in the power of God. Elder O. Pratt followed with few

remarks after communion. President S Rigdon

addressed the congregation & laid before them

their situation as to temporal things, as the gentiles

are striving to besiege the saints in Kirtland &

would be glad to starve the saints to death. He also

stated that the Presidency had used every means

for the deliverance of the church but as many of

the church had refused Kirtlan currency which

was their temporal salvation in consequence

of this they put strength in the hands of their

enemies & those that had done this thing must

suffer by it Sidney closed and





Joseph arose & like the lion

of the tribe of JUDAH he poured out his soul

in the midst of the Congregation of the Saints

but who can find lang^u^ague to write his words

& teachings as with an iron pen in a rock that

they may stand for future generation to look

upon. A fountain of knowledge rolled from

his mouth to the people which was the word of

God. Yea in the name of God he proclaimed

that severe Judgment awaited those characters

that professed to be be his friends & friends

to humanity & the Kirtland Safety Society

But had turned tr[a]itors & opposed the curr

ency & its friends which has given power into

the hands of the enemy & oppressed the poor

saints such have become covenant Break

ers for which they will feel the wrath of God

as true as Joseph is a prophet



 END_ENTRY Joseph uttered the feelings of his soul in pain while

viewing the poverty & afflictions of Ephraim or

the Saints in Kirtland at least that fals brethren

should be whited walls & bring perrils upon the

Saints. Joseph is as a father to Ephraim & to all

Israel in these last days, he mourns because

of unbelief & the negligence manifest with ma

ny who have receieved the gospel in obeying

the commands of God he fears lest ^but^ few

be left to receieve an inheritance. There is

not a greater man than Joseph standing in

this generation. The gentiles look upon him

& he is to them like bed of Gold conceled

from human view: they know not his prin

ciple, his spirit, his wisdom, virtue, phylanthr

opy, nor his calling. His mind like Enochs

swells wide as eternity Nothing short of a

God can comprehend his soul

April. 13th 1837. Marriage being an institution

of heaven & honourable in all. I accordingly

accepted the honour upon this memorial day,

by joining hands with Miss PHEBE W. CARTER

in the bonds of matrimony and took upon ourse-

lves the marriage covenant. Elder Johnathan

Holmes Also took the same responsibility

upon himself at the same time by giving his hand

to Miss Mary Carter in the marriage coven

ant. We were married at the house of

President JOSEPH SMITH, Jr The ceremony

was solemnized by President Frederick G.

Williams President. J. Smith Sen the Patriarch

then blessed us in the name of the Lord and

pronounced great Blessings upon us & our

posterity. President. J. Smith Jr was expecting

to solemnize the ceremony, but his life was

so beset & sought for by wicked and ungodly

men for the testimony of JESUS, that he was

under the necessity of fleeing from his house

& home for a few days. O when will the

prophets of ^God^ rest upon the earth.





We were married at 2 oclock PM

and at 4 PM. the whole company consisting

of about 16 couple walked from President

While all nature smiled without

THE LAST DISPENSATION OF THE GOSPEL





Solemn and interesting are the scenes and living

realities of the present generation of the human

family. The reflecting mind may flit back with 

the rapidity of lightning to the day when GOD spake

and chaos herd and this world came into order, then

from the days of ADAM trace the history of man

down to 1830 years after Christ both sacred and

profane and place their history in a point of light

to comprehend in one combined mass all the rise,

progress, decline, and fall of all the nations, kindgdoms,

and empires of the earth and they do not form a more

compounded scenery of grand awful sublime and

important events than is to traspire in this last dispens

ation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The prophets and apo

stles & all inspired men of God in every age of a theocrat

ical government have looked, spake, & written respecting

this generation with feelings of the deepest interest. In 1830 the

stone began to roll. The Church & body of Christ became vis

ible It will continue to be propeled by the arm of JEHOVAH

untill the Kingdom fills the whole earth & Israel gatherd Babylon

falls & Christ reigns. Then marvel not O ye reader that the Patr

iarch Joseph pronounces blessings upon the children of EPHRAIM

in the spirit in the spirit of God maintaining Joseph

in his integrity. But, Alas, one arose, once a friend,

(not now) in the blackness of his face & corruption of

Yes at 11 oclock AM I entered the school

taught by Sister Eunice Woodruff. Five

hours I spent within its walls amid as

great variety of sensations as ever vibr

ated my bosom. I beheld my Sister my 

ownly Sister seventeen years of age,

adorned with youth, modesty, and lovlin

ess, her face veiled with the true

picture of PHILO. With a degree of

admiration I gaz'd upon the change five

years had brought upon her. Her spri

ghtly step with energy was marked wh

ile teaching the young. To more per

fectly call to mind the recollection of

youth and past scenes and to enterta

in my mind amid the passing hours, this

Sister presented me, with a cheerful

grace, a bundle of Letters from an

absent Brother. I look'd them throu

gh and throug, they pressed my soul

with feelings. Asahel yes thy letters

I read fifteen in number to thy sister

directed. They brought to my soul as

great ^a^ variety of feelings, as matter they

contained. They presented before they ^my^





mind ^view^ the display of a cultivated mind

and the refined talents of a brother

presented to a Sister with the most

untarnished friendship, and deepest

feeling for her wellfare that can grace

the human Soul. Such teaching as

those to Eunice directed if followed

by the female youth would lead them

by a thousand snares. The name of

Willford was mentioned oft {I think

he mistakes my call} (O, GOD protect my Brothers,

my Sister, my wife, and my Parents,

for Jesus sake) While at once I vie

wed this three years convers of Ashahel

I smiled, I wept. Eunice preserve those

in memory of a brothers LOVE. I left

the house and by my sisters side I

viewed the Colebrooke landscapes as

we walked. O I spake of Asahel, I tho

ught of him. We visited our Parents dw

elling at Sages mills, but they had gone to

Farmington. Stumps & stones, house and

all looked natural, the house I visited no

parent or brother was there, all silent as

death, I drop'd a tear, Eunice plucked a rose

as we left we was soon receieved by

Jonathan Stillmans took a seat at his board

and closed the scene

How pleasing and how painful are the scenes of life

at 8 oclok President B Young in the Chair

Elder Amasa Lyman made some appropriat remarks

had followed men that done more hurt than

good flung more obstructions in the way than they

took out had taken half of his time to remove

prejudice caused by unwise Elders, for God sake

dont preach a thing you dont know, dont appear

before the public in a capacity you cannot maintain

A man in Iowa called a congregation the first

thing he did was to read a Patriarchal blessing

which had some strong meat in it, he would

have done better to have preached the gospel





I had rather hear brethren appear small th[an]

large I had rather see a man hold his brother

up than pull him down. Preach what will

save men the same that converted you will

convert them.





Elder B Young arose

and the above doctrin was true and I will add

a remark to it if a man tries to rise by pulling



 END_ENTRY another down he will sink as soon as a peace of

pot mettle. Preach faith repentance & Baptism

say nothing but repentance to this generation

need not go into mysteries preach the same over again

when I heard Br Joseph make his proclamation

yesterday I thought it was a sweepstakes when he

said North & South America was Zion. Any Elder

that will be wise when he gets his endowment can go

into any city & build up the largest church in the

city this prooves the prophet true, that the priesthood

is fitted for the condition of evry man & woman

that was on the earth. will the elders go out this

season & preach the things we tell them to & then

stop, build up churches in all the world is a perfect

knock down to mobs, now Mo Mob away and best

let us alone and we will evangelize the world and not

make much fuss about it, mob us & we will do it

sooner. We want the Elders to electioneer for

President Smith and we want to build the temple

this season and by the help of God you ^we^ will do

it. Pay your tithing if you want a seat in that

house. many other usful remarks was made by

Elder Young. Conference Adjourned untill

2 oclok. Met according to adjournment and

called to order by president Brigham Young

President Joseph Young proceded to ordain

a number of Elders into the quorum of the Seventies

B Young remarked O ye Elders of Israel you

are the first fruits of the kingdom of God on the

earth that is to swallow up all other kingdoms on

the earth, now be wise and not fools like many

smart young men who have sunk themselves in

degradation & infamy, when you go out go before God

in prayer and faith. Joseph said he was not known

in our midst, he might live & die and not be fully

known untill he was weighed in the balance in the

eternal world. You do not fully know the day



 END_ENTRY of your visitation the work is beginning to be seen

by the Saints, when J. C. Bennet went forth to 

try to destroy the Saints. A little company of us 

went before God and asked him to take away his 

power, and it fell like lightning from Heaven

we asked for Duncan not to be Govornor he was 

not but he is now dead and damned. We asked 

for Reynolds to be taken away, he soon shot 

himself & went to Hell. Carlin is dead and so 

our enemies have fallen on evry hand, whare is 

the officers of Government in Washington

seven were hurled into eternity in an instant by 

the bursting of a big gun, the bitter branches 

are beginning to be cut off, take care O, man how 

you oppose this work for their is a God in Israel

cannot you practice virtue & holiness in this 

church yes and it is the corrupt & wicked 

that oppose the work, go out & do good and work 

righteousness.



 

W. W. Phelps said we want to 

get up a general meeting in Nauvoo as a kind of 

convention and we want to do the same in all 

the saints states. He remarked that General Smith had 

undertaken a great work even unto the fulfilling 

of the Prophets relating to this dispensation A 

contribution was taken up for Joseph Smith

17th [FIGURE] 5 I wrote five letters to the following 

Persons viz Smith Tuttle. M. Holmes, L Scamman 

Freedom and Shuah Molton. and Sister Jerman

I accompanied the Twelve to the Temple and 

we went onto the top of its walls & viewed the 

Country, encouraged the workman. I had 

some council from Elder Young concerning the 

affairs of the kingdom my mishion &c





August 18, 1844 ~ Sunday





18th [FIGURE] Sunday I met I vast congregation 

of the Saints at the grove to hear a discourse 

from President Young upon the present excite-

ment that is through Nauvoo in consequence of 

unwise teaching by some that are trying to 

draw away a party after them the following is 

a synopsis of the discourse





President Young arose and said that he had ^I have^ many 

things to speak of. It was my mind in the first 

place that we should have suitable time to meditate 

upon all matters and weigh them, even evry 

subject wharein we felt interested. When the 

question was asked me if they should con

tinue to Baptise for the dead. I said I had no 

council to give upon that subject at that time ^present^ but 

should think it not best to attend to it at that 

time. I have learned some things I did not know 

when I came home. I discover a disposition in 

the sheep to scatter abroad now the shepherd is taken 

away. I do not say that it will never be right for 

this people to go from here or scatter abroad but let 

them wait untill the time comes & untill they 

get Council to do so. The report has gone forth through 

the city that the Twelve has have a secret understanding



 END_ENTRY with those men who are going away to take a ^& taking^

company with them, that they shall take all 

they can but ^although^ the Twelve will blow it up in 

public but ^yet^ privately ^they^ wish it to go on, but if 

it was the last words I had to say before going into 

the Eternal world I would swear by the Holy 

Trinity that it was ^is^ utterly fals and not a word 

of truth in it, their is no man ^that has^ any right to 

lead away one soul out of this city by the consent 

of the Twelve, except Lyman Wight and Geo 

Miller ^who have^ had the privilege of taking the Pine Company 

whare they pleased but not any other another soul has 

the consent of the Twelve to go with them. Their ^There^ 

is no man ^who has^ any liberty to lead away people into 

the wilderness from this Church or to lead them 

any whare els not by the consent of the Twelve 

or the Church except the case above named and 

I tel you in the name of Jesus Christ, that if 

Lyman Wight & Geo Miller take a course contrary 

to our council, and will not act in consent with 

us but take a course against us they will be 

damned and go to destruction, and if men 

will not stop striving to be great and exhalted and 

lead away parties from us and strive to weaken 

our hands they will fall and not rise again. and 

I will destroy their influence in this church with 

the help of God and my brethren. I wish you to 

distinctly to understand that the Council of the 

Twelve is for evry family that does not belong to the 

Pine Company to stay here in Nauvoo, and build up 

the Temple & get your endowment, dont 

scatter. United we stand divided we fall. it has 

been whispered about that all that go into the 

wilderness with Wight and Miller will get their 

endowment, but they cannot give an endowment



 END_ENTRY in the wilderness. If we do not carry out the 

plan Joseph has laid and the pattern he has given 

for us to work by we cannot get any further 

endowment I want it to sink deep into your heart 

that you may remember it. I repeat it, let me 

reason with you. If you stir up the flame of dissent 

will you get an endowment No, you get a party 

to run here and another there, and divide our 

strength, and weaken our hands and we will be 

left and our enemies will flock around us and destroy 

us in that case you will not get your endowment 

but will sink and not rise go to hell and not to 

the bosom of Abraham. do the people leave here

because they are afraid^?^ what are you Cowards,^?^ 

do you fear those that have power to kill the body

and have no other power more than him that has 

power to cast both soul and body in hell. If you 

leave this place for fear of the mob before God 

tells you to go you will have no place of rest 

but you will flee from place to place and go 

like the jews untill God raises up some other

people to redeem you for if the devil scares

you from this place he will scare you from 

all other places. Let no man go from this place 

but the pine country brethren but stay here^,^ sow 

plant, build, put your plow share^s^ into the prairies

one plow share will do more to drive off the mob 

than two guns. let us stay here with ^where^ the bones 

of Joseph and Hiram Samuel ^Don^ Carloss and father 

Smith ^are^, Joseph has said if I am slain in battle

or fall any way I want my body laid lain in Nauvoo

I had rather have the dead body of the prophet 

than some men who are alive, and I should rather 

have the clothes of the prophet stuffed with straw

for President ^of the US^ than any man whose name is now

before the nation for a candidate for he would



 END_ENTRY would not do so much harm. We want to build

the Temple in this place if we have to build

it as the Jews built the walls of the Temple in

Jerrusalem with a sword in one hand and the

trowell in the other. how easily ^some^ men are scared

this child was never ^I have not been^ frightened yet and I

know of other men who are ^have^ not. Do you suppose

the mouth of God is closed to be opened unt 

no more unto us. If this was the case I would 

not give the ashes of arie straw for the salvati-

ion of the Church. If God has ceased to speak

By the Holy Ghost or revelation their is no

salvation but this is not the case. Their seems

to be a disposition by many to leave Nauvoo & 

go into the wilderness or some whare els, but what

if we should go into the wilderness, and we 

should ask God to give us an endowment, and 

he should ask if we were driven from 

Nauvoo and who drove you? the devel drove

us, would be the answer. well he might say did 

you not know that I had power over the devil,

yes but one said that I would not give a Jack 

knife for all Nauvoo and another said I would 

not give a pair of mules for the best farm

in Hancock Co and I was afraid. would the

Lord give an endowment to a people that would

be fritened away from ^their^ duty.^?^ Those that are 

wishing to lead away parties contrary to council 

I would not wish them damned worse than

to have a company after their own liking for 

they will soon quarrel among themselves;

and if we should go to the wilderness and 

ask the Lord, to give us an endowment He might

ask us saying did I not give you rock in Nauvoo

to build the temple with[?] yes. Did I not through my



 END_ENTRY providence furnish men to quirry & cut the 

stone & prepare them ^it^ for the building yes did I 

not give you means to build the Temple there^?^ 

yes. vary well had you have died in Nauvoo

on the walls of the Temple or in your fields

I would have taken you to glory ^myself^ and raised 

up men to officiate for you and you would have

got ^and enjoyed^ the highest glory. did you make a sacrafice 

by tithing^?^ No well I dont wonder you did 

not believe I had power over the devil.

Such may go away. But I want to have the 

faithful stay here to settle the city. we shall

require the 10th of all your property for the ^as a^ 

tithing for the building of the Temples, the

poor and for the Priesthood. I want my support and 

living by the church hereafter so that I can 

give my whole time to the business of the church

I have always supported myself heretofore in all

my travels and labours. While in England one 

year, we circulated 60,000 tracts upon our 

doctrin. this ought to be done in all the world

^and it can be where the Elders are faithful in their calling^

The testitor ^Joseph^ has always lived ^been preserved^ untill now, but he

has now sealed his testimony with his blood 

and his testiment should now be put in force

while the testator lived it was all in his hands

but now he is dead. Their is no remission of 

sins without the Sheding of Blood. you will

soon wake up and know things as they are their 

has been a great dept paid. their will be no need 

of more Blood of the Saints being shed at present

by and by you will understand and see that all

is right. WO, WO, WO, unto all who have

shed the blood of the Saints and the Lords 

Anointed it must needs be that offences come 

but wo unto that man through whome they come



 END_ENTRY to those that want to go away from this place I 

would say wait untill the time comes. I will 

give you the key. North and South America 

is Zion and as soon as the temple is done and 

you get your endowment you can go and 

build up statkes but dont be in haste, wait untill 

the Lord says go. If you have the spirit of 

God you can discover right from wrong. when 

all is right with the priesthood is right ^&^ A man is 

rises up and speaks in the spirit of God and 

just right All will say Amen but when 

a man rises up and talks as smooth as oil 

if he is not right their will be many queries 

about it^,^ it will not satisfy ^edify^ the body I give 

this as a key. You may go all over North 

and South America & build up stakes when 

the time comes. The whole continant of 

America must be organized into districts 

and Presiding elders appointed over each 

district, the time has come when all 

things must be set in order. I have had these 

things upon my mind a long time. the time 

has come now for bickerings to scease their there must 

be a strict order of things, and we are no longer 

bound to harbor black legs, counterfieters, boges 

makers, we know all about them they have been 

in our midst long enough. I advise all the Saints 

to have no dealing with such men let them alone

the time has come that they should be wiped 

out of our midst, let those men alone, let the ungod-

ly dealers alone. And as to the doctors who are in 

our midst who are our enemies I would say let 

them alone, for I have no boubt but that three 

to one who have died in this place had a doctor 

and I would say wo unto yo^u^ Lawyers for their ^your^



 END_ENTRY whole study is to put down truth and put a lie 

in its stead. I want the Lawyers to know that 

we have common sens^e^ they want to make 

you believe that when you spell Baker it 

means cider or whiskey; Now let the Lawyers 

and doctors alone and leave all ^off^ bitterness and 

evil speaking alone and you will build the Temple 

and get an endowment. All ye Lawyiers go 

away and let us alone, and when we want you 

and we ^&^ get full of the devil ^& want you^ we will send for you, 

we may then have a more convenient season 

but go thy way for this time, and I want to 

say to all Saints do not harbor black legs coun-

terfeiters, and bogas makers wipe them away

it is time to carry out the design of our prophet

do scease to employ doctors Lawyers & Merchants 

who will empty your purs and then mob you

Store your grain in Nauvoo for you will want 

it here, to eat while you are bilding the Temple. 

I want to say to the hands upon the Temple be 

united and I want to say to the committee ^I say^ 

dont turn away any person because he is an 

Englishman, Scotchman Irishman or any other 

nation, but employ evry man you can and build 

the temple and your homes. I had rather pay 

out evry sent I have to build up this place 

and get an endowment If I was driven the 

next minute, without any thing to take with me 

As to the doctors let them go. I can prove that 

a doctor in this place doctored a woman that 

was in the family way and did not know it 

untill she was delivered, and both woman and 

child died, and if you will employ them 

you will all die, but the time has come



 END_ENTRY when you need no longer to support 

them. their is a distinction between the 

law of the Land and the law of the Church 

you have the privilege of keeping all shops that 

does not come in contack with the Law of 

the state county or city, so I will evade the law 

says the dealer and give away whiskey and 

sell a little tobaco or somthing & charge enough 

for both, but the law of the Church will 

reach such men if they are members for they 

will be cut off. (I had a dream which I will 

here relate I saw a fruit tree, & I went into the 

tree in search of fruit. I soon discovered that some 

of the main branches on ^the^ top g^r^oing from the main 

body was dead; It seemed necessary to cut off 

the dead branches in order to save the tree so I 

told some person to help me cut them off & they 

steped on to a large green limb they were afraid it 

would break, so I put my sholder under it & held 

it up while he cut off the dead branches it cracked 

the green limb but it did not break. after we cut 

of[f] the dry limbs the wounds healed up and the 

tree grew finely) now let us cut of the dead bran

ches of the Church that good fruit may grow 

and the voice will soon be herd go and build 

Zion and the great Temple of the Lord.



 

A word unto the Seventies they will be organized 

into their different quorums and a Presidency 

of seven men will be chosen out of the first 

seventy to preside over each quorum. Now as you 

have been warned let evry man warn his Neighbor

and we will give evry man his appointment

as soon as convenient





May the Lord bless you in the name of

Jesus Christ Amen ^see next page^

Bible, and preached to the Saints. Be he seemed to

Beloved Mother in Israel according to your request 

I lay my hands upon your head, in the name of Jesus 

Christ of Nazareth and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood 

and the [FIGURES] [keys] of the kingdom of God to bestow a blessing 

upon you for thou art worthy of all blessings.

him as he lay upon his bed like Jacob of old ready 

to gather up his feet and sleep with his fathers, and I 

about to take my departure over the sea to visit 

foreign nations, which was the last time we ever 

met on earth. In like manner do I essteem 

it a blessing and a privilege to lay my hands upon 

your head, in your decline of life to leave with 

you my parting blessing as I am again called 

to bid farewell to my native country and visit 

foreign climes to bear record of the word of 

God we may never meet again on earth. But I 

thank my God that I have this privilege of blessing 

thee for my heart is full of blessings for thee, for 

thou has art the greatest Mother in Israel, the 

sons thou hast bourn and Cherished, are the most 

noble spirits that ever graced humanity or taber-

nacled in flesh. their work shall be had in honorable 

rememberance through all generations of men. 

Though counted among transgressors, they like the 

Messiah have shed their blood for the sins of the 

people, and freely offered their lives and sealed 

their testimony ^with their Blood^. Tho[u] hast lived and stood to see 

the fall of thy sons by the rage of gentile hands, 

and like an impenatrible rock in the mids of the 

mighty deep thou hast remained unmoved



 END_ENTRY untill God has given ^thee^ the desires of thy heart 

in seeing the Keys of the Kingdom of God held

it untill he reigns whose right it is to reign. 

Let thy heart be comforted in the midst of thy 

sorrow, for thou shalt be had in honorable remem

berance forever in the congregations of the righteous 

thou shalt be remembered in thy wants during 

the remainder of thy day, and when thou art 

called to depart thou canst lie down in peace 

having seen the salvation of God, in laying an 

everlasting foundation for the deliverance ^of Israel^ through 

the instrumentality of thy sons. I seal upon 

your head all the blessings of the fulness of the 

gospel and of the Church of the first born, and 

all those blessings that have been sealed upon 

you heretofore. If we meet no more on earth 

we will meet in the morn of the first resurrection 

whare you shall recieve thrones, powers, a dominion 

and kingdom in connexion with thy husband in 

his high exhaltation in the linage of his fathers. I

A variety of subjects was conversed upon among 

others measures were entered into to hasten the Temple 

as speady as possible, to council young men from 

abroad to come in and bring money and means to spend 

for that purpose. It was thought best for the Saints to 

go north into the colder country to build a branch it 

was thought best for Br Wight to go north with his 

company and not South. The quorum of the Twelve blessed 

at follows

rejoice therein and shout Hosanna. you shall have 

Power and wisdom to accomplish the design of

up my trunk and writing





August 25, 1844 ~ Sunday





25th Sunday I met with the congregation 

of the Saints in Nauvoo I was called upon to 

address them inasmuch as I was about to leave 

them to go on a mission to England. I arose and 

delivered them my farewell address it was short

The following is a few items which I presented to the 

People. Their is a spirit in man and the inspiration 

of the Almighty giveth it understanding it is through 

this principle that this congregation is assembled 

together at this Place. you had understanding of 

the things of God by the spirit of God. And I have 

now one important declaration to make unto you and 

that is that inasmuch as you will be united in heart 

mind and action in supporting your councillors the 

authority of the, church the Priesthood of God 

and follow the council given you; as you have 

endeavored to follow the council of the Prophet 

while he was living, you will be safe and blessed 

and will Prosper but if you are divided and reject 

the council of God you will fall, union and faithful

ness is your salvation. It is true you have been 

led by one of the best men that ever has graced 

humanity, or tabernacled in flesh but he has gone

he has sealed his testimony with his blood. he has 

loved this people unto death. But I would now call 

upon this people to be united in building upon the 

foundation which The Prophet Joseph has laid



 END_ENTRY It is true you have been called to suffer much in 

the cause in which you are engaged but if Judgment 

bgins at the house of God, babylon will not escape

and if their is a fire in a green tree a dry tree will 

not escape the fire, and their is no people more 

prepared for the shok that is coming on the earth than 

than the latter day Saints, for the object we have is 

to secure blessings beyound the veil in the first resurr-

ection this ^is wh[a]t^ we are preparing for. Again I would say 

let not the saints be troubled because they have lost 

their Prophet. for I would ask because the Prophet 

has sealed his testimony with his Blood if that destroys 

the gospel, or take^s^ away the power of God, is truth 

anhilated, or has the Priesthood found a burying 

place I tell you Nay it has ^does^ not, the ^His^ testiment 

is now in force. therefore my council is to follow 

the example of those who have gone before and 

be faithful untill death, if you will be united

ment. I exhorted them to faithfulness and requested

many interesting remarks. Also Elders O Hyde 

and P. P. Pratt testifyed that Joseph the Prophet and 

Seer had ordained, anointed, and appointed the 

Twelve to lead the Church had given them the 

Keys of the Kingdom of God for that purpose 

W. W. Phelps and R, Cahoon bore testimony to the 

same thing, saying that Joseph said unto the 

Twelve upon your sholdiers the kingdom of God must 

rest in all the world, now round up your sholdiers and 

bear it many important things were spoken that 

I have not time to write. The brethren came forward

August 27, 1844 ~ Tuesday





27th This was an exeeding busy and laborious 

day with me. It was the last day that I or my family 

shall spend in Nauvoo for many days. I have 

left my family and friends almost yearly to go 

on missions in the vineyard of the Lord, for the 

last ten years of my life, but have never attempted 

to take my family with me before for the purpose 

of accompaning me on a mission, but as I am now 

about to leave my own country to again visit foreign 

climes to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ & take 

care of the Churches which will probably be a



 END_ENTRY long mission I conclude it best to take my 

family with ^me^ according to the Council of the Twelve

so this day is spent settleing accounts taking 

inventoriey of Goods and Chatels left, packing up 

goods, recieving letters, bid[d]ing friends farewell 

blessing the Saints, which continued untill midnight

[FIGURE] At 12 oclok at night in company with Mrs Wood-

ruff, Br A. O. Smoot, Sisters Smoot, and Hannah 

Ells, we walked to the Temple of the Lord in 

Nauvoo, and as we approached it we lifted up 

our eyes and beheld the greatness grandure and 

glory that presented itself to our view in a conspic-

uous manner while she was covered with the silver 

rays of the Queen of the night who was pouring the 

whole strength of the brightness of her glory upon 

her it presented an imposing, grand, and sublime 

senery to the beholder, after gazing a few moments 

upon her magnus walls, and examining her capitols 

which were completed, standing on the ground, we 

all as of one accord assended the laders unto the 

top on of the walls, several of the poliece and friends 

followed our example, among which was Gen C C Rich 

and Elder Godard we repaired to the South west 

corner of the Temple and their in company with 

Mrs Woodruff & the above named brethren and sisters

we bowed our knees upon the top corner stone 

which was prepaired to recieve its Capitol, And their 

with uplifted hands towards heaven, I called 

upon the God of Abraham Isaac, Jacob and Joseph 

by Prayer and supplication to except the gratitude 

of our hearts for his mercies and blessings unto us in 

preserving our lives giving us power to build the 

Temple thus far. Prayed that the Saints might have 

power to finish the Temple according to the Patern 

given, and accepted at their hands, that the Saints 

might recieve their endowment, and be prepared to 

plant the work of God in all the world. I asked



 END_ENTRY my heavenly father in the name of Jesus Christ 

and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and the 

Keys of the kingdom of God that he would spedily 

avenge the blood of Joseph the Prophet Seer 

and Revelator, and Hiram the Patriarch, which 

had been shed by the hands of the American 

gentile nation, upon all the heads of the Nation and 

State that have aided, abeted or perpetrated the 

horid deed, of sheding the blood of those righteous 

men even the Lords anointed. I prayed that 

God would preserve our lives and enabled and

us to fill our mission in righteousness and be 

enabled to again return to this land and tread the 

courts of the Lords house in peace and recieve 

blessings at his hand. And that a double portion 

of the spirit of Josephs God might rest upon 

President Brigham Young and upon the quorum 

of the Twelve in connexion with him, that 

they may have power to bear off the keys of the 

kingdom of God in all the world, in righteous-

ness and truth according to the power of God. 

and that the work of the ministry, and Power 

of the Priesthood, may rest upon all the quorums of 

the Church and Elders of Israel. I dedicated myself 

my family, and all appertaining unto me, unto God 

committing my all into his hands, for the mission 

Praying for his blessing to rest upon me through 

the mission appointed unto me in the name 

of Jesus Christ Amen.



  

After Prayers we again desended to the ground 

returned to our homes with Joy and peace in 

our hearts

26th Aug 1843 The quorum of the Twelve 

met with the Saints in New York in conference

meeting opened by prayer President Young 

arose & addressed the meeting in an interesting 

manner upon the subject of the gathering, the 

building of the Nauvoo House & Temple. He spoke 

of the Priesthood & said that it was a perfect 

system of goverment and made many useful 

remarks.





In the afternoon the conference again 

met Prayr By Elder Page the meeting was addressed 

by Elder Kimball, spoke in parables, gather in the 

wheat and tares thrash the wheat & the mill will 

blow away the chaff &c Said an Elder would 

get a people together & could get the priest & 

people to receive the work if they did not whip 

the sect so like a shepherd who would call up a 

buck & a flock of sheep & hand them a little salt 

& Just as they begin to eat hit him with a club 

across the head & the sheep will run away.





Elder G. A. Smith followed & bore testimony of the 

work told several anecdotes one from Lyman Wight



 END_ENTRY said that a man told of a story so big about his 

Cheese house that a woman did not believ it & asked 

a servant if it was true. He said that his master 

did not let him go into the Cheese house but one thing 

he new that his master had a tremendous 

great Cheese house & a great mill of four run of 

stone that was carryed by the whay that runs 

from the Cheese house so let the Elders tel 

about the whey but not about what is in the 

Cheese house as long as they have not seen it 

let the misteries alone & speak of things that 

you understand. He spoke of his collegiate 

education he received from President Joseph 

Smith which was, to preach short sermans 

& make short prayers which had done him 

much good in life.





Elder B Young next spoke 

& made some useful remarks said the scriptures 

had been mistifyed to that degree that the greatest 

divine of the day is as ignorant as the dumm ass 

concerning the things of God they dont know their 

right hand from their left & we are trying to 

revere it to make it so simple that the people 

can understand it. Place a man in this room 

that is ignorant of science & take evry thing out 

that we can see & then ask him if their is 

any thing in the room, he says no nothing but

we two. I tel him that there is millions of live 

animals in the room even we breath them & I 

will show him by the aid of glasses that their 

is live animals in one drop of water eight feet long

but he dont believe it untill he sees it through 

glasses so with the unbeliever he does not 

believe in God, in Angels, in spirits because he 

cannot see them, but let him have spiritual 

glasses or obey the commandments of God &



 END_ENTRY get the spirit of God & then he can see & many 

other usful remarks he made. A Hymn was 

then sung. Then several questions were asked

1st Can any member officer in any branch 

of the church say their word is law & should 

be obayed (No) Is it right for an A priest to be 

joined to a Teacher to go & visit the houses of 

each member when their duty is set forth in 

the covenants. (Yes any members that are 

officers from High Priest to Deacon may visit 

the church or members & be set apart for this 

purpose if the Church will receive it)





[2] I instruction If Elders or High Priest are 

on an Island & cannot get word from the 

Prophet or the Twelve [they] may get a revelation 

concerning themselves, the Twelve may get 

a revelation in any part of the world concer-

ning the building up the kingdom as they have 

to esstablished the kingdom in all parts of the 

world, so any person can ask the Lord for a 

witness concerning himself he can get an answ

er to himself but not to lead the Church that 

Belongs to the head of the church





3rd Can a Church make buy laws as expediences 

for themselves that are not specifyed 

in any revelation (yes if they wish, they may 

make laws to stick their fingers in their eyes 

if they wish, but it is like sticking their finger 

through a not hole, in the wall to see what 

custom will do





4th When any person is ordained legally 

by the vote of the Church to any office can 

he be releaced from that office & priesthood 

(No) and hold his standing in the church (No) 

Elder young made many useful remark

conference adjourned untill tomorrow



 END_ENTRY August 27, 1843 ~ Sunday





27th Conference met at half past 10 oclock accor

ding to adjournment. meeting opened by singing

Prayer by Elder Grant. Meeting was then addressed 

by Elder W. Woodruff from 2nd Epistle of Peter 

1st ch 20, 21 verses. He remarked that if the prophe-

sies that had been fulfilled were fulfilled litterally 

in kike manner would those prophesies which 

are still to be fullfilled, be done litterally. And 

that the gathering of the Saints, the building of 

Zion, the gathering of the Jews, the rebuilding 

of Jerrusalem, the esstablishing of the Church 

& kingdom of God in the last days The preaching 

of the gospel to all the world was is an event looked 

for by the latter day Saints. & not withstanding 

these things are unpopular & not looked for or 

believed in by the world yet we feel incouraged 

to persevere & press forward in assisting to accom-

plish these great & glorious things with a firm 

belief that they will as truly be brought to pass 

and perfected as those things prophesied were in 

ancient days. He also bore testimony of the 

Truth of the Book of Mormon, covenants, & a 

prophet of God.



 

Elder Kimball followed & 

made some appropriate remarks, when the 

meeting adjourned two hourse.



 

Elder J. E. Page 

addressed the meeting in the afternoon, on the 

testimony of the Book of the Book of Mormon & 

that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. He quoted 

to many passages in the doctrins & covenants & 

Book of Mormon that prophesied of things that 

should take place which had actually come to 

pass according to the prophesies. He spoke quite 

lengthy upon the subject & brought much 

testimony to proove the truth of the position 

he had taken. At the close of his discourse 

some Church business was attended to as 

Elder L. R. Foster was about to go to Nauvoo 

It was necessary that another should be appointed 

in his stead to preside in New York



 END_ENTRY A vote was call to know if they ^the Church^ was perfectly 

satisfyed with Elders Foster's labours & procedings 

as Presiding Elder in the Church; the vote was 

Unanimous. Elder Foster resigned his office & 

Elder ^Geoe L Seach^ was appointed president 

of the Church in New York by a vot of the same 

After which several children were blessed & the 

meeting adjourned untill evening; At which time 

Elder O. Pratt addressed the people concerning 

the Book of Mormon. He spoke in an edifying 

manner concerning the Book of Mormon its 

history what it was &c that it was a history of 

nearly one half of the globe & the people that 

inhabited it, that it gave a history of all those 

cities that have been of late discoverd by Carthe-

-rwood's & Stephens, that it named those cities 

That it spoke of the esstablishing of our goverm-

ent & what is more highly interesting it reveals 

its final fate & destiny, so that by reading the 

Book of mormon you can clearly see what will 

befal this nation, and what will be its final end. 

In that Book you will find recorded the pure 

principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught 

by himself on the Continant of America so plain 

that no two persons could disagree as to the points 

of doctrin set forth, many interesting remarks 

he made upon this subject then bore testimony 

of the truth of Joseph Smith sen [jr.] being a true 

Prophet of God & that the Book of Mormon was 

true & that the Church of the Latter day saints 

was the true church of God, & after finishing his 

testimony he commenced and preached another 

sermon & spoke in all a little short of two 

hours, after he closed we blessed 5 children

 END_ENTRY Elder P. P. Pratt arose and remarked that 

some tell us that they have taught the gathering 

according to the scriptures, but to teach the 

gathering from the scriptures alone is not 

sufficient for by this they would be left in 

doubt they would not know whether to 

gather to Jerrusalem to Africa or America.

It is right to teach ^the gathering^ according to the scripturs 

but we are not left to this alone, we know & 

all the Saints aught to know that God has 

pointed out a place & time of gathering and 

has raised up a Prophet to bring it about of 

which we are witnesses, we have not got to go 

a long round about the time & place is pointed 

out the foundations of the City & Templ laid 

and a people already gatherd & we know to have 

to go, & to reject the revelations of God that have 

pointed out these things to us ownly brings condem

nations, & if this is not the case then our faith 

is vain & our works & hopes are vain also

we have already got the opinions of men enough 

concerning the coming of Jesus Christ. But 

we need the voice of a Prophet in such a case 

& we have it & I am willing to risk my all 

upon it. And if the Elders understand the 

principal of gathering and teach it correctly 

the people would have the correct spirit of gathering.





E. P. Magin arose & said he made the remark 

that he had made taught the gathering according 

to the scriptures. But he considerd all modern 

revelations scripture as well as those given 

anciently. P. P. Pratt sayed they agreed 

their was no disagreement &c



 END_ENTRY Elder B. Young arose & said, he wished to 

make a few general remarks concerning the 

subject of our faith we hear the Elders 

represent the feelings of the Brethren concerning 

the gathering. The spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ 

is a gathering spirit & the its tendency is to gather 

the virtuous & good the honest & meek of the 

earth, & in fine the saints of God. The time has 

come when the Lord is determin to fullfill his 

purpose. Had we lived in the days of Jesus Christ 

we would say we would receive his work. But 

Judge ye if the people are better now than then

they are not. When the full set time is come 

the Lord came in the flesh to do his work whether 

the people were prepared or not. And now the full 

set time is come for the Lord God Almighty to set 

his hand to redeem Israel we are not bound to 

make the people believe but to preach the gospel & 

then our garments are clear. The Lord does not 

require evry soul to leave his home as soon as he 

believes but he requirs him to harken to council & 

follow that course that the lord points out, the 

spirit of the Lord & this work is on the elect, and 

those that keep up with the work must be on 

the alert also. When the Lord says gather 

yourselves together why do you ask the Lord what 

for, is it not the principle of the Saints to mingle 

together to promote the great cause in which we 

are engaged. Say you cannot the Lord save 

us as well whare we are as to gather together. Yes 

if the Lord sayes so but if he commands us to 

come out & gather together, He will not save us 

by staying at home. Have you not received the 

gospel yes, then do you believe the gospel what 

we say. Have you not received the Holy Ghost



 END_ENTRY By receiving the gospel which we have brought 

unto you, yes & thousands have & it stands as a 

testimony that God has got a Prophet on the 

earth, you might have been baptized seventy 

times seven in any way except the way God had 

ordained and pointed out & you would not have 

received the Holy Ghost, this also is a 

testimony to you. Are ye ingaged in the great 

work with us ye will say yes, can ye do 

any good? yes ye can. The sectarian world 

send the Bible to the nations of the earth, the 

people put in sixpence fifty cts or a dollar into 

the box & send Bibles through the world.

Then cannot we do sumthing yes, the Lord 

requires us to build a house unto his name 

that the ordinances & blessings of his kingdom 

may be revealed & that the Elders may be 

endowed & go forth & gather together the blood 

of Ephraim the people of God from the ends of 

the earth. Can you get an endowment in Boston

No & ownly in that place that God has pointed 

out. Now query could moses have got the law had 

he staid in the midst of the children of Israel had 

he not gone to the mountains? The Lord says 

go & do so & so stand before Phario, pull off your 

shoes for the ground is Holy &c. Moses obeyed 

& obtained blessings, but if he had not obeyed 

he would not have obtained the blessing. But why 

query about it has the Lord spoken yes then 

this is enough. I do not care whether the people 

gather or not if they dont want to, I do not wish 

to save the people against their will, I wish you 

to have your choice either to gather with the 

righteous or stay with the wicked, I would like 

to have all people bow down to the Lord Jesus Christ 

but it is one of the decrees of the Lord that all



 END_ENTRY persons shall act upon their agency, which 

was the case even with the angels that fell 

from heaven.





Now will you help us 

to build the Nauvoo House & Temple if so you 

will be blessed if not we will build it alone

And if you dont harken you will not have 

the spirit of the Lord, for the spirit of the 

Lord is on the moove. The Apostles tried to 

gather the people together in their day. Christ said he 

would gather the Jews oft as a hen gathereth her 

chickens under her wings but they would not

God and Angels dont care whether men hear or forbear

they will carry on their work for the full set 

time is come and we care about it we must 

build a house & get an endowment & preach the 

gospel, warn the people, gather the Saints, build 

up Zion & finish our work & be prepared for 

the Coming of Christ. Now we want to send 

missionaries to the Islands can you do sumthing

for them & that is not all we want you to 

do we want you to give us sumthing to build 

a temple we want what you have to spare. 

But are you afraid that you will not have 

Enough for youself when you get there. But 

how easy it is for the Lord to take it away from 

you by fire & otherwise. E P Magin had an ^Ivory^ cane

I asked him for it but he din give it to me but 

he soon lost it & it did neither of us any good

But the Lord can give & take away. Jacob with 

his faith obtained all the best cattle that his 

Father in law had. Who blesses you and all the 

people God, but do the people acknowledge the hand 

of God in all these things No, they turn away 

from him & do not acknowledge him or realize 

from whom their blessings flow. Let me tell 

you a secret when the Lord shakes the earth



 END_ENTRY And the Hills fall down & vallies are exhalted 

then for brass the Lord will bring gold for Iron 

silver for stones Iron &c, then you will have 

no use for gold, for money & gods as you now 

have but the Lord will think as much of it 

then as now. Let us have some of your gold 

to take to Nauvoo to make a temple & Nauvoo,

House so that when the Kings Princes & Nobles 

of the earth call at Nauvoo to enquire after 

the wisdom of Zion that they may have a place 

to entertain them, & that the weary travellor may 

be refreshed, is their wisdom in Zion, we 

think so & the world begin to think so, let the 

world come forward & translate the plates that 

have of late come forth, if they have wisdom 

to do it. The Lord intends to take away the gods 

of the gods of the gentiles the Lord pulleth down 

& buildeth up at his own pleasure dont be afraid 

of a dollar a hundred or a thousand dollars I 

would not I have made a sacrafice a good many 

times, the Lord has promised a hundred fold & 

I have taken this course to get rich, to give all 

I had & God has given many blessings in consequ

ence. If I have been to bold in asking, then be 

to bold in giving give your all and God will repay 

as much again adjurned untill half past 2 oclok





Met according to adjournment meeting opened by 

singing & Prayer By Elder P. P. Pratt who arose 

and said I have a few remarks to make concerning 

the subject spoken of in the fornoon by Elder 

B. Young who said your all we wanted all 

your gold silver & precious things &c we 

not ownly want your all as pertains to gold 

silver &c but we want you, your wives &



 END_ENTRY Children, & all you have. I dont know that 

I can give you a better pattern of what we want 

than the case of Joseph in Egypt. An Israel-

ite will get all he can, they are vary great to 

go ahead. The Egyptians believed in dreams 

& by this peculiar gift Joseph entered into a great 

scheme of speculation, he used the gift of dreams 

to become great in the eyes of the Egyptians, 

had great political influence came out on the kings 

horse in great splendor, & lade up corn in great 

abundance during the seven years Plenty & in time 

of famine got all the gold, silver, cattle property 

their own persons, this speculation was from 

a Josephite and it was like an Israelite, it was 

like Noah, Lot, Christ, &c & it is a fair sample of 

our speculation. God is the origin of Power 

the Sovreign, & he has a right to reign, & their 

will be good times & goverment when the world 

will acknowledge the God of heaven their lawgiver 

& If I could live under his goverment I should 

be thankful, then our prayer would be answered 

may thy kingdom come &c untill that time we 

must pray for it. This Joseph in Egypt the 

speculator what a great & good man he was I

love him I admire his course, & I believe a little 

of his blood is in my veins. But had Joseph 

been like the religious world at the present day he 

would not have rode the kings horse & wore his 

robe & had nothing to do with gold & silver, & do no 

good, save no corn, build no store houses, do none 

of these things for fear of speculation. But He done 

differently. And their is a prophesy about the modern 

Prophet Joseph, being raised & supported by the power 

of God to do a work on the earth. And he has been 

raised up & the Lord has been with him & evry



 END_ENTRY formed against him has been broaken. He 

has had rising of thirty law suits to pass 

through & yet he has overcome & no accusation 

has been susstained against him, but he will 

lay a plan to speculate as large as Ancient Joseph 

did, what Elder Young said is good, and even 

now we want you to take that course that 

will save you. Build up a city & Temples & 

enjoy them & do as the Lord tells you & harken 

to Council. we have a prophet to tell us what to 

do, and we should get as much wisdom as the 

world, if the world want a rail road built all 

they have to do is to open books the people 

subscribe stock & a rail road is soon built & an 

income is brought. And the Saints ought to 

be as well united as the world, & do the things 

that God has required, that a great nation may 

be saved from all Nations. The old gentleman 

that rules the nations has ruled long enough 

and if I was an Infidel I would like to have 

the Lord raise up a Joseph or Daniel or sumbod

to raise up a change for the good of the world

and thank Heaven he has begun to raise them 

up to do the great work of God & it will continue 

untill the saying goes forth that the Lord 

has built up Zion. I read that Gold, silver, power 

thrones & dominions will be connected with the 

great work of God in the last days, then let us 

wake up and enlarge our hearts & prepare for 

the great & glorious work, does the Saints here 

in Boston know that they are Identifyed 

with laying the foundation of a great & mighty 

work that is to enclude all the great and 

glorious work that is to be fulfilled in the last 

dispensation & fulness of times And



 END_ENTRY And I Prophecy in the name of the Lord 

that whether Boston Saints or who may stand 

for it or rise against it that almost numberless 

milions will selebrate that day when the founda-

tion of this work was laid.





G A Smith arose and said that he was pleased 

with the many remarks that had been made 

this day you can see a similarity between the 

two Josephs & the Laws that were given. Says 

one who believes that God who dwells in heaven 

will speak about building a house &c in this day 

of religion & science. But the day was when the salv-

ation or damnation of a whole world hung upon 

a small circumstance even in the days of Noah the 

building of an ark, had the Editors of this day 

lived then I think they would have said and 

written more against it than they have against 

Joseph Smiths Revelations. You talk about God 

condesending to speak of small things in the last 

days but no more so than it was in the days 

of Moses for we read in the bible how God comm-

anded the Children of Israel when they found 

a birds nest to take the young to themselves but 

to let the dam go free, what for, wy that their 

days might de [be] long in the land which their God the 

Lord their God giveth them, so come to the point 

it was a great thing at last. Yet connecting this with 

the word of the Lord concerning eating beetles & 

grashoppers was as small business for the Lord to 

talk about as it was for the Lord to command 

the Saints to build a tavern. This boarding 

house when done will do much good for 

the spreading of the work to all nations. But 

what good could arise from eating beetles & grasshopers 

I cannot say



 END_ENTRY in the midst of one universal dens mass [o]f brick & Stone

buildings, covering about six miles squair of ground

while viewing this scenery in a clear day we were 

conversing with a Prussian traveller (citizen of Berlin)

who had travled much over Europe & Asia & other 

parts of the world, & he declaired we could not 

find another spot upon the face of the earth that 

would present to our view as grand a scenery as 

the one before us. This monument was 24 feet higher 

than Trajan's Pillar at Rome. This pillar cost £14,500 

or $75,500 dollars. The following is inscribed upon 

one side of the monument in LATIN



In the year of Christ 1666 the second 

day of September from hence at the distance of two hund

red & two feet the hight of this column about midnight 

a most terrible fire broke out which driven on by a high 

wind not ownly wasted the adjacent parts but also places vary

remote with incredible noise & fury. It consumed 89

Churches, the gates of the city Guild hall many public struc-

tures, hospitals, schools, libraries a vast number of Stately

edifices. 13,200 dwelling houses 400 streets of 26 wards

it utterly destroyed 15 & left 8 others shattered & half 

burnt. The ruins of the city were 436 acres from the 

Tower by the Thames side to the Temple Church & 

from the North east Gate along the city wall to Holborn 

Bridge. To the estates & fortunes of the citizens it 

was merciless but to their lives vary favorable (ownly

eight being lost). That it might in all things resemble the 

last conflog^r^ation of the world. The destruction 

was sudden for in a small space of time the same 

city was seen most flourishing & reduced to 

nothing three days after when the fatal fire 

had Baffled all human councils & endeavours, 

the opinion of all, as it were, by the will of heaven

it stoped & on evry side was extinguished past

Rev Mr A^it^ken preach 2 sermons he i[s] a talented man 

has come out against the sexts & established chu

rches of his own but he has got as far as he can & knows 

not what to do, sumthing like the followers of A 

Campbell in America. In fine the whole sectarian 

world is in confusion & trouble & knows not what 

to do. Mr Akens said in his sermon said that the gentils 

with all their present glory would soon be glad to take 

hold of the skirt of a Jew & say let us go with you 

he also says that most are ignorant of the meaning & 

fulfillment of the Bible & will remain so untill it 

is revealed by the spirit of God. but notwithstanding 

Mr Akins has sum sublime truths yet he is building a great 

house without any foundation by rejecting the 

first principles of the gospel. We also attended 

meeting at Zions Chapel Waterloo Road & herd 

Mr Robert Aitken deliver an interesting warning 

to the gentiles in the evening, he presented some 

of the most sublime truths that I ever herd delivered 

by a sectarian priest. also he whiped the present 

religionist of the day at a tremendious rate, he said 

they would go to Hell as a body for their religion was 

ownly a cloke to cover adulterers & evry evil work 

he said the judgments of God would spedily overtake 

them. he prophesied of many judgments that would 

spedily come, he wept over the present state of

[FIGURE] I wrote a letter to Elders Young & Richards

we visited St Pauls Cathedral & went all through 

the lower court & could see the splender of most of 

it. It is the largest & most splended & expensive Church



 END_ENTRY in the world at the present time excepting the Vatican ^Church^ 

at Rome dedicated St Peter. It is 500 feet long from E to W. 

& 285 wide from N to S. & 404 fet. high 

& it contains 47 monuments of fine marble erected 

over the tombs of certain Lords, Bishops, Generals, Earls 

& other Titles who have distinguish themselves in the 

military service of Great Britiain & otherwise Lord 

Nelsons Monument is the largest & most noted. their 

Bodies are placed in vaults under the building & their 

monuments mostly erected on the floor above. This 

Cathedral bears up three lofty Spires & the whole 

Building is splended inside & out. It was first built 

by St Augustine in the year 610. It was destroyed 

by fire in 961 & rebuilt the following year. It was 

not till the reign of Athelstan that London became 

the metropolis of England & it was to this prince more 

perhaps than to any of his predecessors that the cath

edral of St Paul was indebted for its permanant esta-

blishment & preeminance. In 1086 this cathedral was 

again destroyed by fire which also involved the greater 

part of the Metropolis in ruin. Maurice who was then 

Bishop of London had been chaplain & chancellor to 

King William conceived (Says Stow) the vast design 

of erecting the magnificent structure which immediately 

preceded the present Cathedral which was sufficiently 

erected by 1099 to admit of public worship. But It was 

againe partly Burned in 1132 & again in 1135–6 it sus-

tained considerably injury, the central tower was comple

ted in 1221, & they continued to add unto it from time 

to time. The lofty Spire of the Cathedral was fired 

by lightning in 1444, & not repaired till 1462, in June 

1561 the spire was again set on fire which destroyed 

spire & roof, & Queen Elizabeth commenced to repair 

it which was afterwards accomplished by Laud & 

King Charles the first who expended £104,330. 4s. 8 p.

but Immediately dissentions arose between the King & 

Parliment, & the whole cathedral suffered beyound any 

former example. the revenues of the church was confisc

ated, the money & materials siezed by the parliment 

& the whole dody of the buidding was converted into 

Stables & Barracks for draggoons &c But It was 

again repaired [during] the reign of Charles the Second but It was 

not finished before it became a pray to the flames in the 

great fire of London in 1666 which desolated the 

Chief part of the Metropolis the above is a brief history 

of St Pauls Church untill 1666, END_ENTRY The now present building or new Cathedral was 

built under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren 

the first stone was laid on the 21st of June 1675 & 

the highest stone of the pile was laid at the top of the 

lantern by Mr Christopher Wren the son of the Architect 

in the year 1710. & the last finishing & adorning the 

Church was Issued in 1715 by George the first 

the whole expens of erecting this magnificent structure 

was about £736,000 ^£1,576,076 15.s^ or $3,680,000 or $5,880,380

entire dimentions, Length of the church from east to west 

is 500. the breadth of the body of the Church is 285 feet 

the hight from the pavement in the street to the top of the 

Cross over the Dome is 404 feet. Two campanile 

towers at the west end are each 222 in highth the 

general highth of the wall is about 90 feet. It was 

40 years in building commenced 1675 ended 1715

It covers over two (English) acres of ground)

I again visited this Cathedral on the 7th of Sept & 

I visited evry part of it from the lower floor to

the City of London to see if we could find any 

man that had the Spirit of God & after wander

ing several miles through the City not knowing 

whether we went we came to an Ephraimite



 END_ENTRY walking in the Street we steped up to him & spoke 

to him though It was the first time we had ever seen

30th Sunday FIRST FOUNDATION OF THE 

FULNESS OF THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL

IN THE CITY OF LONDON

We having spent 12 days going to & fro through



 END_ENTRY the City of London to try to find a people that 

were willing to receive our testimony & obey the

fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ but finding 

evry door shut against us we were now determin

ed in the name God to go into the Streets & lift 

up our voice & warn the people accordingly Elders 

Kimball, Smith, & myself, walked 3 miles into the 

City, & stoped in Tabernacle Square Old Street road

here we found a man preaching to the people of the 

Aitken Society & when he closed another man got 

into the chair to preach belonging to the Calvinest or

Presbyterians & Just as he was about to speak Elder 

Kimball informed him that there was a preacher 

from America present who would like to speak when 

he got through The preacher then informed the peo-

ple that there was an American Preacher present &

he proposed for him to speak first Elder G. A. Smith

then got into the chair & spoke about 20 minutes & 

was followed dy the other Preacher. Elder Smith

informed the people that there was two other Amer-

ican preachers present that would address them

if they had an oppertunity & when the Calvenist

preacher closed, Elder Kimball asked him if there 

would be any objection to our preaching there at 3

oclock he says No not all. What denomination do 

you belong to? to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter

Day Saints, O I have herd of them, they are a bad 

people, they have done much hurt, they divide Churches

we dont want to hear you. He then got up into his 

chair & said to the people I have just herd that the 

last man that spoke belongs to the latter Day Saint 

& he spoke all manner of evil of us, & scandalized 

us before the people without hearing us ^or^ knowing

any thing about our principles. Elder Kimball then 

asked him to let him step into the chair & give out

the appointment for a 3 oclock meeting but he would 

not let him & Just as he went to step into the chair 

another preacher of the Same order ketched up the 

chair & run away with it Elder Kimball then rais

ed his voice & informed the people, that some Amer-

ican Preachers would preach there at 3 oclock at

which time we were all three of us on the Spot, & 

the conduct of the Preacher & the excitement upon 

the subject brought a large congregation together I 

opened the meeting by singing, & prayer & spoke abou[t]

30 minutes from Gal 1, 8, 9, upon the first principles of

the gospel. I was then followed by Elder Kimball who



 END_ENTRY spoke about the Same length of time the people gave

good attention to what we said & seemed to be much

interested in what they heard, & we dismissed our 

meeting in the midst of good feelings. Mr Corner invited 

us home, soon after we arived at his house Elder

Kimball felt impressed to returned Back to the place 

of preaching, & when he got there he found a

large company talking about the things which they 

had herd, & they wished him to speak to them again 

& he did so & spoke lengthy & several invited him

home, and while he was there, a man that was a 

preacher came to Mr Corners whare Br Smith & I 

was & I gave them a brief account of the great

work which God was doing in these last days & they 

received the things which I spoke unto them & Mr 

Corner offered himself for Baptism which is the 

first man that has offered himself for Baptism in

the City of London to us we appointed next evening 

to administer the ordinance unto him & his houshold

or as many as would receive it we took supper 

with him & returned home by the way of London 

Bridge the whole Bridge & streets was covered with 

people so thick that a person could scearcely get along

I returned home weary & spent the night at our 

logings But was unwell through the night with the

Bowel Complaint. But I felt thankful to God for 

his mercies unto us for giving us the privilege 

of preaching once to the people of London & of having

one soul as a seal of our ministry 7 miles





August 31, 1840 ~ Monday





31st We walked into the City & Called upon 

Mr Corner 52 Iron monger row, St Luke parish

While on our way we received a letter from 

Sister Eliza Bromley she stated she had a dream 

that we should soon Baptize a man that would 

do much good, after reading the letter & ariving

at Mr Corners, he went forward with us to a

public Bath & was Baptized under the hands of

Elder Kimball, & after returning to his house we 

all three laid our hands upon him & confirmed

him which is the first man that has receved the

work in the City of London as a seal of our

ministry. We returned home & felt to thank 

God for his goodness in giving us one Soul. his 

wife manifested much interest in the work & 

thinks of Being Baptized soon. Brother Corner 

has been a watch maker nearly all his life 7 m

Sept 1.st I walked out in the after noon with

Elders Smith & Kimball to visit some of the great 

works of man, we visited the Thames Tunnel 

which is considered one of the greatest wonders 

of the world. We entered the Tunnel on the 

South Side of the river Thames at Rotherhithe

& after going about about 80 feet down into the 

earth we entered the archway on the left which 

was finished 1120 feet which was beatifully 

lighted up with gas we walked through it under the 

river Thames, with the river & Shiping over our 

heads & in some places not more than 15 feet betw

een the top of the arch & the bed of the river there 

is two archways the whole length of the tunnel &

openings which afford free communication from one

archway to the other, this is considered the greatest

Piece of Invention & most splended work ever acc

omplished by man in modern times. We wrote our 

names & profession & residence in a record about und

er the centre of the river we then came out of 

the Tunnel, & rode in a skiff 2 miles to the Tower 

of London which was built by the romans but is now 

occupied for the garrison armory & Jewelry of the 

British Navy & army &c we did not spend much time

it visiting this for it was late & we could not go thr

ough the different appartments on our return home

2nd I arose quite Ill with my complaint spent the

day mostly to my room. Elders Kimball & Smith went 

in to the city to visit the people found some that 

harkened to their testimony. London is the hardest 

place I ever visited for esstablishing the gospel. It

is full of evry thing but righteousness, but we do 

not feel discouraged in the least we are determined 

in the name of the Lord to set up the Standard of truth

in this city & to seek out the honest in heart & the

meek from among men & warn all as far as in our 

power that the world may be left without excuse

September 4, 1840 ~ Friday





4th Elders Kimball & Smith took a walk to Debt

ford, & I took a walk into the city called upon

Br Corner found him in good Spirits. I also called 

upon A Mr Panther 17 Wharf City road Basin, as he

was a directer of a Methedist Chapel I asked him for 

it to preach in, he said he had a School house that

would hold about 500 he said I might have that 

on Sunday & he would give up his Chool for that,

purpose So I gave out an appointment at Bowl 

Court 137 Thornditch. I conversed with several 

others who received my testimony one woman said

she would be baptized. I returned home by the way 

of the Smithfield Market which occipies about 20 

acres of ground, & it was in the time of the fair

& I never saw such a scenery before. In fact 

it would be a difficult task for a historian to descr

ibe the particulars of 20 acres of ground covered 

over with Cattle, Sheep, Caravans of Beast, Lions

Tigers Leapard Bears, Wolves, Elephants Camels Zabras

horned horses, wild Boars, monkeys, serpants, & evry

description of beasts, Animal & reptile exhibited in Euro-

pe. these connected with large bands of music. men 

woman, & children of almost evry grade & rank

prostitutes & merchantdize of evry name & nature

Oshters, Shrimps, mustles, crabs, lobsters fish, cakes

bread, meet, beer, soda, crockery toys clothing of all 

kinds old & new, umbrellas, pears, Apples, plums, &

grapes & almost evry thing els that anybody ever 

saw. A Giant women was exhibited 7 feet high

a sheep weighing 600 lbs. & a live serpent 12

feet in length which a women would wind around

her bare neck & bosom to show her courage &c. 

Should a Missourian from the western wiles of 

America whose knowledge extends ownly to his 

gun, corn crib & hog pen behold such a scenery

he would think he was in another world, what

affect it would have upon him I know not but 

one thing is certain that any man that loved 

virtue peace & retirement would turn from 

such a scenery with his heart sicken within him 

knowing that virtue peace nor righteousness could 

not long dwell in such a sink of confusion & 

iniquity 8 m

Sept 5th [FIGURE] Elders Kimball, Smith, & myself

Visited Westminster Abbey 

& went through evry appartme

Kings, Queens, Princes, Lords, & noted men that have 

ever been entombed within its walls one part of 

the Abbey was built in the year 600 having stood 

over 1200 years most all of the Kings & Queens of

England are in this Abbey that have died for the 

last 1200 years we saw the perfect likenes of Queen 

Elizabeth, Mary, & Ann, Lord Nelson, & Pitt & others

we saw the full Coronation dress of Queen Ann. We

saw the chair & sat in it in which Queen Victoria 

was crowned & all the kings & Queens for the last

800 years, this chair is covered with gold tissue It 

contains a stone under the seat upon which all the

Scottish chiefs & kings were crowned since they wer a

people it is reported to be Jacobs pillar this chair has 

been in use more than 800 years. This Abbey is

composed of Eleven Chapels (ownly seperated by walls or petitions) 

viz St Benedict. St Edmund. St Nicholas. Henry the Seventh

St Paul. St Edward the Confess. St Erasmus. Abbot Islip.

St John. St Andrew. And St Michael. & these Chapels 

contain the bodies, tombs & monuments of 13 Kings viz

O. Cromwell in defacing some of the tombs, monuments & brass

work with which some of the Abbey was adorned. Here we beho

preached in the street & I followed them in 

Bearing testimony one man arose & opposed us & 

was angry becaus of the truth of God, & conti

nued opposing untill the conversation was stoped 

by the Police. We met again in the evening at 

Bowl Court to preach to the people as we had an 

appointments But when we got there, we found 

a plan contrived by several of the preachers for 

one of them to preach lest some of the peopl would 

believe our doctrin & when we saw this we went 

our way, & found four other persons that received 

our testimony & offered themselves for Baptism 10 m

7th [FIGURE] I wrote a letter to Elder Browett &

walked to Br Corners & visited several 

other friends. {Brother Corner would make me a [illegible] watch for} 5 10

two offered themselves for Baptism. On 

my return home I passed through Smithfield

market & it was fare time with them & such a 

scenery I never saw before I visited St Pauls Church 

or Cathedral after visiting the lower room which 

we visited on the 24th Aug. I then walked on circular 

stairs into the whispering gallery which is round & 

exceding large & a person can hear a whisper distinctly 

from any part of it. I nex visited the Cupola 

& all parts above it untill I got to the ^[FIGURE]^ I then went in to 

the top of the Brass ball upon which the cross stand whic 

is as high as any man can go It brought me 400 feet 

in the air over the city. I wrote my name & returned to the Earth

On ariving at our boarding hours I found Elder 

Kimball & Smith who had just returned from 

a visit with the Rev. R. Aitken A.M. he 

treated them kindly acknowledged their doctrin 

to be true but was afraid of deception his 

mind is in a disturbed state.





We held a meeting 

in the Temperance hall in the evening which 

was well lighted with gas But we had almost 

bear walls to preach to as their was ownly 

about 30 persons present. The truth is the 

minds of the people here in London are taken up 

with evry thing but the things of God & righteous

ness. I preached to the people about one hour 

& was followed by Elder Kimball. after paying 

7/6 for the use of the Hall we returned to our lodgings.

together & walked up king & Union Street. passed by 

surry Chapel. Built & occupied for many years by 

the Celebrated Rev Rowland Hill, whose body now 

lies under the Chapel from thence we continued 

west to West minster Bridge which we walked over 

which brought us direct to West minster Abbey 

& to the house of parliment. we walk through the 

house of Commons & of Lords We sat in the Chair 

whare the speaker of the house of Lords had sat 

for many years. In this room all the speaches were 

made by Mr William Pitt concerning America before 

the Revolution. In this room all the laws were 

made that ha now governs from 172,452,000 

to 200,000,000 of human beings. As the house of 

Commons was burned down about 6 years since this 

room is now occipied by the house of Commons & 

there is annother house now built which the hous of 

Lords at the present time occupy. One would naturly 

suppose that a room fitted up to contain the hous of 

Lords of Commons would be sumthing extra, grand 

expensive & fine but it is not so but the revers it is 

exceding plain & undecorated. On entering the room 

one would sooner think he was in an American School 

house rather than in a house of Lords or of Commons

from this we visited St James Park, whare [we] saw the 

a company of 200 foot Soldiers or guards on parade 

accompanied by a full band of music. After which we 

saw the Queen's Horse guard on parrade one hun

dred in number with there bodies covered with Steel 

which glissened much in the sun they were all 

mounted upon Black mares which were fast & gay

had the privilege of seeing his Royal Highness 

PRINCE ALBERT While he rode from his 

Palace across St James Park he was mounted 

on a gray horse was followed by his groom 

on a sorrel horse. He was not accompanied by 

her Magesty Victoria or any other person except 

his groom, he was dressed in a frock coat & 

dark pantloons, he looks well fresh & healthy 

& in the bloom of life as he is but about 20 years 

of age. I did not see her majesty as she was at 

Winsor at the present time. I also visited the 

National Gallery, & saw all the paintings which 

the nations has gathered together which are consi

dered the most sublime of any in the world

after leaving the gallery & visiting St Martins 

Church, I though[t] I had seen as much as my brain 

would contain in one day. I then walked about 3

15th[FIGURE] I walked from Turkey Hall to forty Green

I wrote a letter to Lady Roberts a companion to 

Lady Dowdswell, & sent it to her by the hand of Sister 

Brooks. Lady Roberts is of the Nobility, a Lady of 

wealth, of Rank, has at her command the Languages 

has withdrawn from the Church of England & has travled 

much in search of truth, & looking for the fulfillment 

of the ancient Prophets, she became acquainted with

the fulness of the gospel through a female servent 

in the employ of Square Dowdswell which I had Baptized 

& as soon as she began to investigtate the subject 

the Spirit of God rested upon her & convinced her of the 

truth of the work & she obtained the four number 

of the Millennial Star which we had printed & fearing 

she should not be able to obtain them she copied the

whole of them of with her pen She red the Book of mormon 

& Coppied a part of that in the same manner She 

became perfectly convinced of the truth of the work 

& said she would go a thousand miles but what she 

would see some of the Twelve & be Baptized under 

their hands & hearing that I was in London she was



 END_ENTRY about to take a Journey there to see me & the other 

Brethren & Be baptized. She will not inform any of  

her relatives or rank of her intentions untill she is 

Baptized thinking she will then have more power 

to commence her testimony & warning among those sitting 

in high Places. She has two Brothers ministers of the 

Church of England. After sending her an address by 

letter, She returned me a virble answer by Sister 

Brooks thanking me kindly for the interest I manifested in 

her welfare, saying she should address me by letter in 

few days. I then walked to Haw Cross & preached & 

spent the night at Br Smiths 5 miles

the inhabitants of Dymock & had gathered together about 

50 Saints which had much stired up the people to anger 

against the saints esspecially Mr John Simons the 

Rector of the Church in Dymock manifested much of 

the Spirit of the Devil by stiring up mobs against 

the Saints which had disturbed the meetings of the 

Saints in several instances, & on this occasion as we 

began to gather together, the beat of drums, pails, pans, 

& sticks, was herd through the Street, & the mob soon 

Collected & Parraded in the Streets in front of the house 

we closed the window shutters & doors in the room 

whare we ware, & I opened meeting by Singing & 

Prayer & no sooner had we commenced than the mob 

armed themselves with eggs, Bricks, rocks, & evry thing 

els they could lay their hands upon & began to throw 

them upon the house like a shower of hail Stones for 

nearly an hour they dashed in the windows scattered 

Stones, Brick, & glass, through the rooms, broke the tile 

on the rooff & continued such depredations untill 

the close of the meeting & the Brethren feeling 

disposed to try what virtue their was in the English

laws which were strict against such procedings 

I proposed to accompanied them to go into the midst 

of the mob to se who they were that there might be 

testimony against them. But they would not permit 

me to go with them lest I should receive an injury from 

the shower of stones but several of the Brethren went 

themselfs into the midst of the mob & took the name 

of the leaders & returned to the house in the midst of 

Stones, & Brick bats, though without Injury the mob

the brethren to be faithful and diligent in keeping all of 

the commandments of God and in hearkening to the council 

of those who are sent to council them. Let no man 

or set of men think they have Power or authority of

the Keys of the kingdom above the Apostle Wilford Woodruff 

whom we send unto you to instruct you in the things 

pertaining to life and salvation; Though our prophet 

be slain for the word of God and the testimony of 

Jesus, yet the keys of the Kingdom remain in the 

Church and the heavens are not closed neither is

the mouth of the Almighty closed up sealed up that 

he cannot speak. The God of Israel will communicate

to his disciples from time to time all things necessary 

for the building up of his kingdom upon the earth 

untill Israel is gathered, yea even all the blood of 

Abraham scattered over all the earth. Zion established,

Jerrusalem rebuilt, and the whole earth be filled with 

the glory and knowledge of God. We wish all the 

Saints in England to continue their gathering as usual to 

the land of America and they may have the Privilege 

of appointing a committee to visit the land of America 

to prepare a location for a settlement of the brethren

a book entitled the History of the Welch baptist

published in Pittsburg, Professing to trace their origin 

to John the baptist. It contains many interesting items 

of history, but their is one trait in it the same as in 

evry history published since the days of Christ and 

the Apostles, (except what has been published by the latter

Day Saints) ie they are all alike rob[b]ed of apostolic purity 

religion, order, ordinances, Holy Ghost, gifts, grace, miricles

Prophets Revelations, all of one accord cry out these 

things are done away, but they are ownly done away 

through their unbelief, making void the law of God 

changing the ordinances breaking the everlasting 

covenant departing from the apostolic order of things)

through the day and evening untill 12 oclk

at night a strong wind arose, the Lake 

was rough the boat rocked badly and in 

the midst of it opposite the Cleveland lighthouse 

at midnight the cry of fire, fire, fire, was rung 

through through the boat by the watch on duty

we immediately leaped from our beds in our

night cloths and each one caught a bucket the best 

he could. I caught a bucket about half full of

water and run as I was barefoot to the stern of

the boat looking for the fire while some was

runing up stares I leaped into the engine room



 END_ENTRY And saw the fire in one cornor of the stern of the 

boat I run over the pile of coal and dashed my

water into the fire which was not larger than 

a half bushel measure, at the same time a bucket of 

water flung by Capt Davis struck the fire and it was 

instantly extinguished; Their is nothing more terrible or 

alarming than the cry of fire on board of a ship or 

steem boat at Sea or on any water out of reach

of Land, it is far more terrible than a storm or 

wreck, for when fire gets the control under such 

circumstances all hope is lost, and persons will plunge 

into the deep to escape its fury. but in this case the 

fire was out and the alarm over in the term of a 

minute. on my return to the cabin I found one

woman flung into convulsions with alarm. Mrs 

Woodruff was holding her in her arms she did not 

get over it untill the next day.

facts and documents relating to the Patriot war

now first given to the Public from the original

notes and Papers of Mr Wright and other sourses

by Caleb Lyon of Lyondale."



 

Among other things it gives an account of the execution 

in Canada of several brave men for taking an

active part in the Patriot war among which were

"Col Von Schoultz, Dorephus Abbey, Daniel George 

of watertown N.Y. And Col Martin Woodruff 

A deputy sheriff of Salina Onandagua Co N.Y.

with wounds beneath the Towers of Warsaw, his

son attained to the rank of col under Napolian 

and has been a residence in America several years 

took part in the Patriot war in Canada, being deserted 

by trators was hung by the british in Cannda."

I spent this NEW YEARS DAY in company 

with the quorum of the Twelve & with our wives 

in the city of Nauvoo at Br S. Stodard's

it was an interesting day unto us to once more 

assemble to a feast with our quorum & our families 

in a city of the Saints in the midst of peace & love 

we more highly prized this privilege as we are 

called to be seperate so much while in the vineyard 

of the Lord. We have been spared to commence 

annother new Year while many of our near & dear 

friends are dead [and] sleep in the grave. Whare the 

next new Year will find us the Lord ownly knoweth

I pray my Heavenly father in the name of Jesus 

Christ to keep us from evry vain speculation & evil 

& give us wisdom to govern us in all our temporal 

affairs as well as spiritual, that we may not run 

into any sins, evils or snares. It now seems to 

be my privilege & lot to spend a season at home & pro-

vide for my family it being the first time I have 

had the privilege since I have been in the Church as 

my lot has been cast in the vineyard most of the 

time for the last eight years. As we have now a 

commandment from the Lord resting upon us to 

build the temple of the Lord & the Nauvoo house it is

I received 3 papers from Mr Ezra Carter jr 

which contained much intelligence of various kinds



It is truly interesting edifying & glorious to conte-

mplate the great & mighty work which God has 

set his hand to esstablish in these last days by revealing 

the fullness of the everlasting gospel as recorded in 

the Book of mormon & esstablishing his church & END_ENTRY kingdom as at the beginning which is according to the 

order of heaven with seers prophets, Apostles, Elders 

Priests, Bishops, Teachers, Revelation, Administering 

of Angels gifts, graces, Knowledge, wisdom, tongues 

healings &c. &c. Truly the Lord has raised up Joseph 

the seer of the seed of Abraham out of the loins 

of ancient Joseph, & is now clothing him with mighty 

power & wisdom & knowledge which is more clear-

ly manifest & felt in the midst of his intimate friends

than any other class of mankind. The Lord is 

Blessing Joseph with Power to reveal the mysteries of 

the kingdom of God; to translate through the Urim 

& Thummim Ancient records & Hyeroglyphics as 

old as Abraham or Adam, which causes our 

hearts to burn within us while we behold their glori-

ous truths opened unto us. Joseph the Seer 

has presented us some of the Book of Abraham which 

was written by his own hand but hid from the 

knowledge of man for the last four thousand years but 

has now come to light through the mercy of God. 

Joseph has had these records in his possession for 

several years but has never presented them before 

the world in the english language untill now. But 

he is now about to publish it to the world or parts 

of it by publishing it in the Times & Seasons, for 

Joseph the Seer is now the Editor of that paper 

& Elder Taylor assists him in writing while it has fallen 

to my lot to take charge of the Business part of 

the esstablishment. I have had the privilege this day 

of assisting in setting the TIPE for printing 

the first peace of the BOOK OF ABRAHAM 

that is to be presented to the inhabitants of the 

EARTH in the LAST DAYS



My soul has been much edifyed of late from 

time to time in hearing Joseph the Seer convers 

about the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, truly 

GOD is with him & is making him mighty in wisdom 

& knowledge & I am convinced for myself that 

none of the Prophets Seers or Revelators of the Earth 

have ever accomplished a greater work than 

will be accomplished in the Last days through the 

mercy of God By JOSEPH THE SEER END_ENTRY February 20, 1842 ~ Sunday

After the business of the day was closed, I attend 

the trial of Elder Gladden F. Bishop at President Joseph Smith

set himself up as some great thing for 8 or 9 years 

& the church had been so much troubled with him 

by his foolish conduct that he had been cut off a num-

ber of times from the Church & restored, & he had 

now set himself up as a prophet & Revelator to the 

Church & a number of his revelations were brought 

forward & red before the congregations & it was 

the greatest Bundle of Nonsens ever put together it 

would have taken Gladden Bishop ten thousand Years 

to have accomplished the work which he said in 

his pretended revelations he should perform he took 

the name of God in vain & his crime was so 

great in his blaspheming God in his pretended revelations 

that Joseph the Seer said that nothing would 

excuse him in the sight of God & angels in commiting 

the unpardonable sin ownly because he was a 

fool & had not sens sufficient for the Holy Ghost 

to enlighten him. After his revelations were read 

condemned & commited to the flames he was cut off 

from the Church & given over to the buffetings of 

Satan untill the day of the Lord Jesus

March 20th Sunday. Sermon of Joseph the Seer



A large assembly of Saints gather together at 

an early hour to hear a discours deliverd upon the 

subject of Baptism by Joseph the Seer, but as a 

young child was dead & his corpes presented in the 

assembly it called forth many remarks from The 

speaker upon death & the resurrection which were 

in the highest degree interesting [ink color change] & his remarks 

upon Baptism was truly glorious to the believer 

in Jesus Christ. The following is a brief synopsis 

of some of the items presented in the discours



The Speaker read the 14 ch Revelations. And sayes 

"we have again the warning voice sounded in our midst 

which shows the uncertainty of human life. And 

in my leasure moments I have meditated upon the 

subject, & asked the question Why is it that infants 

innocent children are taken away from us, esspeci-

ally those that seem to be most intelligent beings" 

Answer "This world is a vary wicked world & 

it is a proverb that the world grow weaker & 

wiser, but if it is the case the world grows more wicke[d] 

& corrupt. In the early ages of the world a rich-

eous man & a man of God & intelligence had a better 

chance to do good to be received & believed that [than] at 

the present day, but in these days such a man is 

much opposed & persecuted by most of the inh-

abitants of the earth & he has much sorrow to pass 

through, hence the Lord takes many away even in 

infancy that they may escape the envy of man, 

the sorrows & evils of this present world & they were 

two pure & to lovly to live on Earth. Therefore if 

rightly considered we have, instead of mo[u]rning we 

have reason to rejoice, as they are deliverd from evil 

& we shall soon have them again. What chance 

is their for infidelity when we are parting with 

our friends almost daily none at all. The 

infidel will grasp at evry straw for help untill 

death stares him in the face & then his infidelity END_ENTRY takes its flight for the realities of the eternal 

world are resting upon him in mighty power &

when evry earthly support & prop fails him, he 

then sensibly feels the eternal truths of the imm-

ortality of the Soul. *Also the doctrin of Baptizi-

ng children or sprinkling them or they must 

welter in Hell is a doctrin not true not supported 

in Holy writ & is not consistant with the character 

of God. The moment that children leave this world 

they are taken to the bosom of Abraham. The 

ownly difference between the old & young dying 

is one lives longer in heaven & Eternal light 

& glory than the other & was freed a little sooner 

from this miserable wicked world. Notwithstanding 

all this glory we for a moment loose sight of it &

mourn the loss but we do not mourn as those 

without hope. [ink color change] * (We should take warning & not wait 

for the death bed to repent) As we se[e] the infant 

taken away by death, so may the youth & middle aged 

as well as the infant suddenly be called into 

eternity. Let this then proove as a warning to all 

not to procrastinate repentance or wait till a death 

bed, for it is the will of God that man should repent 

& serve him in health & in the strength & power 

of his mind in order to secure his blessings & not wait 

untill he is called to die.



"My intention (says the speaker) 

was to have treated upon the subject of Baptism, 

But having a case of death before us, I thought it 

proper to refer to that subject. I will now however 

say a few words upon that subject ^Baptism^ as intended

God has made certain decreas which are fixed & unalt-

erable, for instance God set the sun, the moon, 

the stars in the heavens, & gi[v]en them their laws 

conditions, & bounds which they cannot pass except 

by his command, they all move in perfect harmony 

in there sphere & order & are as wonders, lights & 

signs unto us. The sea also has its bounds which 

it cannot pass God has set many signs in the earth 

as well as in heaven for instance the oaks of the forest 

the fruit of the tree, the herd of the field all bear a 

sign that seed hath been planted there. END_ENTRY bread & cheese & a pint of beer we made our 

a supper & went to bed, & I dreamed of falli

ng among thieves & robbers, who tryed to rob 

us under pretence that we had done sumthing 

wrong in London some years since I told them 

we never had been in London untill within a few 

months that we were Americans & had a family 

there, & we had come to preach the gospel &

we would preach to them if they would open 

their doors & after bothering awhile with 

them I awoke, & found it to be the first 

Christmas Eve I ever spent in London

The first Day of 1840 found me in company

Elder Kimball in No 40 Ironmonger Row Saint 

Lukes London, the great Metropolis of Britian 

& the world. This has been an important year 

to myself, to all the saints & to the world at 

Large in many respects. Never have I spent a 

year with more Interest than 1840 never have 

I been called to make greater Blessings Sacrifices 

or enjoyed greater Blessings. I have been called to 

make a sacrafize of the society of my wife & children 

not once beholding their faces, one of which is taken 

from time, (Sarah Emma is gone to be seen no more in this 

life) The whole year has been spent in a foreign nation 

combating error with everlasting truth, meeting with 

many contradictions of sinners who oppose themse

lves against the the Truth, Being stoned mobed 

& opposed, Yet the Lord hath blessed me with a 

great harvest of souls as seals of my ministry, many 

hundreds have received the word with joy & gladness 

& are now rejoicing in the new & Everlasting Covenant 

which saints live in a lively hope of meeting in 

the celestial glory of our God. I feel vary thank

ful to my heavenly father, for his great goodness 

& Loving kindness towards me & my Brethren During 

the Past year & may the Lord still be with us d

uring the following year, in fine evry year will be 

more & more interesting from this time forth un-

knoweth & time will determin. But may the Lord 

enable me with all the Twelve to return safe to 

our own native country & to the bosom of our 

wives & children, which may God grant for Chris-

t sake I pray. In looking over my Journal I find

THE YEAR 1840

It has gone, taken its departure to return 

no more forever. It has bourn its report to 

heaven, wheth[er] it be good or bad, its secnes 

will not again return upon the stage of action 

to be presented to the eye of man. To the 

reflecting mind it is evident, that no period of

the nineteenth centaury hath presented greater 

& more important events to the world, & lade a 

foundation for still greater things to follow in 

quick succession than 1840. It is also equ

ally true in various ages of the world that 

those subjects & things which have been in 

reality of the greatest importance to the whole 

world even Subjects upon which the vary tempo-

ral existance & prosperity of the Nations of the 

Earth hung, have been the most out of sight, the 

last to attract the Publick mind, & when discov-

erd, considerd of the least consequence, scorned 

& ridiculed to the last by a thoughtless multitude 

who like the ox going to the slaughter know not END_ENTRY the day of their visitation. This was evident

ly the case in the Days of Noah, of Lot--, of Cyrus 

of the Days of Jesus Christ before the 

overthrow of Jerrusalem & the dispersion 

of the Jews, among all the gentile nations 

whare they have remained Deprived of the 

privileges of the land of their fathers untill 

the present day. We are informed it will 

be in like manner at the Coming of the 

Son of Man. What are the signs of the 

times in this present generation even in 

1840, As it was in the days of Lot & Noah 

So it may be now, then the majority of 

the world, did not dissern those things that 

were of the most interest, but they felt the 

most interested in those things that soon-

est perished. In like manner the present 

generation as a mass among all the gentile 

nations do not seem to dissern or take 

any interest in any of the signs of the 

times of 1840 except those leading 

direct, to the Money & stock Exchanges

here the zeal, struggle & Interest of 

the world seems to centre to Devise END_ENTRY some means whareby they can devise some

means secure unto themselves, dollars &

cents, Pounds shillings & pence, & eartly 

dominion & power, but in the midst of this 

mighty struggle, there is a small portion of 

the community among the nations of the 

earth, who are looking upon other singns of 

this present generation as indicating a day 

big with events, even the restoration of pri-

mitive Christianity, the proclamation of the ful-

ness of the Everlasting gospel among all natio-

ns both Gentile & Jew, the restoration of the 

Jews to their own land, the rebuilding of 

Jerrusalem, great changes, Judgments, wars 

& revolutions of the gentile nations, the 

Second Advent of the Mesiah in the clouds 

of heaven, & the great Millennium or rest 

of the Saints of one thousand years all 

of which events have been predicted by 

the Holy Prophets who have Spoken since 

the world began. None feel more interested 

in the signs of the Heavens & the earth which 

clearly indicate these great & important END_ENTRY events than the Latter Day Saints.

Let us for a moment take a survey of 1840 

which has been a year of interest among all 

Nations. This is the tenth year of the church 

of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. the church 

has never been as prosperous as through 1840 

though she has just passed through a seene 

of unparelled persecution by the whole 

state of Missouri, who has driven, robed 

& murdered many of ther saints, & entirly 

expeled from the state about 12,000 of 

the Church, but as the persecution at Antioch 

proved to spread the work abroad evrywhare 

so it has been in this case, it has spread as 

it were with tenfold rapidity not ownly 

th[r]oughout America, but in England Scotland 

Wales, & Ireland, some of the Lamanite or 

American Indians have began to embrace the 

fulness of the gospel which is an important 

event in the History of the rise & progress 

of the church. While many of the Elders 

have been lifting up their voices in the 

most noted villages & cities of America 

The Twelve have been planting the work & END_ENTRY esstablishing churches in some of the most 

notable cities of Europe. During the year 

1840 churches have been esstablished in 

Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Worcester,

Hereford, London, Glasgow, Paisley Edingborgh 

& many other parts of England Scotland Wales &

Ireland. Elders have also gone to South 

Australia, the East Indies, & Germany more

than 4,000 has been added to the church by

Baptism in Europe in 1840, & two of the

Twelve have Started on a mission from

Nauvoo to visit the Jews in the Holy land 

of Jerrusalem. This indicates at least that 

the Lord has set his hand to prune his vineya-

rd one more for the last time to prepare the 

way for his second advent, & that he will 

make a short work in the Eearth. & cause

light & truth to prevail in the midst of this 

seenery, the hand of God is evidently began to

be lade in a degree upon the nations in Judmen[t]

In the United States many have suffered

The City of Natchez was instantly destroyed 

by a whirlwind. Nearly the whole country 

from the mouth of the Ohio to New Orleans END_ENTRY for more than 1,000 miles was inundated 

by water which has prooved vary destruct-

ive to all that country, & many parts that the 

water could not reach Insects have help destroy

there has also been great losses sustained in oth[e]r 

parts of that land by storm, hail & fire, & in 

additions to many other events in America 

1840 has brought a change of Politicks through

out that nation which will of course make a 

revolution in Government Affairs in many respe[c]ts.

Wars & rumours of wars are among the signs 

of Europe. Though England feels at the present

time as though she was swaying the sceptre over

nearly all the earth, even for the first time 

waving the british flag in China, still she 

is not without her troubles, she is begining 

to share in that distress of nations & which per

plexity, which will be prominant among the signs 

of the last days, great poverty prevails among 

the working class in England & more esspecially

in Ireland, much crying for bread is heard in

the streets. Erance has had great troubles from 

sources she least expected, for while she had END_ENTRY been to great expens in fiting out an army of

500,000 men to assist Mehemit Ali & for other 

purposes. Endeavering at the same time to fort

ify Paris by surrounding it with a strong

wall, but in the midst of this scenery they have

been suffering under one constant torrent 

of Judgment, the sea has hove itself beyound

its bounds the rivers Seine, Saone & Rhone 

overflowed their banks turned out of therr course

& these created a flood unparellelled in that land 

which washed away both corn & wine into the 

french Lake, cities Inundated, villages destroyed

Cattle drowned, towns burnt farmers ruined 

which created great trouble at home without 

war. The French Chambers appropriated 5,000,000 

of Frances [Francs] to relieve the present wants of the suffers 

of those inundations. But among the signs 

of 1840, none are more prominant than those

of the eastern world, even in the Holy Land

Mehemit Ali has made much noise in the world

by invading Syria & trying to take power 

unto himself, & as the Tirkish power was 

not sufficient to check him in his progress

England with other European Powers have END_ENTRY interfered, & caused Mehemet Ali to lie passive 

at their feet, but the effect of all these 

movements have been to prepare the way for

the return of the Jews to the land of there 

Fathers, & while the Lord is begining to give 

the Jews favor in the eyes of Kings that they 

m[a]y become their nursing fathers & Queens th[e]ir 

nursing mothers, they begin to see it time for 

them to make a right use of so favorable an 

opportunity & immediately return & rebuild

Jerrusalem, & the call is now is now going

forth among the Jews in all nations to ret-

urn & esspecially among the German continen

tal Jews. A call of this Kind is published in 

the (Der orient) a German Newspaper & among

many other things says "In no country of 

the earth are our brethren so numerous as in 

Syria, in none do they live in as dens masses 

so independant of the surrounding inhabitants

in none do they persevere so steadfastly in thei[r] 

faith in the promise of the Fathers as on the bea-

utiful shores of the Orontes. In Damascus 

alone live near 60,000. [FIGURE] The power of 

our enemies is gone, the angel of discord has END_ENTRY long since hown down their mighty hosts, & yet 

ye do not bestir yourselves people of Jehovah

what hinders, nothing but your own supineness.

"People of Jehovah raise yourselves from 

your thousand years slumber! Rally round 

leaders; have really the will. a moses will not be 

wanting. The rights of nations will never grow

old, take possession of the land of your fath

ers, build a third time the Temple on Zion 

greater & more magnificent than ever. Trust 

in the Lord who has led you safely through 

the vale of misery thousands of years. He 

also will not forsake you in your last con

flict."



These things are clearly in 

fulfillment of the predictions of the Prophets

from Moses to Christ, & clearly shows the 

present day is big with events. Jews &

Christians have now an equal privilege in 

Jerrusalem & among other privileges are 

permitted to gather their own taxes which 

has not before been allowed them. The 

eastern world has also sufferd by Earth

quake & Storm. Several late Earthquakes

in the Ionian Islands many lives have perished END_ENTRY On the 1st of Dec a dreadful storm raged on 

the black sea which caused great destruction 

of shiping & life, 18 Greek vessels 3 English 

& a much greater number, of Austrian 

Sardinians, & Napolitans, were utterly lost

even in the channel 7 were cast away.

Thus the Lord is beginning to vex all nations

with whirlwind, flood, war Earthquakes,

Fire, & many Judgments, ass well as signs

in the Heavens & Earth of the coming of 

the Son of Man still the Nations will not

learn wisdom neither practice righteousness 

by the things which they suffer neither 

do they dissern the signs of the times even 

of 1840. What 1841 will bring to pass 

time must determine. Their will be an 

increas of signs in the Heavens & earth, & 

still greater losses by storm tempest &

Earthquakes, on the land & sea & by fire. 

Trouble will be seen in the United States Gover-

ernment wars & rumours of wars will increas

among all nations, the return of the Jews 

will be hastened. The Distress of nations with

Perplexity will be felt more than ever throughout END_ENTRY W Woodruff's Journal 1833-1837.

When in the course of human

events has there ever been a more

important period than at the present

day and age of the world. It is at

once beneficial and instructive

to the reflecting mind to review

the past with candour and rightly

consider the present and be in

perfect readiness for that which is to

come. Whare is the Son or dau

ghter of Adam who hath a standing

in this day and generation that is

walking in the light and truth

as it is in Jesus Christ that can

survey this gentile nation with ins

ensibility or realize their situation

without feelings of the deepest emotion.

Who of us that hath been upheld and

supported from our infantile momen[ts]

to manhood and carried through many

dangers seen and unseen both temp

which God hath made in these last days

through evil as well as good report

and surrender himself a living sac

which is his reasonable service.





Believeing it to be benificial to review our

past life And not ownly our privilege

but duty to keep an accurate account

of our procedings. And it is to this

intent that I shall endeavour henceforth

to keep a journal of my travels that

when required I may give an accou

nt of my stewardship



 END_ENTRY March 1st 1801

My parents both father and mother

were born and bred in the town

of Farmington Connecticut.

My father Aphek Woodruff was

the Son of Eldad Woodruff. My

mother Bulah Thompson was the

daughter of Lot Thompson all of the

town of Farmington C.t.





I was born in the north

part of the town of Farmington

which is now called Avon





March 1st 1807. From the age of

14 to 23 my mind was often exer

cised upon the subject of my souls

salvation yet without submision

to God or being led by his spirit

untill the age of 23. Then at that age

I resolved by the grace of God assisting me

to be led by the spirit and word of God

into that truth which maketh free the

reby. I had no desire to join any of

the sectarian Churches for I found

by compareing the Churches with the

records of divine truth that they 



 END_ENTRY December 29th 1833

were neither contending nor receievi

ng the faith once delivered to the Sain

ts I could not discover the Church

or body of Christ visible among

men. I believed the Church of Christ

was in the wilderness and that there had

been a falling away from the pure

and undefiled religion before God

And I was a looking for the Church

to arise and again to be esstablished

upon the foundation of the ancient

Apostles and Prophets Christ Jesus the

Chief Corner Stone. After remai

ning in this state of mind for near

ly the term of four years I herd a

report circulated on the 29th day of

Dec 1833. that there was to be a

meeting held in the neighbourhood

by a Mormon priest. This meeting

was to be held in the Town of Richland

Oswego County New York. I had

moved two years previous to this from

Connecticut to this place with my

older Brother Azmon Woodruff



 END_ENTRY December 1833

We had purchased a farm together

and been living on it nearly

two years. We both were anxious

to attend the meeting. Accordingly we

we went and found a full cong

regation of people. The person that

was to preach was Zerah Pulsipher

an elder in the Church of Christ or

of the latter day saints. He commence[d]

the meeting with some introductory rem

arks and then prayed I felt the spirit of

God to bear witness that he was the servant

of God. He then commenced preaching

and that to us with authority, and when

he had finished his discourse I truly felt

that it was the first gospel sermon

that I had ever herd I thought it was

what I had long been looking for I

could not feel it my duty to leave the

house without bearing witness to the truth

before the people. I opened my eyes to see

my ears to hear my heart to understand

& my doors to entertain him who had

administered unto us. Brother Pulsipher





 END_ENTRY December 31st 1833

Continued labouring with us for several

days and on the 31st of Dec I with

my Brother Azmon Woodruff with

two yong females which had been hea

led by the laying on of hands went forw

ard in baptism. the day following there

was several others followed our example

among the rest was Noah Hatton

a preacher in the freewill Baptist

Church and several of the members

of his Church followed him in the ordi

nance of baptism. And on the 2nd of

Jan.ry. 1834 Brother Pulsipher es^s^tablish

ed a branch of the Church of Christ in

Richland Oswego Co. N.Y. containing

twelve members. He ordained Brother

Azmon Woodruff & Brother Noah

Hatton Elders and myself a teacher in

the Church of Christ. I truly felt that

I could exclaim with the servant of

God that it was better to be a door

keeper in the house of God than to

dwell in the tents of wickedness I felt

much of the spirit of God bearing witness

myself and go up to Zion. And

accordingly I used evry exertion

For Self defence and according to

Brother Joseph's request I delivered him

my Sword for his own use, our

witnessed many interesting things while on

this journey we made it a practice of pitching

our tents on Saturday night and not rem

had preaching on the Lords day. Brother

Joseph often addressed us in the nam[e]

often while addressing the camp he was

clothed upon with much of the spirit of

God his precepts were verry instructive

 END_ENTRY An Account of a Dream of the late 

Dr Phillip Doddridge





After some conversation with Dr Clark of 

St Alb[an]s who had been conversing in the 

evening upon the nature of the seperate orgeal

state & the probability that the scenes on which 

the soul would enter on its first leaving the body 

would have some resemblance to those with which 

it had been conversent while on earth that it might 

by Degrees be prepared for the more sublime happiness 

of the Heavenly Kingdom, this & other conversation 

of the same kind probably occasioned the following

Dream





The Doctor immagined

himself dangerously Ill at a friends House in London 

& after lying in this state some hours he thought 

his soul left the body & took its flight in some 

kind of live Vehicle which though vary different 

from the gross body it had just left was still 

ordered to persue his course through the air 

expecting some celestial Messenger to direct him 

till he was at some distance from the city, when 

turning back & viewing the town could not 

forbear saying to himself, how vain & trifling 

are those affairs in which the Inhabitants of those 

places are so eagerly employed appeared to me a 

seperate spirit = at length as he was still continuing 

his progress & tho without any certain 

directions yet easy & happy in his thoughts of 

the universal providence & government of God 

which extends alike to all [blank] worlds he 

was met by one who told him he was sent to con-

duct him to the place appointed for his abode from 

whom he considerd could be no other than an Angel 

but as I remember he appeared in the form of an 

Man they went on conversing together till they 

came within sight of a large spacious building 

which had the air of a palace upon his inquiring 

what it was his guide told him it was the place 

assigned for his residence at present, upon 

which the Dr [blank] That he remembered he read 

while on Earth that the eye had not seen nor the 

ear heard nor the heart conceived what God had laid 

up for his servants whareas he could easily have 

formed an idea of such a building from others he 

had seen though he acknowledged they were



 END_ENTRY greatly inferior to this in Eligance, the reason 

the guide gave him was plainly suggested by the 

conversation of the contrast that the scenes

first presented to him were contrived on purpose 

to bear a near resemblance to those he had been 

accustomed to on earth that he might be more 

easily & gradually prepared for the glories which 

would open upon him hereafter and which would 

at first view quite dazzle & overpower him

by this time they were come up to the palace & 

the guide [taketh] him led him through a kind of 

saloon into an inner parlour whare was a cup 

on which was empressed the figures of a vine 

& cluster of grapes, he asked the guide the 

meaning of it. He told him it was the cup in 

which His Saviour drank new wine in his kingdom 

with his disciples & that the figures carved upon 

it was intended to signify the union between Christ 

& his people implying that the grapes derived 

all their beauty & flavour from the vine so 

the Saints even in a State of Glory were 

indebted for their esstablishment in holyness & 

happyness to the union with their head in 

whom they are all complete. While they 

were thus conversing he herd a tap at the 

door & was informed by the Angel that it 

was the signal of the Lords Approach & was intend-

ed to prepare him for the interview accordingly 

in a vary short time he thought our Saviour

entered the room & upon his casting himself 

at his feet he graciously raised him up and with 

a smile of inexpressible complacency assured 

him of his faithful services finding acceptance 

and as a token of his peculiar regard & the 

intimate friendships with which he intended to 

honour him, he took the cup & after drinking 

of it himself gave it into his hands, the Dr 

would have declined at first as two great a 

favor but our Lord ^replied^ (as he did to Peter when he 

refused to let him wash his feet) if you drink not 

with me you have no part with me, this saying 

he observed filled him with such transport of 

gratitude love and admiration that he was about 

to sink under it. his Master seemed sensible 

of it & told him that he must leave him for 

the present but it would not be long before END_ENTRY he would repeat his visit & that in the mean 

time he would find enough to employ his thoughts

in reflecting on what had passed and contem-

plating the objects around him as soon as our 

Lord withdrew & his mind was more composed 

he observed the room was hung around with 

pictures & examineing more attentively he 

discoverd to his great surprised that they contained 

the history of his own life the most remarkable 

seenes he had passed through these represented in 

a most lively manner it may esily be imagined 

how much this would effect his mind the 

many temptations & trials he had been exposed 

to & the signal instances of the divine goodness 

to him in different parts of his life which were 

by this means all represented at once to his view 

excited the strongest emotions of gratitude 

esspecially when he reflected that he was 

out of the reach of any further danger & that

the purposes of divine love & mercy towards him 

were at length so happily accomplished, the 

exstacy of joy and thankfulness in to which these 

reflections threw him were so great that he 

awoke but for some considerable time after 

he arose the impression continued so lively 

that tears of Joy flowed down his cheeks and 

he said he never on any occasion rem[em]bered 

to have felt sentiments of Divine love and 

gratitude equally STRIKING

INCREASE OF CRIME





Mr Editor: I am horror stricken with

dreadful facts of almost daily occurrence.

Scarcely a news paper which is not surcharg-

ed with terrible acounts of murder, theft, 

robberies, houseburning or the like. Moral 

restraints no longer holds men in check. 

The ligaments of law are but feble barriers 

to licentious man. Ambition, rage revenge, or 

lust are the laws by which he is governed. 

The most slight insult is a pretext for 

shedding a fellow creature's blood, as if the 

blood of a murdered man had no voice 

before the throne of the Lord God o[f] heav-

en & earth. Dirks, Pistols, Bowie-knives, 

&c are daily worn by thousands—worn even 

at the plough. 

I tremble for the fate

of my Country—for the fate of the human 

family! whare will these things end? what a 

horrid state of things at this time compared 

with the moral situation of the world thirty 

years ago! what a recklessness of life! How 

Impotent are the laws of God and man in check-

ing the mighty tide of crime! What is 

to be the state of society; thirty years



 END_ENTRY [page torn] vice should go unchecked at a

[page torn]th the last ten years?– O, heaven! my 

[page torn] sickens! No human being on the earth will 

[page torn]e the fact tested. Long before thirty years 

the world will be smitten by the strong arm 

of Omnipotence! The most imposing events 

are hanging over the world—at the vary doors

— events which will put all past events in the 

shade— obliterating all the epochs of the 

human family— stamping a new era on the 

annals of time! These things are true, and 

are come on the world the pulpit is crying 

our peace & safety! these things are true 

and are come on the world as a snare:

aye as a snare or the scripures are not true. 

Why as a snare? because the pulpit is crying 

"peace & safety"! O what a crash of governments

thrones & empires is awaiting the world, and the 

pulpit is chaunting lullabies to its slumbering 

care! war, pestilence and fire, standing in 

dread array against the human family, and 

the conservators of its moral weal, hailing 

the dawn of universal piece—hailing the 

a millenial dawn, when the harbengers of 

war and carnage are standing in bold relief

over a guilty world.





They are dreaming about times of refreshing

from the presence of the Lord; when we

are to have the vials of his wrath! They are 

clothing in Brilliant Drapery, the future trium-

phs of the gospel when the drama is about to 

close and present a theatre of blood. They 

are in imagination, smoothly gliding by the 

gradual flow of time into a heaven of repose 

without once turning an eye to an intervening 

vortex, which is to engulph, perhaps, more 

than half the human family! They are 

spreading a banquet of peace and proclaiming



 END_ENTRY the acceptable year of the Lord, when he is 

about to deluge the world in fire! This tremen-

dious event is passed over by the pulpit as 

a doomsday work of Almighty God, when it is 

to be pre millennial and probably consummated 

on the present generation.





A deluge of water once depopulated the world 

for crime; a similar scourge, by a different elem-

ent, has a similar mission to perform & for a like 

cause. The measure of human crime is coming 

to the full, and the arm of Omnipotence lifted 

to "shake terribly the earth" and the watch 

quarrelling about creeds, territory or gold. 

The present Christian dispensation is about to 

close like the Jewish—the heavens about to 

[be] rolled together like a scroll; the star in that 

heaven about to be thrown from their 

orbits, in wild consternation and the indications 

overlooked; prophetic allusions to the 

terrible wreck, mistaken, misapplied or applyed 

to the wreck of Nature; an event without 

foundation in holy writ. These things are 

true.— They are not the freaks of a heated 

imagination; but predicated upon a long 

candid, cool, unbiassed investigation of 

the living oracles; and on the premises we 

throw the gontlet to all the clergy, learned 

or unlearned on earth!





S. M. M'CORKLE a layman



 END_ENTRY to light, iniquity must be purged out, then the veil will 

be rent and the blessings of heaven will flow down 

they will roll down like the Mississippi River. This 

Society shall have power to command Queens in their 

midst, I now deliver it as a prophecy that before ten 

years shall roll round the Queens of the earth shall 

come & pay their respects to this Society, they shall 

come with their millions & shall contribute of their 

abundance for the relief of the poor - if you will 

be pure, nothing can hinder.



After this instruction you will be responsible 

for your own sins, it is an honor to save yourselves 

all are Responsible to save themselves.



Prest. Smith after reading from the above 

mentioned chapt. continued to give instruction respect

ing the order of God, as established in the church, 

saying every one should aspire only to magnify his 

own office &c.



He then commenced reading the 13th. chapt 

"Though I speak with the tongues of men &c"; & said 

dont be limited in your views with regard to your 

neighbors virtues, but be limited towards your 

own virtues, & not think your selves more righte-

ous than others, you must enlarge your souls to-

wards others, if you would do like Jesus, & carry your 

fellow creatures to Abrahams bosom.



He said he had manifested long suffering 

& we must do so too - Prest Smith then read 

"Though I have the gift of prophecy" &c, He then 

said though one should be come mighty, do great 

things, overturn mountains &c & should then turn 

to eat & drink with the drunken; all former 

deeds would not save him, but he would go 

to destruction!.



As you increase in innocence & virtue 

as you increase in goodness let your hearts 

expand, let them be enlarged towards others

you must be long suffering & bear with the 

faults & errors of mankind How precious 

are the souls of men! The female part of 

community are apt to be contracted in their 

views. You must not be contracted, END_ENTRY but you must be liberal in your feelings.



Let this Society teach now to act towards 

husbands to treat them with mildness & affect-

ion. When men is borne down with trouble 

when he is perplexed, if he can meet a smile, 

an argument, if he can meet with mildness 

it will calm down his soul & soothe his feel-

ings, when the mind is going to despair 

it needs a solace.



This society is to get instruction thro' 

the order which God has established, thro' the 

medium of those appointed to lead & I now 

turn the Key to you in the name of God & this 

society shall rejoice & knowledge & intelligence 

shall flow down from this time, this is 

the beginning of better days to this Society.



When you go home never give a cross 

word, but let kindness charity & love, crown 

your works hence forward. dont envy sinners, 

have mercy on them, God will destroy them

Let your labors be mostly confined to those 

around you in your own circle; as far as 

knowledge is concerned, it may extend to 

all the world, but your administrations 

should be confined to the circle of your 

immediate accquaintance, & more 

especially to the members of the Society.



Those ordained to lead the society, 

are authorised to appoint the different 

offices as the circumstances shall require.



If any have a matter to reveal, 

let it be in your own tongue, do not indul

ge too much in the gift of tongues, or the 

devil will take advantage of the innocent. 

You may speak in tongues for your own 

comfort but I lay this down for a 

rule that if any thing is taught by the 

gift of tongues, it is not to be received 

for doctrine.



Prest Smith then offered instruct

ion respecting the propriety of females END_ENTRY administering to the sick by the laying 

on of hands, said it was according to 

revelation &c, said he was never placed 

in similar circumstances & never had 

given the same instruction.



He closed his instructions by ex-

pressing his satisfaction in improving 

the opportunity.



The spirit of the Lord was pour'd 

out in a very powerful manner, never 

to be forgotten by those present on that 

interesting occasion.

Testimony of Mother Lucy Smith.



Mother Smith rose & said she was glad the

time had come that iniquity could be detected 

& reproach thrown off from the heads of the 

church. We come into the church to be saved 

that we may live in peace & sit down in the 

kingdom of heaven. If we listen to, & circulate 

every evil report, we shall idly spend the 

time which should be appropriated to the 

reading of the scriptures, the Book of Mor-

mon - we must remember the words of 

Alma pray much at morning, noon &

evening - feed the poor &c, She said she 

was old could not meet with the Society 

but few times more, & wished to leave her 

testimony that the book of mormon is 

the book of God - that Joseph Smith is 

a man of God, a prophet of the Lord 

set apart to lead the people. If we

December 9, 1840 ~ Wednesday





Dec 9th We had a long pleasant days walk this 

day Elders Young Kimball & myself started from 

No 40 Ironmonger Row St Lukes London in the 

morning & walked to St Pauls Church & not withs-

tanding I had been over most parts of it before 

yet on this occasion we went together through evry 

part. We first visited the body of the cathdral 

see Aug 24th I gave a description of this 

cathedral, but in some respects it was incorrect 

being wrongly informed upon the subject. I 

make A few extracts from A printed descrip-

tion of the church, which I purchased while 

passing through. [FIGURE] St. Peter's at Rome 

was 145 years in building under twelve  s 

successive architects. But this building 

was completed in forty years under the superin-

tendance of one architect, Sir Christopher Wren 

under the direction of one principal mason, Mr 

Strong &c. The whole expens of erect-

ing this edifice amounted £1,564,874 14 ^S^ 6 ^[P]^ 

in addition to which the stone and iron enclousrure 

(which was cast at Lamberhurst, Kent) which 

surrounds the building, cost £11,202 0 ^s^ 6 ^p^ 

total £1,576,076 15s about $5,880,380 ^5[,] 486,361^ 

This sum was raised by a small tax on coal 

imported into London.



In the South west transept 

is a noble staircase, by which the ascent is made to 

the top. The number of steps, from the floor to 

the whispering Gallery is 280; including those 

to the golden gallery, 534; & to the ball, the whole 

number is 616.



A communication from this staircase 

leads the visitor, first to the Library, whare many 

most rare & valuable works are preserved. END_ENTRY The flooring is remarkable, being most artfully 

inlaid, without nail or peg it contains 2376 Peaces, 

like the fraiming of a billard table. In this room is 

a [FIGURES] painting of Bishop Compton under whom this 

cathedral was built.



The next is a vary curious ceome-

trical staircase, being the first ever made in England 

it has ninety steps, all supported by the bottom step.

of the door, ^seems^ is as loud as thunder at a distance, 

the least whisper is herardd round the whole circumf-

erence: and a person speaking against the wall, 

appears to be Present to another on the other side of 

the gallery though the distance between them is not 

less than 140 feet

one from G. A. Smith & one from Deacon Borough 

containing £3 pounds in a post office order 

{a wounded spirit and grief we can bear}



 END_ENTRY Sister Album sent us ^[FIGURE]^ two loaves of bread and 

a lump of Butter. -[Elder Kimball & myself]- bought 

each of our wives A Muslin DeLain Dress I also boug-

ht one of the same kind for Sister Eunice Woodruff all 

three of the Dresses or the pattern was exactly alik we 

{paid} 5 {sterling apiece [half] the summer dress} Also bought a foot rool rule a 

pair of nut cracks & twesers of Mrs Algood. We walked to 

London Bridge & took the rail road, & rode to Deptford

from thence to Greenwich, which stands upon the banks of 

the Thames & is the place from which European & 

American Mariners take their longitude. We walked from 

Greenwich to Woolwich, London, England which also stands upon the banks 

of the Thames, & is the most important Military Post in England

it is an exeeding cold day. we spent the evening with 

Br Bates, all the Saints there was in Woolwich was present 

but one. there is but six in all but they are firm in 

faith. we spent the night at a publick house the whole 

Distance of the Day 13 miles





February 5, 1841 ~ Friday





5th A vary cold day we spent the forepart of the day 

by the fireside at Br Bates, I read a book most through 

entitled the life and Death of John Fletcher. We spent 

the afternoon in visiting the town of Woolwich, which 

was truly interesting to me. We first visited the 

Artillary & Marin Barracks, passed through & had a view 

of their Drill & parade ground which I should judge to 

be a mile squair it is the largest I ever saw. As cold as it 

was their was a number of companies on parade & were 

drilling new recruits, we saw many hundred cannon one 

that measured 16 feet in length 3 1/2 diameter at the brich 

& 2 at the mouth, we saw one horse company exercising. 

We saw two soldiers buried under arms, the coffins 

were let down into the grave side by side about an ounce of 

dirt sprinkled upon them the Priest read the funeral 

Prayers & Ceremony. A company of soldiers then fired three 

rounds over their grave & retired. We next visited the Dock 

& Prision yard, which is considerd one of the most interesting 

Dock yards in the world. On passing through the gate in-

to the yard we entered our names & residence on book, was 

then conducted by Mr John Finsbury Policeman to all parts 

& branches of business in the yard. The government had in 

their employ in this yard many hundreds of men besides 

700 Prisioners who are ingaged in building Vessels steem boats 

ships of war, making anchors, cables, chains, Boilers,



 END_ENTRY shot, Balls, cannon, &c, the fires or Bellows were all 

worked by steam. the operation of the engines were 

pointed out unto us among many other curiosities 

we saw the Idrolick Press or pump, by which power 

the strength of all the anchors & chain cables are tried

with this small press they readily can break 150 

tons wait, they will snap an anchor into like a pipes stem 

that will weigh 5 tons. it clearly shows the consentrated 

power of the invention of men, we saw specemins of vari-

ous timbers which had been buried in the ground to see 

which would stand the longest & it was found that English 

Oak stood longer than fir or limcumvita. we saw the 

boat in which Captain Ross & his comrads were saved & 

lived in it a season after they were wrecked.





we went on to the upper Deck of the new 120 Gun 

Ship Trafalgar it has been upon the stocks a number 

of years but is to be launched in May 1841, it is consid

erd as large as any ship upon the seas, her Keel 

is 223 feet in length, has three fighting Decks, there 

is a new hewn stone Dock made on purpose to contain 

her, we also saw the ship which contains all the prisioners 

by night. After having a view of these things we 

left the Prision yard & took some refreshment at 

Br Painters house & took Steem Boat for London

I should judge the pop[ulation] of woolwich to be 50,000, it is 

a pleasant place esspecially in Summer, it lies about 

10 miles below London Bridge on the Thames, as we passed 

up the River, we left shiping on both sides of us of

evry class & Description, both in the river & Docks from 

Woolwich to London Bridge, we probably passed 

not less than 1,500 vessels during that distance we 

walked from London Bridge to 40 Ironmonger Row 

Saint Lukes & spent the night at Home again 14 miles





We visited Harriet who had the small pox & found 

her comfortable. She had had the kind or kow pox before 

but it appears to be no preventative these days





February 6, 1841 ~ Saturday





6th [FIGURE] I got 3 letters from the postman one from Dr 

Levi Richards, to me one from Sister Young to Elder 

Young Dec 25th one to Elder Kimball, Sister Young 

said Br Joseph was going to write for the Twelve to hold 

a conference in England in the Spring ordain as many 

as they thought wisdom & send them to all parts they 

could, & then for the Twelve to return to Nauvoo



 END_ENTRY We Baptized one in the evening. I perused the London

Weekly Dispatch, which gave an account of the wreck 

of the Packer Ship Garrick of Sandy Hook. Elders 

Kimble & O Hide, crossed the Atlantic twice in her 

when they first came to Eng & returned, her tonage 

was 1010, was a new ship, the paper also spoak of

12th [FIGURE] I wrote a letter to Sister Eliza Bromley 

one to Elder T. Kington & one to G A Smith





Elders Heber C. Kimball & Lorenzo Snow wen[t] 

to Woolwich. I received a letter from Br S^m^ith to Br 

Snow. Their is great excitement at the present 

time not ownly in the House of Parliament but throug[h]-

out London in consequence of the Apprehension &



 END_ENTRY imprisionment of Mr M C. Cleod a British Officer 

in Lockport Jail by the Inhabitants of the state of 

New York who are trying him for Arson & Murder 

& are determined to execute him if found guilty

this accusation is for the Burning of the Caroline 

on lake Erie in 1837 during the troubles in Canida 

England considers it a national & not an individ-

ual affair & that Mr MCCleod acted in those 

transactions by order of the British Government & 

not upon his own responsibility, & under these consi-

derations Parliament is determined to demand his 

release & defend his life even at the expens of an 

immediat war with America; Parliament has 

sent a special message & orders to the British Ambas

sador at washington what course to persue in the 

case. what will be the end of this matter time must 

determin. One thing is certain, if America 

haszards a war with England, She will find it to be 

more than a Joke to meet so strong a foe & one tha[t] 

is armed to the teeth for war, should truth speak She 

would represent England liturally at the present time 

the strongest among the nations, & chief in power 

& the main spring of the Gentile world, & she will 

remain a little season as an instrument in the hands 

of God, of bringing to pass great events, in the resto-

ration of the Jews, & will be a scourge to the surro

unding nations America not excepted, not because 

she is more virtueous or wrighteous, than the nations 

that surround her for in the midst of all her prof

essed wrighteousness her sins have reached unto 

heaven & God hath remembered her iniquities 

& she will soon feel the chastning hand of the 

Almighty, & will fall in her turn & great will be 

the fall thereoff. therefore O, England thou chief 

of the nations of Babylon prepare for thy DOOM





But O!! America America!! whose land is choice 

above that of all the footstool of God, whose constit-

ution was framed by the Spirit of inspiration 

& whose Government was esstablished by the hand 

hand of Omnipotent power, In the midst of thy 

meekness, humility & virtue thou was oppressed in 

thy weekness & unjustly grieved by thy mother



 END_ENTRY country, then that God who holds the destinies 

of all nations, Deliverd thee from thine oppressers 

& set thy nest on high & exhalted thee in the 

eyes of the nations, & poured upon thee without 

measure the blessings of heaven & the bounty 

of the earth, which thou hast for a long time enjoy

ed with none to molest or make afraid. O!! 

America how is it with thee now!! How art thou 

fallen, fallen, In the eyes of thy God,, thy prot-

ector & deliverer who changes not, & who will 

still avenge the Blood of the Innocent,,, Answer 

the prayer of the widow, regard the cry of the 

orphan & take vengance on thee. Thy salt hast 

lost its saviour, thy light hath gone out, Thine 

Eagles crest is stained with innocent blood even 

that of Saints. Thou hast made widows & orpheans 

whose Prayers & cries are assending into the ears of 

the Lord of Sabaoth, who was once thy friend & 

deliverer, But will now spedily pour out wrath 

& indignation upon thee & teach thee their is still 

a God in Israel. Americans A Sound once delight

ful to my ear, dids[t] thou not plough the ocean & seek 

an Assylum in the western world, beyound the 

reach of the Iron hand of oppression & tyranny to enjoy 

an equal right in the worship of thy God, & the 

Blessings of A republick, since thou has freely obtained 

this Blessing, & drank abundantly of its sweet fount

ain which produced an inexhaustable fountain store for 

the[e] & all thy citizens, why then hast thou 

deprived a portion of thy countryman of those 

glorious Blessings in which thou has so long shared 

By Driving thousands of the Saints from place to 

place, county to county, & state to state, spoil

ing their goods, burning their houses, robing the 

fruits of their labours, & last of all spill their 

Blood, & Marter them for the Word of God & the 

testimony of Jesus Christ, by so Doing thou 

hast made hundreds of widows & orpheans whose 

cry is assending into the ears of the Lord to 

avenge the blood of their murdered Husbands & 

Fathers & when they the persecuted have petitioned 

to the rulers for redress of their rongs they have END_ENTRY turned a Deaf ear to their cries. O America it 

is because of these things that thou art weighed in 

the balance & found wanting. from this time forth 

perplexity shall rest upon the nation, confusion 

reign in thy government, wisdom righteousness & truth 

will depart from thy senators & rulers, Discord 

& folly shall shall sit in thy congress & senate, thy 

shame shall be known among the nations of the 

Earth thy pride shall be humbled in the dust & thy 

haughtiness laid low, the heads of thy rulers shall 

be cut off & lade in the Dust, it shall be a vexation to 

understand the report of the sorrow pain & wo that 

shall come upon thee by sword, fire, tempest, Earthqu

akes, & pestilence, from the hand of God even these 

things shall come upon thee untill thy government is 

broken up & thou art destroyed as a nation from 

under Heaven: for thou hast not kept the command-

ments of the Lord but hast Broken them, Betrayed 

the Constitution of the Land, Polluted thine inheritan

ts, robed the innocent, shed the Blood of Saints 

& made many widows & orphans. Therefore from this 

hour these things shall come upon thee & shall not 

scease untill the whole is accomplished & fulfilled upon 

thine HEAD [FIGURE]

is said that Oliver Cromwell was imprisioned for 

a season, it was vary Antique & partly in ruins ther

are vary many castles in Wales of this kind, which 

ware built to defend themself against the English 

But it is evident from the manner of their constru-

ction, situation, & location, that they were not 

calculated so much for Defence against canon Ball 

as stones & arrows. I Dined in this town, ownly 

half a crown 2/6 for Dinner & /6 six pence for 

the waiter at table & another sixpens for a waiter 

to the coach, whare I paid 4/ more to ride to 

Monmouth the Capitol of Monmouthshire 16 miles it

throughough Wales, much of this rout was by the 

windings of the River Y, the Coachman run his 

horses Down the mountains which would much have 

endangered our lives had not the roads been good, when 

I arived in Monmouth, Elder James Morgan was waiting 

my arival, had giving out an appointment for me to preach 

in town at 7 oclock. I preached at the house of Robert 

Davis, the house was crouded & many that could 

not get in, 4 offerd themselves for Baptism the first

6th I spent the Day at Sister Morgans reading the history 

of Rome which was truly interesting esspecially the history 

of the twin Brothers of Romulus & Remus sons of Rhea Sylvia, which she said was by Mars the God of war, they 

war[e] flung into the river to be Drowned, but they wer saved, 

suckled by a wolf, & brought up by Acca Laurentia.





After acting awhile the part of a shepherds they learned 

their real birth, both were eager to reign & had a battle 

Remus was killed, Romuleus being now sole comma-

city that was one Day to give laws to the world it was 

called Rome after the name of the founder & built upon 

the palestine Hill on which he had taken his success

was almost square containing about one thousand 

houses about a mile in compass. Hannibal after fighting 

nobly for his country untill he was old being persecuted 

from country to country & Deserted by his friends he took 

poison, & expired as he had lived with intriped bravery





Pompey's & Caesar career was noted in the history of Rome

Pompey was finally Defeated by Caesar. Deserted by his 

friend & murdered upon the sea shore in sight of his wife 

his head taken off & presented to Caesar. Philip & an

other Roman soldier who had served under Pompey in his 

youth paid their last honours to his remains which laid 

exposed upon the beach by burning his body & burying his 

ashes under a little rising earth over which they pla

ced the following inscription "He whose merits deserve 

a Temple can now scarcely find a tomb.["] & Caesar fared 

but little better for after serving his country faithfully

 END_ENTRY at the hand of their friends or soldiers & obtained 

it becaus they [were] Defeated in battle. It is observed that 

not one of those who had a hand in the Death of 

Caesar Died a natural Death but either killed themselves 

or were killed by others, in fine suicide was a 

common thing among the grecian & Roman Generals 

soldiers & poets, many Died by the use of hemlock 

& other poisons, as well as by the Dagger. Cleopatra 

sought Death by the sting of the Asp rather than to 

have Augustus take her to Rome. Antoeny killed 

himself with his sword, which left Augustus sole 

master of the Roman Empire. He Died a natural 

Death at 76 years of age after reigning 41 years & 

having the affections of the Roman people, His 

power began in slaughter & terminated in the good of the 

people, so that it was said of him "that it would have 

been good for mankind if he had not been born, or 

if he never had died. Tiberius next took the govern

ment of Rome many were executed During his 

reign But he was smotherd or poisond in the 78 

year of his age after reigning 22 years. It was 

in the eighteenth year of the reign of Tiberus 

that Christ was crucified, shortly after his Death 

Pilate wrote to Tiberus an account of his passions 

resurrection, & miricles, & requested that Christ might 

be accounted a God by the Romans. [FIGURES]

Caius Caligula reign was the most strange extravagant 

inconsistant, & cruel of any tyrant that ever 

reigned in Rome. He was killed with daggers by Cherea 

& others at one of his games at 29th year of his 

age after a short reign of three years ten months & 

eight Days. Claudius next reigned in mildness he restor-

ed Judea to Herod Agrippa which Caligula had taken from 

Herod Antipas his uncle the man who had put John 

the Baptist to death. [##Matthew 14:1-12##] Nero began his reign in AD 54, though 

but 17 years of age his reign was Dreadful tyranical 

cruel & wicked, even with the Romans but more 

esspecially with the Christians, among the many 

Christians that were marterd in Nero reign was the 

beheading of St Paul & crucifiing of St Peter 

he also put to Death Seneca the philosopher & Lucean 

the poet, & after gluting his ungodly passion 

with the Death of thousands, he eagerly sought 

Death many ways before the wrech could find it

7 months & 28 days. Galba next reigned 7 months & 

lost his head. Otho took his place & was killed in 

battle. Vespasian was declaired emperor in AD 70 & 

gave his son Titus command of the army that was 

to lay siege to Jerrusalem, while John & Simon were 

at war with each other in the city of Jerrusalem & 

the roman army without, & the vengeance of God 

from above the citiy was soon distroyed, the temple 

not excepted, the number who perished in the 

siege was above a million of souls & almost 100,000 

led away captive. Vespasion died a natural death 

standing upon his feet. Titus Died from a fever a 

little Distance from Rome. Domitian commenced 

reigning AD 81, which was cruel & unmerciful he

was put to Death by Stephanus & succeded by Nerva 

in AD 96, who Died of a fever after a reign of one year 

four months & nine Days, he was succeded by Trajan 

who has been noted for his perseverence in great under-

takings among which was the stupendeous work of build-

ing a bridge across the Danube, this amazing structure

consisting of twenty two arches a hundred & fifty 

feet high & a hundred & seventy broad, the ruins of 

this structure remain to this Day, & show modern 

architects how far they were surpassed by the Ancients 

both in the greatness & boldness of their Design. the chr-

istians suffered during his reign. Trajan died of 

the apoplexy in AD 117 after a reign of 19 years 6 months 

& 15 days. Trajan Column erected at Rome AD 114 

after the reign of several others Maximin comm-

enced his reign in AD 235 this gigantic man was no less 

than eight feet & a half high he had a body & strength

corresponding to his size, his strength was so great that 

he was able to draw a carriage which two oxen could 

not move. He could strike out a horse's teeth with a 

blow of his fist & break his its thigh with a kick. He 

generally ate 40 pounds weight of flesh each day &

drank six gallons of wine, his guards finally slew him 

with his son while they were asleep in their tent

Constantine the great commenced his reign in AD 308

shot through the heart with a rifle on the fourth fire at the distance of eighty yards. Congress is in uproar

upon Kirtland & also upon the whole land he sent me the counsel of the Presidency of our quorum which was to

teach the saints upon the Islands of the sea to immediately sell their property & prepare themselves to go

to the land of Zion which is a place of safety & deliverance that they may escape the just judgments of God

that are at the doors. I also perused the late papers of the day found that all things indicate that great trouble

of the word of God. I walked to Br Ames & spent the night was still quite unwell distance 4 miles





March 29, 1838 ~ Thursday





29 I arose quite weak my Bowel complaint continued spent the day at Br Ames was not able to attend

the meeting spent an ill night. The LORD is manifesting his work in great condeseension & mercy to the Blood

of Ephraim & honest in heart upon these Islands of the sea both by dreams & vissions, signs, healings &

wonders. One remarkable circumstance that happened on this day I will mention as follows Mr

Ebenezar Carver had been earnestly investigating the subject of the gospel as we set it forth & while desireing that

he might know the truth of it he walked to the sea shore desireing that he might have some sign and while the

word of God was for him to meditate upon that there should no sign be given but the sign of the Prophet Jonas

on a sudden their was a large fish arose on the water in the sea at a distance from him & suddenly sunk

out of sight he much desired to again see the sight immediately the fish again arose on the top of the water

accompanied with another fish of the same specie & size & one of them swam on a strait line on the top

of the water towards Mr Carver as he stood upon the beach when the fish came as near his feet as the water

would permit him the fish looked at the man with a penetrating eye as though he had a message for him he

then returned to his mate in the ocean & swam out of sight & Mr Carver returned meditating upon this



 END_ENTRY strange sight & sign & the wonderful condeseenscion of the Lord. It is worthy of remark that this was at a

season of the year when fish of that size is not known upon these shores or coast & they never at any season

of the year are known to come ashore as in this case. Mr Carver had dreams at night to confirm him that these

things was a sign to him. Great & marvelous are the works of the Lord

many miles, he had now made ship reck of faith was cut of[f] from the church & he with some others in like circum-

11th [FIGURE] This is a day to be remembered by me because of the great variety of events that transpired with

me, no day of my life was ever attended with more of a change of circumstances & places which my

eyes beheld & ears herd & heart felt than on this day. I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep & took breakfast



 END_ENTRY with father Alley, sister Alley was rather low in her mind but I endeavoured to comfortr her in the

gospel. We took a farewell of them & walked to Chelsea from thence to Charleston we here visited

the Bunkerhill Monument & walked upon the entrenchment that was flung up by our brave fathers during

the night before that memorable battle that was fought upon Bunker Hill but the roar of cannon & clash

of arms had long since ceased & the green turf was now trod in safety & the sound from the populous

city of Boston was now echoing through the air while our fathers sleep in peace. We had a view of

the navy yard as we passed along from thence we entered the city of Boston being the first day

my eyes ever beheld its welth or my foosteps ever trod its streets I spent several hours in visiting

this city which contained a pop of about 100,000 inhabitants & also as near beatiful & well furnished

market probably as any in America. We visited the statehouse which was splendid. I walked to the

Cupalo & had a fair view of the whole city. I walked around the commons which was enclosed

with an Iron railing of about 2 1/2 miles in length I visited the Tremont House the most noted public

house in the city, & also the shiping. We dined at Mr Thayre's in Belknap street upon a rich salmon

we visited several of the saints in the city during the day. We also visit south Boston & had a fair

view of the splendid Mount Washington House a place of entertainment for gentlemen who

wish to retire from the bustle & noise of the City. I next walked over the long bridge to Cambridge

from thence to Cambridge point I went to the goal in order to have an interview & to comfort Elder

Albert P. Rockwood who had been cast into prison by his enemies for debts in order to trouble and

distress him, when I arived at the prison the Jailor permitted me to enter into the room whare he

was & it was truly a happy meeting for althoug we were strangers after the flesh yet we were

united in the spirit. This was the first time I ever entered into a prison to see an Elder of Israel

but after the keeper of the prison doors had turned the key upon us & left us together to

comfort each other in the midst of Iron grates & bars I began to inquire into the state of his mind

and it gladdened my soul to find him strong in the GOD of Abram Daniel & Eligah he was rejoicing

in God contented in his mind & strong in the faith once deliverd to the saints Brother Rockwood had

the Bible, Book of Mormon, P. P. Pratts voice of warning, & the Evening & Morning star as his companions



 END_ENTRY which he constantly read. We conversed together about three hours in this solitary abode & our

souls were made glad. He informed me of many things that had transpired while he was there in

gaol & among the variety he made mention of the goal taking fire a few days previous to my visiting

him, he said this looked sumthing like a dark hour the fire was roaring over his head while a scene of

uproar confusion & distress was upon every hand engines were rapidly playing around the building—water

pouring into every room the people hallowing in the streets the prisoners crying for mercy to be streets let out

lest they be consumed in the fire one of the number was strugling in the agonies of death while others were

cursing & swearing &c Br Rockwood said he felt composed through the confused scenery untill the fire was extin-

guished & silence once more was known in the gaol. Elder Rockwood was writing his life while in this state of

confinement he sent a roll of the same by me to his wife in Holliston, at half past 8 oclock P.M. the Jailor

came & unlocked the prison doors & I took the parting hand with this worthy Brother while he manifested

much Joy for my visit. Well whose soul would not be cheered to have a friend visit them while cast into

prison. I left him in good spirits & bent my way back again to the city of Boston while crossing the

long bridge on my return I herd the cry of fire, the ringing of Bells, the ratling of the engines, I soon beheld

the flames begin to illuminate the city it was however extinguished in half an hour by the flood of water

that was poured in upon the fire from the engines. I then crossed into the city & being alone & a stranger

& in the darkness of the night I lost my way in the midst of the city, but after wandering a wile I called

into Myrtle street No 9 & I there found Elder Ball with a company of saints in a room occupied by Sister

Vose all were patiently waiting for me, it was a happy meeting. Notwithstanding it was late in the evening

I spent a season in teaching them the things of God I then left these sisters who are patient in tribulation & wal-

ked with Elder Ball into Butoph street No 12 whare Elder Ball resides with his Mother we here spent

13th Sunday after hearing of several distressing steamboat disasters which shows that the destroyer

is riding upon the waters I read an account this morning in the Boston daily news of a great destruction

in Europe by water the letter was dated Berlin the substance of the account was that the waters

had rolled beyound there bounds & overflown the order & in less than 15 minutes rising of 70

towns were wholey inundated & destroyed, surely the word of God is fullfilling the sea troudled

& waves roaring. I spent a short time in the morning in visiting the Roman Catholic Church they

were attending their morning meeting when I entered the house. After visiting the house & beholding

their Priest Images & mockery & see them use their Holy water I left the house disgusted with their

religion. I met with Elder Ball & the saints in the fore part of the day at Sister Vose's room

of citizens at the same place at 3 oclock PM. & I spoke unto them from Peter 1 ch 20, 21. the

saints appeared edefyed & the minds of some enquiring a certain physician by the name of Salmon

S Wilder manifested great firmness in the cause. After meeting I walked to Mr Thayre's in Belknap

street & took supper with sisters Vose & Holman. We again met the saints in the evening & had

an interesting time in speaking of the goodness of God & breaking bread unto the saints the spirit

of God rested upon us & our souls were edefyed & the sisters manifested their faith & strength

in the work of God in which they were enjaged & notwithstanding some had taken great advantage

of their liberality yet they had not lost confidence in God or his servants & their charity was

manifested towards us we took the parting hand with these saints of God & again spent the night with

reading P. P. Pratt's Pamphlet in answer to Mr LaRoy Sunderland pieces in the Zions Watchman against the Book

of Mormon & Parley's voice of warning I never was more edefied in reading a pamphlet than on this occasion he

evening to market & it was a peculiar scene to me. It put me in mind of the merchandize

of Babylon that the Revelator John spoke of. The market was one universal mass of human

er of Spring & Renwick street. this was also an interesting Brother my heart burned within me 

while walking arm in arm through the city at hearing a relation from him of the leading of his 

mind by the spirit of God. & I felt to rejoice that the city of New York was producing such saints 

this Brother was of the literal desendant of the tride Ephraim they had always had the name of Ephraim in the 

family of all their progenitors & down to the present day. Brother Everett about a year since had an 

interview with forty Lamanite chiefs in this city while on their return from Washington to their 

homes. When he first entered the room whare they were sitting they grasped his hand in friendship as 

though they were inspired to know who he was. Brother Everett gave them an account of the Book 

of Mormon & informed them that the fulness of the gospel would soon go to them they apparently 

receieved the intelligence with the greatest degree of interest. he told them to receive it & teach their 

tribes to do so when it come unto them; the chiefs promised to do so & wished him to come among 

them & teach them these things. we arived at the place of meeting which closed this interesting su-

bject. Elder O. Pratt preached a highly edefying discours to us from the 102 Psalm the Lord

a walk in company with Elder Ball into the State of [FIGURE] NEW JERSEY It was a pleasant walk indeed. we 

passed the schoolhouse whare sat the youth with his mind occupied in study that he might be prepared to take the 

place of his parents in the rising generation. This view brought fresh to my memory the days of my youth & 

vanity. We next passed the farmhouse crowned with the fruits of a dairy which was so large that it required 

a hors mill to churn the butter. the hors was upon the tread wheel for that purpose as we passed along. 

smaller wheels are often in use whare the dairies are not so large & they are often turned by a sheep, a dog, or 

a boy; others are larger still & carried by water. After walking a distance in the state above named we took 

a by path & rose a high hill the road was strewed with a great variety of flowers the honey suckle &c. we soon came 

to the top of the hill whare we had a beautiful view of the surrounding country we sat down under the shade of a 

chesnut & took a survey of the distant fields of grain which presented a pleasing prospect. & while the birds tuned 

their melodious notes we bowed our knees in prayer to the Author of every blessing. What reflections occupy the 

mind of man amid the speed of time. This is the first time my feet ever pressed the soil of New jersey. this adds 

another state to the list that I have visited in my Peregrinations [FIGURE] Seventeen States O time how swift thou art

Steroetyped in that place & was going to bring 

the plates to England to Print the work here

12th [FIGURE] In company with Sisters Woodruff 

Clark & Haywood I visited Lord 

Nelsons monument of Liverpool. 

Opened on the 21 day of Oct 1813

The subscription commenced for this purpose 

on the 15 Nov 1805 and finished the same year 

amounting to about £9000. The first stone was 

laid on the 15 July 1812. The whole of the 

design was Planned by Mathew Charles Wyatt 

Esqr ^R. A^ of London. The monument which is 

in Bronze was executed by Richard Westmacott 

Esqr. R. A. London; the Pedestal of hendal Marble 

by Messrs Hetherington & Webster of this town.





Description of the Monument 

The figures which constitute the principal design are 

Nelson, victory, Death, his country mourning 

for her loss, and her navy eager to avenge it, 

naturally claim a place in the Group. The principal 

figure is the Admiral, who resting one foot on 

a conquered enemy and the other on a cannon 

with an eye stedfast and upraised to victory 

is recieving from her a fourth Naval crown upon 

his sword which to indicate the loss of his



 END_ENTRY right arm, is held in his left hand. The loss of 

his right arm is concealed by the Flag which 

the Genius of victory is lowering to him & under 

the folds of which Death lies in ambush for 

his victim by which it is indicated that he 

recieved the reward of victory and the stroke of 

Death at the same time. By the figure of an enraged 

british seaman is represented the zeal of the 

navy to revenge the loss of its most gallant leader

Brittanna in the back ground with laurels in her 

hand and leaning regardless of them on her 

spear and shield describing the feelings of 

the country fluctuating between the pride 

and anguish of a triumph so dearly purchased.



 

Description of the Pedestial 

Round the uper part of the moulding are inscribed 

Lord Nelson's ever memorable & to be revered words 

"England expects evry man to do his duty" 

At the bose [base] of the Pedestal are four figures, in 

chains, as captives emblematic of the four peculiarly 

great victories he achieved. The space between 

these figures on the sides of the Pedestal are 

filled by four grand Bass reliefs, executed in 

Bronze representing the four glorious victories

April 2nd Attended worship in the Lords house upon

this sabbath day. I have spent the time for several

days past in perusing the outlines of ancient and

modern HISTORY on a new plan, By Rev Royal

Robbins. It strikes the reflecting mind with deep

sensibility to contemplate the scenery of the

rise, progress, decline & fall of the Nations and

kingdoms of the earth from the days of ADAM

untill 1837 years aft^er^ Christ. And it is equally inter

esting to contemplate the day that is now at

hand & hath already begun in fulfillment of

ancient prophecy in bringing the church of

Christ out of the wilderness in esstablishing

Israel upon those lands by a Theocratical

government in fulfillment of the conenants

God made with Abram Isaac & Jacob. As this

hath began in my day & I am called to act a part

in the work by being plaaced with the first seventy

Elders of Israel to become a special witness

of Jesus Crist to all nations I need much faith

fortitude, holiness, & wisdom. May the Lord

enable me not to seek honour from man but

God & be faithful in clearing my garments of

the blood of gentile & Jew and do honour to the 

HOLY Priesthood & the annointing that now awaiteth me



 END_ENTRY April 3, 1837 ~ Monday





April 3rd The day had now arived for preperations

for the solumn assembly the annointing & the endowment

of the Elders of Israel or at least for those that were

not endowed in Kirtland the strong hold of the daughter

of Zion in the spring of 1836 & as I was absent

at that time my day is now come & my time at hand

for those blessings & I shall record the events of

each day of the endowment for the benefit of the

generation to come. I upon this third day of April

met in the house of the Lord with a number of the

seventies to receiev counsel respecting our

washing & anointing. I was appointed with Elder

G. Meeks to visit President F. G. Williams &

have the perfumes & oil prepared against the day

following I consider'd it a privilege to wait upon

the Elders of Israel in this thing that we might

become the annointed of the Lord according

to the words of the Poet & the Revelations

of JESUS CHRIST





We'll wash and be washed and with oil be anointed

Withal not omit the washing of feet

For he that receiveth his PENNY appointed

Must surely be clean at the hearvest of wheat

After attending to the duties above spoken I repaired

to a room in company with Elder Meeks & Priest J Turpin

to attend to our first washing after washing our

bodies from head to foot in soap & watter we then

washed ourselves in clear watter next in perfumed

spirits the spirit of God was with us & we had a

spiritual time. We spent the evening with several

Elders in Prayer before God & the Power of God

rested upon us.

watter & perfumes that our bodies might be prepared

& Elder G. W. Meeks were the first washed under



 END_ENTRY the hands of President Joseph Young we then assisted

President Young in washing our Brethren the Elders

much of the spirit of God rested upon us I washed &

perfumed the bodies of a number of my Brethren

& the interview closed after after expressing our feelings to each

other. We again met together in the quorum of the sev

enties at the upper part of the Lords house at early

candle light to receieve our anointing. The quorums of

the Deacons, Teachers, & Priest occupied one apartment

the Elders another & the seventies the third. each

quorums met for the anointing. Three of the presidents

met with the seventies viz H Aldrich J. Young and

Z. Coultrin President Coultrin opened the meeting

by prayer & after conversing plainly to those who

were to be anointed they proceded to business the

presidency consecrated the oil before God that it

might be holy. The person to be anointed then took a

seat & the presidency then laid hands upon his head 

& consecrated him unto God & then anointed him in

the name of the Lord & pronounced such blessings

upon his his head as the testimony of Jesus shall direct

which is the spirit of prophecy.





We had a

glorious season indeed in this solumn ordinance of the

house of the Lord there were fifteen annointed in

our quorum mostly by President Coultrin the power

of God rested upon us.





President Coultrin

anointed me & the following are some of the blessing

that he pronounced upon my head while clothed upon

by the spirit & Power of God, viz. that God would

bless me with all the powers of the priesthood &

give me a multiplicity of blessing that kings would

tremble upon their thrones at my word, that I should

become a counsellor & multitudes should seek cou

nsel at my mouth & I should have great wisdom



 END_ENTRY & power to fly through the midst under heaven as Philip

travled by the spirit, that I should have power over

my enemies & have long life to bring many into the

kingdom of God [##Acts 8:39##] Also that I should have the riches

of the earth & that I should have sons & consecrate

them priests unto God in zion & that I should tread

upon the ashes of my enemies in Jackson County they

that had sought to take my life & the life of my breth

ren that went to redeem zion & he also sealed

upon my head all the blessing that had previously

been pronounced upon me & thes blessing were

sealed upon my head with a loud amen from all

of the anointed present in the name of Jesus Christ 

Much of the power & spirit of God & a sens of the

virtue of the ordinance rested upon me May God

enable me to possess those blessing & obtain those

vishions that have been promised me in this &

other solumn ordinances & keep me from dish-

onouring my anointing & the Holy Priesthood

for Christ Sake amen





The interview closed about

10 o' clock P.M. I then repaired into the lower court of

the Lords house in company with Elders Joseph B.

Nobles & G. W. Meeks to spend the night (after being

anointed) in prayer & fasting before God the vales

being closed we entered the Elders pulpit & there

upon our knees we ple^a^d with God & we covenanted

with each other in the holy stand that we would not

give sleep to our eyes neither take food untill we

receieved a blessing from God by the outpourings

of his spirit upon us if it was untill the end of three

days and according to our covenant we commenced

praying & a part of the night we had a severe

trial of our faith by great temptation from Satan

but before day we gained a good degree of victory

over the Devil & the Lord poured out his spirit

upon us & we felt it good to be in the house of



 END_ENTRY God while nature was hushed in silenced by the

sable shades of night. After spending the night

in prayer we returned to our homes in the morning

intending to spend the day in prayer & fasting for

still greater blessings this being upon

April 5th I spent a part of the day in attending the

high council the remainder in writing, prayer & 

fasting I again repaired to the upper ^lower^ part of the

house of the Lord at 5 oclock PM. with the quorum

of the seventies for a solumn assembly anointing

&c. Three out of the seven presidents were present

& anointed twelve the spirit of God sat upon us

& we were satisfied with our blessing conseque-

ntly I returned home with those brethren with

whom I had covenanted for a blessing & took some

food & retired to rest being 24 hours since we

had taken food or sleep. There was much of the

spirit of prophesy & revelation poured upon the

heads of the anointed in the diferent quorums





April 6, 1837 ~ Thursday





April. 6.th [FIGURE] 1837. This being more part-

icular the day of the solumn assembly, or a day that

is looked upon an^n^ually with feeling of greater interest

in celebration of the 6th of April 1830 as upon

that day the church of Latter day Saints was first

organized in this last dispensation & fulness of times

Henceforth the solumn assembly of the Elders

of Israel & all official members that can, will meet

in the LORDS house annually to attend to the most

solumn ordinances of the house of GOD & of receiev-

ing the visions & great things of heavens Therefore 

I shall be more particular in recording the transact

ions of this day than others for it is sumthing simil

ar to the Pentecost that St Paul speak of at Jerrusalem





I repaired to the house of the

Lord at 8 oclock A.M. & after spending an hour in the

lower part of the house the presidency of the church



 END_ENTRY called the quorums of the seventies into the upper part

of the house that they might be by themselves for awhile

as there was some business to be attended to in these

quorums before they could procede to the business of

the day below. In the first place six of the presidents

of the seventies were to leave the seventies & take

a station in the quorum of the travling high priest

hood and six other Presidents chosen in their stead

I shall not here give the particulars of this change

of councillers Suffice it to say that all of the

councillors first chosen excepting Joseph Young

were high priest befor the organization of the

seventies & they had a right to officiate in the

lower offices of the Church & there was some

difiference in the authority and office of the

quorums of high priesthood & seventies.





The six new Presidents chosen out of the seventies

to take the place of thos that were to leave

were John Gould, Josiah Butterfield, Salmon

Gee, [blank] Foster, John Gaylard.





After this matter was aranged theire

was a glorious ordinance performed upon the heads

of those who had been anointed (by the first

presidency of the Church Joseph Smith jr Sidney

Rigdon &c was this ordinance performed. it was

as follows. while all of the anointed present lifted

there hands towards heaven this first presidency

of the Church confirmed & sealed upon our

heads all the blessings of our ordination, anointing,

& Patriarchal with a seal in the presence of

God & the Lamb & holy angels that they should all

be fulfilled upon our heads that not one jot or tittle

should fail & the seal was confirmed upon our

heads with a shout of all the anointed with uplifted

hand to heaven HOSANNA. Hosanna. Hosanna. to

GOD & the LAMB. Amen. Amen. & Amen! Hosanna

Hosanna. Hosanna. to GOD & the LAMB. Amen—



 END_ENTRY Amen. & Amen. & Hosanna. Hosanna. Hosanna. to GOD

& the LAMB. Amen. Amen. & Amen. This was repeated

as it is written & if ever a shout entered the cabinet of

heaven that did & was repeated by angels on high

& caused the power of God to rest upon us.





(O, ye Priest of Baal. O, ye Gentile religionest O. ye inha

bitants of Babylon possessing the mark of the beast what

knowledge have ye of the ordinances or blessings or

virtues of the house & church of God) Great and

marvelous are the blessings and power of the ordinan-

ces of the Lord & his gospel made manifest on these occas-

ions. After being in the upper room about two hours

we again joined the congregation of the saints in the

lower court & the house came to order for the busi

ness of the day, the veils were closed & each apartment

commenced the duties of the day the washing of the

feet of the anointed was the first business that

was performed. The twelve assisted our presidency

in washing the feet Elder Heber Kimble one of the twelve

apostles attended to the washing of my feet & prophesied

upon my head & pronounced me clean from the Blood

of this generation this as it was with JESUS when

he washed his deciples feet. great were the blessings

that rested upon us in this ordinance. After the washing

of feet, the veils were rolled, which brought the con-

gregation into one assembly, the stand of the priesthood

were still coverd with the veils the Presidency stood

in the lower stand & President Joseph Smith jr arose

and addressed the congregation for the term of three

hours clothed with the power, spirit, & image of GOD

He unbosom'd his mind & feelings in the house of his

friends. He presented many things of vast importance to the

minds of the Elders of Israel. O that they might be written

upon our hearts as with an iron pen to remain forever

that we might practice them in our lives. That fountain

of light, principle & virtue that came forth out of



 END_ENTRY the heart & mouth of the prophet JOSEPH whose

soul like Enoch's swelld wide as eternity I say

such evidences presented in such a forcible manner

ought to drive into oblivion every particle of unbelief

& dubiety from the mind of the hearers, for such

language sentiment principle & spirit cannot

flow from darkness. Joseph Smith jr is a prophet

of God rised up for the deliverance of Israel as

true as my heart now burns within me while

I am penning thes lines which is as true as truth

itself. President Hiram Smith followed Joseph with

many useful remarks he also was clothed with much

of the Spirit of God. Joseph desired us to give heed to his

words & teaching this once & be wise that zion &

her Stakes might spedily be redeemed he instructed

us to be sure & thask those that enter the Kingdom

to send up their wise men to Kirtland with there money

to counsel with the presidency & purchase an interit

ance before they move their families or bring the

poor to the places of gathering for to suffer. Also

that we must keep in view the institution of the

Kirtland safety society & if the Elders of Israel

would be faithful & do what was in their power

this once Kirtland should spedily be redeemed &

become a strong hold not to be thrown down. Joseph

presented us in some degree the plot of the city

of Kirtland (which is the strong hold of the daughter

of zion) as it was given him by vision, it was

great marvelous & glorious. the city extended to the

east, west, north, & south, steam boats will

come puffing into the city our goods will be conve

yed upon railroads from Kirtland to many places

& probably to zion. houses of worship would be

reared unto the most high beautiful streets was

to be made for the saints to walk in Kings of the 

earth would come to behold the glory thereof



 END_ENTRY & many glorious things not now to be named would

be bestowed upon the saints, but all these things are

better imagined than spoken by the children of Jacob





President Oliver Cowder followed

Hiram Smith & made but few remarks but verry

appropriate, he called upon the Elders to keep within

the bounds of their knowledge & to let the great myster

ies of the Kingdom alone for the gentiles had not

a knowledge even of the first principles of the

gospel. that it was far better to preach what the

people would call the small things of the Bible

than to enter into the vishions of Isaiah, Ezekiel,

& John &c.





President Sidney Rigdon

next spoke & said many important things and

impress'd it upon the Elders of Israel with great

force & eloquence to lay to with their mights this

once for the redemption of Kirtland that Israel

may be safe & free and have a place to set his foot

{for if we do not give heed to the word we should suffer loss}





After the Presidency closed

their remarks the twelve were called upon to

break bread for the multitude (as Jesus did in the days

of the apostles) that they might all be filled they did so &

we were all filled & was made glad while feasting

with Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelest, Pasters,

Teachers, & Deacons.





After the feast was

closed thanks was returned to GOD with uplifted hands

to heaven this being about the seting of the son all

had the privilege of returning to thir homes that felt

disposed & the rest might spend the night in the house

of the Lord in prayer, & exoortation, praise & thanks

giving. At about candle light the meeting commenced

with great interest Joseph requested the congregation

to speak their feelings freely & pray according to the spirit



 END_ENTRY The saints began to open their mouths & they were filled with

language unto edification one a prayer another exortation

some a doctrin & a psalm others a toungue, some an

interpretation Prophecy was also poured out upon us

& all things was done decently & in order & the night

was spent gloriously by the saints much of the gifts

of the gospel rested upon us. One Brother clothed

with the gift of tongues laid his hands upon my head &

prophesied great blessing upon me another brother

possessing the interpretation uttered it unto me to

my joy & consolation with the many blessing pronounced

upon my head he rehersed the blessing that Jacob

pronounced upon the heads of Joseph & said that

I should possess the blessings of heaven & of earth

& be much blessed in my ministry &c. [##Genesis 48:3-4##]

much Prophecy was uttered upon the heads of

many of the saints in other languages & was interpeted

which was glorious, thus was this day & night spent 

gloriously & those scenes will long be remembered

Rejoice O earth & shout O heavens for the natural

fruit of the tame olive tree is again manifest in the

earth. the fig tree is puting forth leaves. The

Church of Christ is travling out of the wilderness

with her gifts & graces which edify the body of

Christ. The house of God is reared in beauty &

splender according to the pattern given by the

vishions of heaven & the revelations of Jesus Christ

O, ye gentiles come & receieve the gospel repent &

be baptized for the remishion of your sins & recieve

the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands & partake

of the blessing of God with Israel that you may be

hid under the shadow of ^the^ ALMIGHTY in the day

of GODs wrath & Indignation upon babylon which is

at hand. The meeting continued untill break of

day when we all dispersed to our homes with great

Joy & consolation. May the Lord bless the saints

& have mercy upon the poor the sick & the afflicted

& deliver Israel from the gentile yoke for Jesus sake Amen

about to rend in twain {and the throne of God to appear} it appeared as though the elements were contending with each

other. We were travling through deep snow drifts most of the time during this sceneery. This

is one of the signs in the heavens in the last days spoken of by the ancient as well as modern

Edwin P Merriam Clerk of Said Conference



 END_ENTRY concerning the case of Brother Brewster I was one that opposed his ordination & I was much surprised that both

the chairman & clerk did not do the same instead of urging it forward for Br Brewster maintained the same

principle & possessed the same spirit for which he was cut off from the church in Kirtland by the high

council & even in this case he came forward & demanded the High & Holy priesthood at our hands in the

in the name of Jesus Christ I did not consider this to be the way that Aaron took the ministry upon himself

consequently I opposed it & the spirit of God opposed it also & after a struggle truth prevailed

we next rode to Quincy 4 miles & here an interesting scene presented itself to my view I first called at a

house which was occupied by Father & Mother Smith the patriarch of the church & also Samuel & Carlos

& their families. I then went out into the street & the saints that I have formerly been acquainted with met

me on every hand such as [Percy], Clapp, Allexander & A. O. Smoot & their families from the south, & B. Young

John Tailer, J. P Green, R Cahoon, B Andrews A & S Milliken with most all of the other Kirtland saints & soon

saw so many of my old friends I hardly knew who to go home with first finally I concluded to go & spent the night

with Brother Hale & we had an interesting time together in talking about our travels together upon the Islands of the

sea & also Br Hale gave me an account of his sufferings & those of his family & all the saints in Missouri during 

the past winter for they have suffered much from the inhaditants of Missouri who have turned mob with Governour

Bogs at their head they came upon the saints from time to time in battle aray they shot the saints down

like wi[l]d beasts & butchered others in cool blood & nocked the brains out of some after they [had] taken them prisioners

the soldiers shot down the cattle cows & hogs of the saints for the purpose of destroying them. The Saints

at times stood in their own defence & some of their enemies fell befor them & in consequence of which the

Governour issued orders for the final extermination of the saints out of the state & sent a general after his own heart

to execute his orders forthwith & this is the cause of there leeving the state & coming to Quincy. the whole city

far west had to surrender to the melitia the Presidency with about 60 others was cast into prision & cha

ins, they are all delivered excepting eleven persons the mob used ever[y] exertion to take the life of Joseph

& others but through the mercy of God there lives were in the hands of God & not there enemies. Elder

David W. Patten one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints

chosen to bear the keys of this last kingdom was one of the marters of the persecution in Missouri

had boldly declared through the U.S.A. for the last 7 years of his life &c. Distance 20 m.

April 26th 1839. The events of this day are worthy of record for a Revelation of God & commandment

is this day fulfilled & that to under circumstances which to all human appearance could not have been done

The Lord had given a commandment to the Twelve to assemble upon the building spot of the house of the Lord

in far west Caldwell Co Mo on the 26th day of April & there take the parting hand with the saints to go to

the nations of the earth. (See Aug 10th 1838) But persecution had arisen to such an highth that about ten 

thousand souls of the saints had been driven from the state, & the city far west almost made desolate &

lade waste while at the same time the Presidency Joseph & his council with other Elders were in prision 

& they had been under the sentance of death several times because of their religion & they would have been put

to death had not the Lord saved them for their lives were in his hands & notwithstanding the lives of those

men were preserved yet there were about thirty five souls martered & put to death David W. Patten one

of the Twelve Apostles were among the martered. And not ownly so but the Missourians had sworn that

the revelation above alluded to should not be fulfilled. It was in the midst of these imbaressments that

we mooved forward to the building spot of the house of the Lord in the city of far west & held a council &

fulfilled the revelation & commandment & took our leave of the saints & rode 32 miles & camped 32 miles

 END_ENTRY Written upon the Death of Elder David W. Patten who was martered in Missouri in 1838, for the

word of God & the testimony of Jesus Christ. He was the first marter of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles

of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints chosen to build up the kingdom of GOD & prepare for the coming of Christ





Hear O earth, Israel thy dark slumber break as the American

gentile trembles at the thought that an angel again should visit

the earth & the abundance of light & truth reveal, which

lays babylons mighty towers in desolations vault, while

Zion proves a refuges for the saint that is prepared for

the second comeing of Jesus Christ. The fulness of times arived

a youth of the loins of ancient Joseph cries to God, the veil

of eternity rends in twain, to earth an angel bends his way

& comforts a Joseph's heart while light & truth enwraps

his soul. Truth startels from the dust to do its work, like the

unicorn Ephraims horns appear in the rolling of the kingdom

of God. to rend the garb of ignorance & superstitions reign, to

make room for the church of Christ as out of the wildern-

ess she comes to stand upon the earth in human view 

with all her perfect body. Twelve apostles of Jesus Christ

were chosen, & DAVID PATTEN whose life with Christ was

hid in God among them stood. & being clothed with the spirit of

his mission he went forth in defence of the word of God. his

voice was herd, from Maine to Missouri he blew the gospel trump

At his command the blind did see, the lame did leap, the

sick were healed, & light & truth prevaled. plain

in his precept faith his constant shield, he feared no

power of earth. By the power of the Holy Ghost oft

the priesthood he confered. Willford received it from

under his hand while the spirit bore testimony of

its truth, but David's earthly mission was of short

duration. seven years closes his apostleship among men

& wafts his faithful soul to a glory celestial. David

hath fallen, did he fall alone, no about thirty of the saint

because of their religion hath found one common grave

& with them American liberty is buried, & cast a dark

stain upon the eagles breast, Because American sons

have her sons oppressed. Missouri is the first her coun

trys laws to disgrace, among her bloody deeds shee's

pierced an Apostle's breast with lead & stolen a valua

ble life, & exterminated ten thousand saints from

the state. Blessed b David who Died in faith, in peace, with

Heber by his side he gave up the GHOST

April 27th We had entered into a covenant to see the poor saints all mooved out of Missouri into Illinois

that they might be delivered from under the hand of such vile persecution & we have spared no pains

to accomplish this object untill the Lord hath given us the desires of our hearts in this thing & we

have now the last company of the poor with us that can be removed. Br Parley P Pratt one of the Twelve

four miles out of town to Mr Cleaveland's to visit Brother Joseph Smith jr & his family. We arived at his house

& once more had the happy privilege of taking Brother Joseph by the hand two years had rolled away since I had

seen his face he greeted us with great Joy. he had just received deliverance from prision & the hand of his enemies

& returned to the bosom of his family & friends & also Hiram his brother & Lyman Wight & two other brethren they

had been confined in prison about six months & had been under the sentence of death three times but yet there lives

were in the hands of God & could not be taken by their enemies & they were now at home & we in their midst

ordained Elders & members of the seventies. I then met Brother Joseph in company with the Twelve &

Bishops at the house of Bishop Partridge we again had an interesting time with Brother Joseph this was the end of

the conference. Several of the Brethren attended this conference that was wounded by the Missouri mob one of which

I will mention which was Brother ISAAC LEANY who was in company with about twenty others at Hawns mill

in upper Missouri when a large armed mob fell upon them with loaded rifles & other weapons & shot down seventeen 

of the saints & murdered them in cool blood. Brother Leany flead from the midst of this seanery & while fleeing

the mob poured forth a shower of balls upon him which pierced his body through & through he showed me

eleven ball holes in his body their was 27 in his shirt, 7 in his pantaloons & his coat literally cut to rags.

one ball entered his body at one armpit & came out at the other another entered the back & came out at

the breast a ball passed through each hip through each leg & each arm all this was while he was running for life

& as strange as it may appear all those wounds with one broken rib did not lessen his speed in the least but he entirely

out run his enemies & saved his life. We can ownly acknowledge it to be by the power & mercy of God

Brother Joseph Young was among the number he also fled & although the balls flew around him like hailstones

yet he was not wounded. How marvelous are the ways of the Lord

& preparing to go on my mission to England.





On the first of June there was a conference held 

in Quincy principly for the benefit of the Seventies Joseph was president of the meeting, & the 

seventies learned that it was not the will of God that they should appoint or have a committy 

or committies to take care of their poor &c. but that Bishops were the authorities that God had 

appointed for that purpose & that they should procede according to that order & they did so 

& gave up the committy which they had appointed





June 20, 1839 ~ Thursday





20th I am quite out of health this day. I had an interview with five of the quorum of 

the Twelve. We feel & believe that it is the most important period & age of the world 

of any since man was upon the earth. We read with much interest the history of Israel

in travling from Egypt to Canaan & search with Interest the prophesies of Isaiah & all 

the prophets in the Bible the stick of Judah. But if possible there is feelings of greater 

interest vibrating our bosoms on reading the Book of Mormon the stick of Joseph in the hands 

of Ephraim to behold the faith manifest of Lehi, Nephi, Alma, Mormon, & Moroni & 

many others I might name who obtained a promise of the Lord by faith that blessings 

should rest upon there seed [FIGURE] JOSEH The Lamanites in the last days. And we now 

behold the Lamanites in these last days still wandering about 

among the gentiles cast down & dejected with nothing more than a blanket upon their naked 

bodies & without the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ or a knowledge of there forefathers. But 

blessed be God for he hath promised them a blessing in these last days even the blessings of the Everlasting 

gospel & it is now to spedily come upon them as not many days hence will show.



 END_ENTRY June 25, 1839 ~ Tuesday





June 25 I spent the day in Montros with the Twelve there being six of the quorum present. Orson 

Hide was one of the number. & a more humble & penitant man I never saw, & well he might be for 

in the time of the persecution in Zion or far west, he deserted the cause, denyed the faith & betrayed 

his brethren, & assisted Thomas B. Marsh (the president of the Twelve Apostles) in jeperdizing the 

lives of Joseph & his council & the whole church in Zion & the blood of the whole of them would 

have been shed if they had not been spared by the immediate hand of God. Brother Hide for several 

months past has had a deep scense of his high handed wickedness & the horrors of hell has roll'd 

oer his soul even to the wasting of his flesh & he has now humbled himself in the dust desire

ing to return to the Church. The manner that O. Hide & T. B Marsh Jepopardized the church 

was by bearing fals testimony against the presidency & the church before the authorities of the 

State of Missouri which was a leading cause of the Governour's calling out thirty thousand 

of the Militia against the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & when the Militia came 

out against the church Col George M. Hinkle (an Elder in church & the one that led the saints as 

they went out to stand in their own defence) sold the presidency & the whole church into the hands 

of the Malitia which were determined on taking our lives, yea Hinkle proved one of the worst of 

traitors that ever occupied a standing on earth yet the Lord deliverd his saints & Blessed be his name





June 26, 1839 ~ Wednesday





26 I crossed the river with the Twelve to Commerce & spent the day in council with the Twelve & two of 

the Presidency Joseph was not present the subject of Br Hide was discused, President Rigdon expressed 

his opinion vary plain & forcably, he said he feared that if Br Hide returned to his quorum that when 

the next trial came he would desert the church as he had done before but said if it was the will 

of God he was willing that Br Hide should return to his quorum.



 

Interesting remarks 

were made from Ephe 1 ch 17, 18 verses. But more esspecially from St. John XIV ch 15 to 31 vers the 

other comforter Note the 23 v. &c.



 END_ENTRY June 27, 1839 ~ Thursday





June 27th I spent the day in Commerce in council with the Presidency & Twelve we had an interesting 

day Joseph was president of the council Brother Orson Hide was restored to the church and the 

quorum of the Twelve in full fellowship by a full vote of the council, after making an humble 

confession & acknowledgement of his sins &c. [FIGURES] Among the vast number of the Keys 

of the kingdom of God Joseph presented the following one to the Twelve for there benefit in there 

experience & travels in the flesh which is as follows. In order to detect the devel when he transforms 

himself nigh unto an angel of light. When an angel of God appears unto man face to face in personage 

& reaches out his hand unto the man ^& he^ takes hold of the angels hand & feels a substance the same as one 

man would in shaking hands with another he may then know that it is an angel of God, & he should 

place all confidence in him such personages or angels are saints with there resurrected Bodies, 

but if a personaged appears unto man & offers him his hand & the man takes hold of it & he feels 

nothing or does not sens any substance he may know it is the devel, for when a saint whose body 

is not resurrected appears unto man in the flesh he will not offer him his hand for this is against 

the law given him & in keeping in mind these things we may detct the devil that he decieved us not.

2d THIS was an interesting day. The First Presidency Joseph & his council came across the river to 

Montrose to spend the day with the Twelve to bless them & their families before they left for other 

Nations. In the fore part of the day we rode four miles down the river to see the place called Blefens 

point whare the saints expected to build a town, Joseph pronounced it good & we returned. the whole

11th We have a heavy gale commenceing

about 1 oclok in the morning & we were in some

danger having the Weltch coast on one side

& the Irish on the other, their was a great

bustle & noise on board arising from the 

Command of the Captain & mates & the singing

of the Sailors & the whistling of the winds & the

roaring of the waters while at the same time the

Ship was pitching & rocking to & fro. We reached

the pilate ground at day light & raised 

Colours for a pilate to come on board

A pilate Boat soon appeared & board came 

came along Side & gave us a pilate, & he

informed us that the Liverpool had not 

yet arived She was a Steem Ship & started 

5 days before us & the Independance had 

not got in & she started 10 days before us. 

The pilate had no sooner came on board before END_ENTRY the Steem Ship Liverpool hove in sight over 

our stern, the pilate ordered the sail to be 

spread notwithstanding it was blowing a gale

we then gained fast of the Liverpool, & their 

was many sail floating upon our right &

left hand. There was much bustle among 

the passengers in shaving, washing & preparing

themselves to go on shore. The City of Liverpool

soon was in sight & an English Steem Boat 

soon came along side & towed us into port 

on the dock in Liverpool we got along side of the

Ilus Carter, & one to Phebe

January 12, 1840 ~ Sunday





12 Sunday I arose in the morning & took 

(Breakfast shall I say) I eat it is true, & used 

a peace of bread for a plate & my fingers 

for a knife & fork & was charged high for 

it at that. I herd some of the passengers boast 

of the superior accomodations in England to 

those of Americe. I confess I could not 

eat without smileing thinking if this is the 

superior English accomodations I do not 

know what those of the next Nation will 

be. I would not wish the reader to under

stand this to be a proper sample of English 

customs. but ownly as we were strangers 

we had the misfortune to be directed to 

a place of the above description. We paid 

our Bill & retired. We walked to the shiping & END_ENTRY through a number of the streets & called at 

M. Seymour Rotunda Place No. 7 Waterloo road 

to spend the day & night. After Dining I atten

ded meeting at St Pauls Church & also 

St Thomas'es Church both of the Church 

of England. It was singular to hear these 

Rectors & Curits preach against the form 

of Godliness without the power of it, while 

at the same [time] their is no people perhaps 

more formal than themselves. I also 

Attended meeting at Pitt Stree Methodist Chapel

the speaker appeared quite easy & simple 

in his manners. all of the above named chapels 

were quite splended with the stand near 

the Centre of the house which is the English 

Costom they bury their dead in the yard 

all around their Church & lay the grave 

stones flat upon the ground & it forms 

a pavement to walk upon. I find the people 

both rich & poor, male & female to be m

uch more plain in their dress than those 

of America. I returned to M Seymour

& spent the night END_ENTRY January 13, 1840 ~ Monday





Jan 13th I took Breakfast & went on board of the Oxford 

& found the passengers taking their trunks & goods 

on shore to go to the Costom house to be exa

mined & I found it to be a scene of the 

greatest confusion I ever past though 

but after much jaming crouding 

& mucking about we were permited 

to depart with our things after paying 

6 pense per lbs for all the books we had 

as duty upon them. The trunkman then 

took our trunks & Boxes to Mr

George Cannon Norfork Street No 43 

he was a Brother in Law of Elder Taylors 

we deposited our provision chest & a 

box containing our bed & beding wi

th him. We took our trunks 

& went to the rail road depo & their 

took a car for Preston Lancashire 

England & for the first mile the cars run 

under ground on a track that was cut 

out of a solid rock while their was building 

& inhabitants over our heads. [FIGURES] {victory to the crown} 

We started from Liverpool about 6 oclock & END_ENTRY arived in Preston about 8 oclock & called at 

Brother Greenwoods they immediately sent 

for Elder Richards & in a few moments 

I had Elder Willard Richards by the hand & 

I truly rejoiced to once more behold 

his face. We immediately went to 

his house & after spending most of the 

night in Conversation we retired to 

rest Distance of the day 35 miles 

January 14, 1840 ~ Tuesday





14th I spent the day in Preston writing 

& visiting the Saints. I dined at Brother

John Parkinson & Elder Francis Mood. I 

took supper with Brother Robert Smith

& spent the night with Elder Richards 

in Meadow Street newhouse oposite No 3. 

I found the Saints in Preston poor but 

having warm hearts. Preston has a 

population of about 60,000 the streets 

were crouded with the poor both ma

le & female going to & from the fac

tories with their wodden or Clogg Shoes 

an which makes a great ratling over 

the pavement the poor are in as great END_ENTRY Bondage as the Children of Israel in Egypt 

I find that Elder Richards has had a hard 

school to pass through since he has been in 

England. I see that we have a great work 

to perform & we have need of much faith 

& humility before God 

January 15, 1840 ~ Wednesday





15th I dined at Brother Worselys & suped at 

Sister Dawsons & sp at Elder

the brain she was rageing & trying to 

tare herself although in the hands of 

three or four men. We lade hands END_ENTRY upon her & commanded the devil to 

Depart, & the fever to stand rebuked in the 

name of Jesus Christ & it was done 

though not without a great struggle &

French Italic, & music in the families of some of the first

Lords in London, but afterwards moved to New York & there

embraced the gospel {Elder Ball baptized her} she was sick nigh unto

death, with the Liver complaint, & she was advised by her

friends to take a sea voyage in order to save her life, an

English Gentleman came forward, & gave her $300 dollars

for the yoyage. She was a widow & had 3 children, & as END_ENTRY She is firm & unmoved in the great cause in which

she is ingaged. My Prayer is that Peace health &

Strength may rest upon her & her children & may

thou wilt but work & send by whom thou wilt

but send, that thy cause may roll on in this city

the greatest curiosities in London or the world viz 

the Eastern wine vault. This is much the Largest 

Wine vault in the world, it is altogether under ground 

& covers nine English acres the whole vault is supported 

with tremendous arches & pillars, & lade of in the form 

of streets, we had the streets & city overhead we walked 

through the length & bredth of this vault with a guide 

each one carrying a lighted lamp in his hand, this vault 

was has been built 33 years. This vault alone contained 

30,000 Pipes of the best Port wine & 6,000 pipes of 

wherry & three others vaults of great magnitude filled 

with the same article, besides many thousands of 

Pipes of wine, Brandy, Gin, & other liquors strewed thro-

ughed all the Docks wharfs & storehouses, we had a 

tasting order & found the wine a good article, But 

it seemed dreadful to see such vast sums of money 

expended for intoxicating drinks when there are 

thousands nearly starving for bread in the streets. We 

left this scenery & called into a Jewish Synagogue 

[FIGURE] & attended a meeting of the Jews they all worship 

with their hats on. We returned to our Room, I called

by tens of thousands, for the purpose of having a 

view of her Majesty [FIGURE] Queen Victoria as she passed thro-

in person. Long before 2 oclock the whole line from 

Buckingham Palace through St Jamess Park along 

Whitehall & Parliament Street leading to the House of 

Lords, was one continuous mass of the inhabitants 

of the Metropolis & of all classes. The windows of the 

houses in Parliament Street Whitehall, & Richmond 

terrace were occupied by fashionable Dressed ladies 

while on Richmond terrace and on the steps at the base 

of the Duke of York's Column were immense bodies of people 

(It was Judged there was from 3 to 400,000 Persons 

gatherd together on the occasion, yet notwithstandind 

this immens Body of People we had the good fortune to

(through the favor of one of the Queens Horslife guards) to get 

a place in the front line. Her Majesty started a quarter 

before 2 oclock. The cortege consisted of five carriages 

containing the attendants upon Royalty, & the State Carriage 

in which were her Majesty & Prince Albert who sat on her 

left, & the Mistress of the Robes, & Master of the Horse 

The Queen's Body Guard was formed by the Royal Horse Guard 

(Blue) The life guards did duty on the line. The State Carriage 

containing Her Majesty & Prince Albert was drawn by 

8 cream colored Hanovarian Horses





the whole train passed within 10 feet of us so that we had 

a fair & perfect view of the Queen & Prince Albert 

both going to & returning from the house of Lords. Her 

Majesty is small in stature very plain in features & Dress 

Her costume was of white satin trimed with lace she wore a 

necklace of brilliants. Prince Albert appeared like is 

quite a good looking man. They Bowed to us as they passed 

& we returned the compliment. It was the grandest 

earthly scenery I ever beheld. Her Majesty was conducted 

to the Throne by Prrince Albert & after she read 

her speech she again returned to the Palace and appeared 

much fatigued

to some length on the kingdom of God

& the baptism of John, he said the kingdom 

of God was set upon the earth in all ages 

from the days of Adam to the presant 

time whenever there was a man on earth 

who had authority to Administer the 

ordinances of the gospel or a priest of God 

& unto such a man God did reveal his will 

concerning the Baptism of John it was 

the baptism of repentance unto the remission 

of sins for the receiving of the Holy Ghost

& it was the gospel Baptism. These were 

questions which had been in debate for 

many years & in some degree among the 

Saints. He also spoke upon the subject 

of honor & dishonor &c many prayers &

exhertations were made I spoke twice &

felt much of the spirit of the Lord & had an

22nd Sunday President Joseph  Smith 

deliverd an interesting discourse at the

Temple to an inter large congregation among

other things he treated upon the kingdom

of God & the baptism of John. He remarked 

["]some say the kingdom of God was not set 

up on earth untill the day of pentecost & that 

John did not preach the baptism of repen

tance for the remission of sins. But I say in 

the name of the Lord that the kingdom 

of God was set upon earth from the days 

of Adam to the present time whenever 

there has been a righteous man on earth unto 

whom God revealed his word & gave power 

& authority to administer in his name: 

And whare theire is a Priest of God, A minister 

who has power & Authority from God to 

administer in the ordinances of the Gospel 

& officiate in the Priesthood of God, theire 

is the kingdom of God & in consequence 

of rejecting the gospel of Jesus Christ & the 

Prophets whom God hath sent, the judgm-

ents of God hath rested upon people, cities &

nations in various ages of the world, which 

was the case with the cities of Sodom & gomo-

roah who were destroyed for rejecting the 

Prophets. Now I will give my testimony

I care not for man I speak boldly & faith-

fully & with authority. How is it with the 

kingdom of God, whare did the kingdom 

of God begin, whare their is no kingdom 

of God their is no salvation. What consti-

tutes the kingdom of God



 END_ENTRY Whare there is a prophet, a priest, or a righ-

teous man unto whom God gives his oracles 

there is the kingdom of God, & whare the

oracles of God are not there the kingdom 

of God is not. In these remarks I have 

no allusion to the kingdoms of the earth, we 

will keep the Laws of the Land, we do not 

speak against them, we never have, & we 

can hardly make mention of the State 

of Missouri of our persecutions there &c 

but what the cry goes forth that we are 

guilty of larceny, Bur[g]lary, arson treason &

murder &c &c which is fals, we speak of 

the kingdom of God on the earth not the 

kingdoms of mem. The plea of many in 

this day is that we have no right to receive 

revelations. But if we do not get revelations 

we do not have the oracles of God & if they 

have not the oracles of God they are not

the people of God. But say you what will 

become of the world or the various professors 

of religion who do not believe in revelation &

the oracles of God as continued to his 

Church in all ages of the world when he 

has a people on earth. I Tell you in the 

name of Jesus Christ they will be damned 

& when you get into the eternal 

world you will find it to be so they cannot 

escape the damnation of hell





As touching the gospel & baptism that John

preached I would say that John came preach-

ing the gospel for the remission of sins he 

had his authority from God & the oricles 

of God were with him & the kingdom of [God]



 END_ENTRY for a season seemed to rest be with John

alone. The Lord promised Zecheriah that he 

should have a son, which was a desendant 

of Aaron & the Lord promised that the 

priesthood should continue with Aaron & his 

seed throughout their generations.

Let No man take this honour upon himself 

except he be called of God as was Aaron, &

Aaron received his Call by Revelation. An 

angel of God Also appeared unto Zecheriah 

while in the Temple [and said] that he should have a 

son whose name should be John & he should 

be filled with the Holy Ghost. Zechariah was 

a priest of God & officiating in the Temple &

John was a priest after his father & held the keys

of the aronic priesthood & was called of God 

to preache the Gospel & the kingdom of God

& the Jews as a nation having departed 

from the Law of God & the gospel the Lord 

prepared the way for transfering it to the gentiles

But says one the kingdom of God could 

not be set up in the days of John for John 

said the Kingdom was at hand. But I would 

ask if it could be any nearer to them than 

to be in the hands of John, the people need 

not wait for the days of Pentecost to find 

the kingdom of God for John had it with 

him, & he came forth from the wilderness 

crying out repent ye for the kingdom of 

heaven is at hand as much as to kaul out 

here I have got the kingdom of God & I am 

coming after you. Ive got the kingdom 

of God & you can get it & I am coming 

after you & if you dont receive it you 

will be damned & the scriptures represant 



 END_ENTRY that all Jerrusalem went out unto Johns Baptism

Here was a legal administrator, & those that were 

baptized were subjects for a king & also the laws 

& oracles of God were there therefore the king-

dom of God was there, for no man could have 

better authority to Administer than John &

our Savior submitted to that authority himself 

by being baptized By John therefore the 

kingdom of God was set up upon the earth 

even in the days of John their is a difference 

between the kingdom of God & the fruits &

blessings that flow from that kingdom 

becaus their was more miracles, gifts, gracsvisions 

healings, tongues &c in the days of Jesus Christ 

& the Apostles & on the day of pentecost than 

under Johns Administration, it does not 

prove by any means that John had not the 

kingdom of God; any more than it would 

that a woman had not a milk pan because she 

had not a pan of milk, for while the pan might 

be compared to the kingdom the milk might 

be compared to the blessings of the kingdom

John was a priest after the order of Aaron

& had the keys of that priesthood & came forth 

preaching repentance & baptism for the remis-

sion of sins but at the same time crys out 

there cometh one after me more mighter than 

I the latches of whose shoes I am not worthy 

to unlose, & Christ came according to the words of 

John, & he was greater than John because he 

held the keys of Melchisedic Priesthood

& the kingdom of God & had before revealed the 

priesthood to Moses, yet Christ was baptised 

by John to fulfill all righteousness & Jesus 

in his teaching says upon this rock I will 

build my Church & th[e] gates of hell shall not



 END_ENTRY prevail against it. what rock, Revelation

Again he says except ye are born of the water 

& the spirit ye cannot inter into the kingdom 

of God, and though the heavens & earth 

should pass away my words shall not pass away

If a man is born of the water & the spirit

he can get into the kingdom of God

it is evident the kingdom of God was on 

the earth & John prepared subject[s] for 

kingdom by preaching the gospel to them 

& baptising them & he prepared the way d◊◊

before the Savior or came as a fore runner 

& prepared subject for the preaching of 

Christ, & & Christ preached through 

Jerrusalem on the same ground whare 

John had preached & when the Apostles were 

raised up they worked in Jerrusalem

& Jesus commanded them to tarry there 

untill they were endowed with power from 

on high had they not work to do in Jer

rusalem, they did work, & prepared a 

people for the pentecost. The kingdom of 

God was with them before the day of pen-

tecost as well as afterwords & it was also 

with John & he preached the same gospel 

& baptism that Jesus & the Apostles preached 

after him. The endowment was to 

prepare the desiples for their mission in to 

the world. Whenever men can find out 

the will of God & find an Administrator 

legally authorized from God there is the 

kingdom of God but whare these are not, the 

kingdom of God is not. All the ordinances

systems, & Administrations on the earth is 

of no use to the children of men unless

for nothing will save a man but a leger [legal] 

Administrator for none others will be

thei I know what I say, I understand 

my mishion & business. God Almighty is my 

shield & what can man do if God is my 

friend I shall not be sacrafised untill 

my time comes then I shall be offered 

freely, all flesh is is as grass & a governor 

is no better than other men when he dies he 

is but a bag of dung I thank God for preserving 

me from my enemies I have no enmity 

I have no desire but to do all men good I feel 

to pray for all men we dont ask any people 

to throw away any good they have got 

we ownly ask them to come & get more 

what if all the world should embrace this 

gospel they would then see eye to eye & the 

blessings of God would be poured out upon 

the people which is my whol Soul Amen["]

Feb 18th We left Stone & walked to Stoke 

but on the road we spent several hours in 

visiting the Noted Park of [FIGURE] George Granvill 

the Present DUKE [FIGURE] of Southerland Trentam 

Staffordshire. This park is about 5 miles in length & 

5 in bredth, the first thing of note that strike the atten

tion while cuming on the rode from Stone to Stoke is 

several hundred acres of ground planted over with 

young sprouts in order to make timber, which ground is 

hilly. next appears Spring Vale, the lower fountain is a 

forced vein which spirts or throws a stream of water about 

12 feet above the surface of the water, their is a fish pool 

above the first fountain, but rather small, their is a 

splendid stone house, on the hill above for the purpose of 

keeping persons that are Insane. there are a number 

of small monuments around this vale. The next is the 

manner house built of stone but mostly in ruins, it is 

more than five hundred years old, & one family have 

lived in it more than 200 years ie desending from father



 END_ENTRY to Son. We next visited the splended Monument erected 

in memory of George Granvill the late Duke father of the 

present Duke of Southerland. It stands erect upon a hill 

built of hewn stone, the foundation is square 160 ^feet^ round 

it, each laying of stone is drawn into a narrow Compase

about 3 feet each laying untill about 12 feet high then the 

monument is round for about 60 feet, then the Image 

of the Duke stands on the top being about 10 feet in hight 

with a roll of paper in his left hand (he was a memder 

of parliment) facing his splended mansion house in the vale 

north of the monument. the whole monument about 80 

feet in hight [FIGURE] A person at this monument has a fine view 

of the mansion house which is an expensive & splended build

ing it covers about 4 acres built of hewn stone, having 

much carved work of Lions & other Images, their were

365 windows in it before the repairs or additions which the 

present Duke is making which it is supposed will take 7 

years to accomplish. Their are some hundreds of acres of 

wood land & firm paches all of which are enclosed with 

a fence of 4 & 5 feet high the whole of the fence composed 

of Solid Iron their are miles of Iron railing in this park 

The Duke Has vast quantities of game, fish & fowl in his

Park, such as Deer, Hares, Rabits, Pheasants, Ducks, Geese 

Swan, Trout & many other kinds of fish. The Deer are 

as tame as Sheep we saw about 300 in one drove. there 

are game keepers to see that no person trespasses upon 

the park, the river Trent runs through the park the

Duke has converted the whole of it for a distance into 

a fish pool. I visited the burying ground which was 

coverd with many kinds of evergreen, the publick road 

running through the park is betwen two stone walls 

about 10 feet thick, 4 to 6 high coverd with turf & green grass 

This DUKE of Southerland has two other Parks of 

as much value as the one above named, as to his wealth 

he nor no man knoweth. But as JESUS said concer

ning the Stones of the Temple, it will in like manner be with 

the monuments & pride of this generation, they will spedily 

be lade low in the Dust together.

3rd I walked to Stafford & called at the kings 

Inn. I had an interview with Mr



 END_ENTRY the saints of God gatherd, Zion built up, & the 

saints to come up as saviors on mount Zion 

but how are they to become Saviors on Mount 

Zion by building their temples erecting their 

Baptismal fonts & going forth & receiving all 

the ordinances, baptisms, confirmations, washings 

anointings ordinations, & sealing powers upon 

our heads in behalf of all our Progenitors who 

are dead & redeem them that they may come 

forth in the first resurrection & be exhalted to 

thrones of glory with us, & herein is the chain 

that binds the hearts of the fathers to the children, 

& the children to the Fathers which fulfills 

the mission of Elijah & I would to God that 

this temple was now done that we might go 

into it & go to work & improve our time & 

make use of the seals while they are on earth 

& the saints have none to much time to save 

& redeem their dead, & gather together their 

living relatives that they may be saved also, before 

the earth will be smitten & the consumption 

decreed falls upon the world & I would advise 

all the saints to go to with their might & gather 

together all their living relatives to this place that 

they may be sealed & saved that they may 

be prepared against the day that the destroying 

angel goes forth & if the whole Church should 

go to with all their might to save their dead

seal their posterity & gather their living friends 

& spend none of their time in behalf of the 

world they would hardly get through before 

night would come when no man could work 

& my ownly trouble at the present time 

is concerning ourselves that the saints 

will be divided & broken up & scattered



 END_ENTRY before we get our salvation secure for 

thei[r] is so many fools in the world for the devil 

to operate upon it gives him the advantage 

often times. The question is freequently 

asked can we not be saved without going 

through with all thes ordinances &c I would 

answer no not the fulness of salvation, 

Jesus said their was many mansions in his 

fathers house & he would go & prepare a 

place for them. House here named should 

have been translated Kingdom & any 

person who is exhalted to the highest mansion 

has to abide a celestial law & the whole law 

to. But their has been a great difficulty 

in getting anything into the heads of this 

generation it has been like splitting hemlock 

knots with a corn doger for a wedge & a 

pumpkin for a beetle; even the saints are 

slow to understand I have tried for a number 

of years to get the minds of the saints prepared 

to recieve the things of God, but we freequently 

see some of them after suffering all they have 

for the work of God will fly to peaces like glass 

as soon as any thing comes that is contrary to 

their traditions, they cannot stand the 

fire all at all. How many will be able to abide 

a celestial law & go through & recieve their 

exhaltation I am unable to say but many are 

called & few are chosen

Feb 3d 1844 I walked into President Joseph 

Smith store or office over the store & spent a few 

moments in conversing with Elders W Richards 

A\and Wm W. Phelps & President Joseph Smith. 

Smith came into the room & said he had a dream 

& related it to us which was as follows.





[FIGURE] I was standing on a peninsula in the midst 

of a vast body of water whare their appears 

to be a large harbor or a peer built out for boats 

to come into. I was surrounded by my friends

& while looking at this harbor I saw a Steem 

boat approaching the harbour, their was bridges 

on the peer for persons to cross & there 

came up a wind & drove the steem boat 

under one of the bridges & upset it. I run 

up to the boat expecting the persons would all 

drowne and wishing to do sumthing to assist 

them. I put my hand against the side of the 

boat & with one surge I shoved it under the bridge 

& righ[t]ed it up & then told them to take care of 

themselves. But it was not long before I saw 

them starting out into the channel or main body 

of the water again. The storms were raging & 

the waters rough. I said to my friends that if 

they did not understand the signs of the times 

& the spirit of Prophecy they would be



 END_ENTRY apted to be lost. It was but a few moments after

when we saw the waves break over the boat &

she soon founderd & went down with all on

board & perished the storm & waters were still

vary rough, yet I told my friends around me

that I believed I could stem those waves & storm

& swim in the waters better than the steem boat

did & at any rate I was determined to

try it but my friends laughed at me & told

me I could not stand the storm at all but should

be drouned, the waters looked clear & beautif

ul though exeeding rough, & I said I believed I

could swim & I would try it anyhow they said

I would drown. I said I would have a frolic in

the water first if I did, & I dove of[f] in to the

raging waves. I had swum but a short distance

when a towering wave overwhelmed me for

a time but I soon found myself on the top

of it & soon I met the second wave

in the same way & for awhile I struggled hard to

live in the midst of the storm & waves but

I soon found I gained upon evry wave &

stemmed the torrent better & better

& I soon had power to swim with my

head out of water so the waves did

not break over me at all, & I found I had

swam a great distance & in looking about me

I saw Br Samuel by my side. I asked him

how he liked it he said first rate & I thought

so to. I was soon enabled to swim with

my head & sholdiers out of water & I could

swim as fast as any steem boat, & in a

little time it becaim calm & I could rush

through the water & ownly go in to my loins

& so[o]n I ownly went in to my knees & finall[y]



 END_ENTRY could tread on the top of the water & went

almost with the speed of an arrow & I

said to Samuel see how swift I can go & i though[t]

it was great sport & pleasure to travel with

such speed & I awoke.

dream was the spirit of God or time must

8th It is still cold, I spent the day at home.

But I met with a congregation of the citizens

in the room over Joseph store for the purpose

of hearing the views of General Joseph Smith

given concerning the affairs of government

his views were written & were re^a^d by Wm. W Phelps

& were in the highest degree interesting. Gen

Smith gave his reasons for permitting his name to

go forth as a candidate for the Presidency of

The United States, which were as follows I would

not have suffered my name to have been used by

my friends on any wise as president of the united

States or candidate for that office If I & my

friends could have had the privilege of enjoying

our religious & civel rights as American Citizen

even those rights which the Constitution guarantee

unto all her citizens alike but this we as a

people have been denied from the beginning. Persecution

has rolled upon our heads from time to time from

portions of the United States like peels of thunde[r]

7th Thursday March 1844 

A Vast assembly of saints met at the 

Temple of the Lord at 9 oclock AM by a 

special appointment of President Smith 

for the purpose of advancing the progress 

of the Temple &c. The quorum of the 

Twelve were present. Temple committee & 

six or eight thousand saints, the corrister was 

called to the stand by president Young. A Hymn was 

then sung & prayer by P. P. Pratt followed by a Hymn 

Elder Young arose and said the Patriarch was near

he came & took the stand & remarked the object 

of the meeting was to stir up your minds by way 

of rememberence it is necessary to have a starting 

point is to build the temple with the assistance



 END_ENTRY of the Sisters we expect to get the nails & glass 

& with the assistance of the Brethren we expect to 

do the rest. I will proclaim in publick & in private 

that the sisters bought the glass & nails by penny 

subscription. Chuse ye this day wholm ye will 

serve. We shall call upon this vast multitude 

for a donation to buy powder & fuse rope. We 

want the brethren to do as much as the sisters. 

We do not intend to finish the Nauvoo House 

this season but to finish the Temple this summer 

or the walls of it & get the roof on by December 

& do of the inside next winter & about a year 

from this spring we will dedicate it we can 

do any thing we undertake we have power & we 

can do great things. In 5 years to come the work 

will progress more than it has for 10 years past 

Isaiah said we should perform a marvelous work 

and a wonder. I dont wonder he said so if he 

saw this vast multitude & I think this people is 

abundantly able to build this temple & much depends 

upon it our endowments & sealing powers & many 

blessings depend upon it. The Prophet arived & 

took the stand and arose in the midst of the 

said (Orson Pratt come & take your post) & further 

remarked I do not know whether the object 

of the meeting has been told or not I apologize for not 

comeing sooner. I have had so much on my mind 

since I saw you that I hardly know whare to 

begin or to say but one of the grand objects that 

I had in view in calling this meeting was in making 

a few remarks relative to the laws & ordinances 

and building the temple, the reason I want to 

speak of the laws is the officers have difficulty 

in administering the laws. We are republican & 

wish to have the people rule but rule in righteousness



 END_ENTRY So [no]ne would complain with what God himself 

would do, the laws are enacted by petition and 

they can all be repealed if they wish it but the 

people ought not to complain of the officers but 

to complain of the law makers. I am instructed 

by the city council to tell this people that if you do 

not like any law we have passed we will repeal it 

for we are your servants. Any that complain of 

our rights and charters it is because they are 

wicked the devil is in them. the reason I called 

it up is we have a simple gang of fellows who 

does not know whare their elbows or head is if 

you preach virtue to them they will oppose that if 

you preach Methodist God to them they will oppose 

that or any thing els & if their is any case tried 

they want it appealed to Carthage. Mr Boswicks case 

had to go to Carthage our Lawyers will send any 

thing to Carthage. I want to know if the citizens 

will sustain me when my hands are raised to heaven 

for the people. I will areign the person before the 

people that act against the interest of the city & 

I will have the voice of the people which is republican 

and as likely to be the voice of God. And as long as

long as long as I have a tongue to speak I will expose 

the iniquity of the Lawyiers and wicked men 

I fear not their boiling over nor their boiling over

nor the boiling over of Hell their thunders & forked 

lightning. I despise the man that will betray you with 

a kiss. Here is Hiram Kimball has set at naught

the ordinances of the city. By saying that He owns 

the wharf & steem boats need not pay them. 

wharefore this body is the highest court what appeal 

to Carthage I would not appeal there if i died a 

thousand deaths. Kimball nor Morrison does not 

own the wharfage Water Street runs along the



 END_ENTRY beach. & belongs to the city & not individuals

I will reprove the lawyers & docters any how

Jesus did & evry prophet has & if I am a prophet

I shall do it, at any rate I shall do it for i profess

to be a prophet. The laws & constitution of the

United States has ended up the right to corperate

cities to regulate all wharfage of shiping & steem

boats &c all laws of taxation is subject to the

city & not individuals. And I want from this

time forth evry fool to stay at home & let the steem

boats & captain alone and let the peace officers alone.

How can we keep off mobs & keeping innocent blood

from being shed, by striking a blow at evry thing tha[t]

rises up in disorder & I will war an eternal war with

those that oppose me while I am labouring in behalf

of the city. A man has been writing to the New York

Tribune. I will not mention his name. He says

that much has been appropriated for the building the

Temple that has been spent for other purposes.

But I pledge myself that any man that has paid any

old shoes, harnesses, horses, or any thing els if he will

come I will show him on book that evry farthi[n]g

has gone on book & been appropriated for the

building of the Temple if not so I will pledge

my head for a foot ball that this is true their

are men in our midst who are trying to build up themse

lves at our expense & others in our midst that are

watching for iniquity & will make a man an offender

for a word. But I will rest myself & give way for

others. President Hyram Smith arose and made

some singular remarks quite romantic compared

the lawyiers to polewags & wiglers & toads. He said

they would dry up next fall these characters

he thought was made in gigard making time

when it was cheaper then in soul making time



 END_ENTRY A Brother of Dr Foster threatend the mayor

& the mayor fined him $10.

President Joseph Smiths views of the goverment

was then read, which was recieved with universal

applause Gen Smith is now nominated by the saints

as a candidate for President of the U.S.A. next election.

An article was also read headed a voice of innocence

from Nauvoo, and a meeting of the female relief

society was appointed to attend to the above. writing

meeting adjourned 1 1/2 hours. During intermission

the Twelve met with the seventies & they passed

a resolution to build the hall of the seventies one

story higher for the Presidency





Meeting commenced again at 2 oclok commenced by

singing & prayer by O. Pratt sing a hymn.

President B Young arose and addressed the assembly

relative to different subjects as men have been

spoken of in their capacity. I wish to speak of the

duty of the claass of lawyiers classing myself with

the lawyers in the house of Israel and when any

man who is a Lawyer will take a course to break peace

instead of making it is out of the way of his duty

any doctor of the Law should read the law and make

peac. The grand object we have before us is to

build the Temple this season. We have herd the

effects of slander & we want a cure & balm & I

carry one with me all the while & I want all to do

the same & I will tell you what it is. it is to mind

our own business & let others alone and suffer wrong

rather than to do wrong if any one takes your

property away let them alone have nothing to do

with them. A spirit has been manifest to divide

the saints it was manifest in the last election

it was said if they did not look out the saints

February 20, 1845 ~ Thursday





Feb 20th 1845. This was a solmen & gloomy 

day to my feelings in some respect, in consequence 

of walking over the ground which oft had been 

trod by the much lamented & worthy— 

ELDER LORENZO. D. BARNES And also of 

viewing the tomb whare sleeps his Sacred Dust. 

I Left Bradford in company with Elders Sheets 

& Ure. Br Sheets is presiding over the Bradford 

Conference the one that Elder Barnes was presiding 

over when he died. Br Ure is presiding over the 

Sheffield branch of the church ^sheffield conference^. We left Bradford 

together for the purpose of visiting the grave of Elder 

Barnes in Idle Yorkshire 3 miles from Bradford

when we arived about half way we have a fair 

view of Idle & the Church whare lies the grave of 

Elder Barnes, we had a beautiful green vale to 

pass through before ariving at Idle, which is on 

top of a hill. the fields of grass were as green 

as may, though in Febuary which made a splendid 

appearence. We travelled on the Road that 

Elder Branes had walked over many scores of 

times in Preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ

I felt solumn indeed. was filled with meditation 

untill I arived at Idle containing a Population of



 END_ENTRY [FIGURE]



 END_ENTRY of about 7000 inhabitants & a branch of 

the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 

of 37 members. We called upon Elder Thomas 

Cordingly & his family who had the care of 

Elder Barnes through his sickness & death, they 

Pointed out the house & room to me whare he 

was sick spent his last hours, passed through his 

last sickness afflictions & Death. After getting 

some refreshment we walked to the Church yard 

& I gazed upon the silent grave of our beloved 

Brother & Elder Lorenzo Barnes. My feelings were 

keene & sensitive. As I stood upon his grave I 

realized I was standing over the body of one of 

the Elders of Israel of the horns of Joseph, of the 

Seed of Ephraim, one of the members of Zions 

Camp, who had travelled more than 1000 miles 

in 1844 for the redemption of his persecuted, 

afflicted brethren, Offered to lay down his life 

for their sake, One who had the hearts & affection 

of thousands both in America & England, one 

who felt a deep interest in the welfare of his parents 

and kindred, One whose fidelity was stronger 

than death towards his Lover, his brethren 

eternal truth, & his God. While Standing upon 

his grave I offered up my vocal Prayer to Israels 

God, that I might die the death of the righteous 

when called away, & that my last end might be 

as wise & safe as his & that his sacred dust 

might be called forth in the morn of the first 

resurrection. I decreed in my heart I 

would not return to my native country untill 

I had causced to be erected a tomb stone over 

his grave to say to his friends that should chance 

to pass that way, that here sleeps the worthy 

LORENZO. D. BARNES 

The first of Zions Camp who has found a grave in a foreign Land



 END_ENTRY I bowed my knees upon this sacred grave & plucked 

some pebbles in memory of his worth. I thought 

of his [FIGURE] Lover, his Mother, his Father, his kindred 

& the saints for they all loved him, & would have 

thought it a privilege blessing to have been permitted 

to have droped a silent tear upon his lonely bed. 

O Lorenzo thou has fallen, in thy youth as it 

were A marter for the truth, in a foreign 

land. But if thy God permits me to tread again 

the Courts of his house, in Zions land. & have 

access to the sealing powers, endowments, & keys of 

the kingdom of God I'll remember thee & pray 

that thy exhaltations [FIGURE] may not come short 

of the Chiefest of thy quorums





I retired from his grave in company with my 

brethren meditating upon the life of Br Barnes. 

I made dilligent enquiry of the family whare 

he died & of others concerning his sickness & death 

And I obtained the following information.



 

 That Elder Barnes during the last of Sept 

walked one day about 13 miles vary fast to get 

to the rail road in time to get the cars some part of 

the way he run, got into a high state of perspiration 

& ownly had time to step on board just as they 

were about starting. he rode on the rail road 

about 20 miles, during which time he became 

entirely chilled, which flung him into a sever cold 

that settelled upon his lungs brought on the quick 

consumption from which he never recovered

He attended a conference & Preached several 

times afterwards but was vary feble. The last 

time he Preached was from the following words 

"There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of 

God" After he was confined to his bed he was 

asked if he would have a Physician his answer



 END_ENTRY was deffinately No. if he Died he wished to 

Die a natural death. if he lived he should live 

unto the Lord, if he died he should die unto 

the Lord. He manifested a great desire to lifve 

if it was the will of God that he might again 

return to Nauvoo. He was deprived of his 

reason ^during^ some portion of his sickness his 

whole conversation at such times was about 

Nauvoo, how he should get there, & his 

friends, spoke of his mother freequently. 

The night before his death, he had his reason 

& bore a strong & faithful testimony of the 

truth of the fulness of the Gospel as taught 

by the Latter Day Saints. Stated that it would 

not be long before the Kings & great men of 

the earth would call for the mountains & rocks 

to fall upon them to hide them from the wrath 

of the Lamb of God that was to be poured out 

upon the earth for soon would the nations 

of the earth be deluged with the judgments of 

God, & with many other words did he testify 

of those things that would spedily come to 

Pass. I learned that Elder Barnes 

suffered by going with poor boots & wet feets 

from place to Place. He was slow to make his 

wants known to the brethren & some were 

to slow to administer to his wants untill he 

got sick. But evry attention was paid him 

after he was confined to his bed but it was to 

late.





I enquired if their was any writings that he 

left as a Journals but could find nothing but 

the following lines as a correspondance in Poetry 

between himself & his intended Miss Susan Conrad 

which shows the strong fidelity of his heart 

which was Characterestic of the man throug evry 

action of his lifife

Lines from Susan in Hebrew Lovely Jan 1st 1842





Strive then to remember me

Untill life shall scease to be

Sweet twill be to think on thee

And know thou dost remember me.





Nay; to say forget the[e] is vain

Has meditation ceased to reign

Continue true and often send

One thought to a confiding friend





Now if in the festive hall

Remember me remember all

And if away o'er land or sea

Do I Pray remember me





In Answer





1 Lovely and lasting are the thoughts of thy name

O! Susan! O Susan to forget thee would be vain

Rememberance of thee I shall sweetly retain

Ever rejoiceing that true you remain





2 No never fear Susan the victory is ours

Zion we'll inherit and rejoice in its towers

O'er troubles and trials which throng in our path

Determined to conquer we'll triumph at last



 END_ENTRY 3 By the bands of Affection united in love

As Saints let us live, as Saints let us prove

Remembering for each other unceasing to pray

Night after night and day after day





4 Evening and morning I'll think of thee

Susan though Journeying on land or the Sea

Yea night after night and day after day

My thoughts o'er the deep to Susan will stray



  

New York Jan 9th 1842 L.D. Barnes





1 When I bade my home farewell

On Brittons shore far hence to dwell

When I watched by evening light

My native shores fade from my sight

O! Susan then I thought of thee





2. When I ploughed the raging sea

whose Billows rolled continually

When on high our Ship was bourn

Or fiercely driven by winters storm

When roaring surges dashed oer me

O Susan then I thought of thee





3 When I gazed with eager eyes

On Britons shores before me rise

I viewed her mountains capt.d with snow

While chilling winds did round me blow

Till late our haven hove in view

O Susan then I thought of you





4th When on Europes Shores I stood

And gazed far oer old oceans flood

I thought of all I'd left behind

My Parents dear And friends so kind



 END_ENTRY I thought of their [illegible] company

But Susan most I thought of thee





5 When I the streets of towns perade

And gaze upon proud Britons maids

With sparkling eyes and silken hair

With rosy cheeks and bosoms fair

Methinks they have no chairms for me

For Susan yet I think on thee





6 When wafted by the power of steam

Through landscapes fair and meadows green

Through wide spread fields of waving grain

Mid wood land hills or on the plain

Though swift I fly and fair my view

Yet Susan then I think of you





7th When amid my foreign friends

A cheerful hour I try to spend

Whare kindness beams in on evry face

And danties rich our feastings grace

Mid all these scenes our hearts are true

That heart which's Susans placed on you





8th When before Jehovah's Throne

I bow and all my wants make known

I ask for blessings on my friends

And heavenly grace my stepts to attend

While thus in prayer I bow my knee

O! Suthesan then I pray for thee

July 28, 1843 ~Friday





28th We spent the fore part of the day 

walking about. We met in council at 

2 oclok at Br Richard Savorry Elder B Young 

enquired concerning the procedings of the Twelve 

at Cincinnati found that Elders H C Kimball, O Pratt 

& J. E Page held a conference organized the church 

& left for Pittsburgh Elder Page stayed & in 

few days disunnoled what had been done



 END_ENTRY & reorganized the Church but it left the Church 

in no better situation. Elder Young reproved 

Elder Page some for undoing alone what three 

of the quorum had done together. He also spoke 

of the instruction that Br Joseph spoke of 

ie to be gentle & mild in our teaching & not to 

Battle the Sects any more at present but win 

the affections of the people, we had a good time 

to the people together

we met in the evening at Jeremiah Cooper's house

I opened the meeting by Prayer Elder B 

Young arose & addressed the Saints in a vary inter-

esting manner & tried to instill into their minds to 

be prepared to harken to the word of the Lord & 

obey his commandments & obey the things that 

the prophet tells us to do & was followed by 

Elders H C Kimball & G. A. Smith who bore testimony 

of the work of God I spent the night at Br 

James McDaniel's. 

Pittsburgh resembles the 

English cities in consequence of their burning so 

much stone cole which covers the cities with 

smoke soot & blackness. Its Population is 35,000

it has 120 preachers of the Gospel, 95 churches 

& 21 Denominations, & It contains a Church 

of Latter Day Saints Numbering 75





July 29, 1843 ~ Saturday





29th I spent the Day at Br McDaniels McDowell writing 

& reading. We met in the evening at Br 

Savorys to teach the Elders. Elder B Young 

first addressed the meeting [FIGURE] The following 

are some of the principles taught the Elders 

By Elders Young. He says relative to government 

that a man should in the first place presidie 

over himself, his passions, his person, bring himself 

into subjection to the Law of God, then Preside



 END_ENTRY over his children & his wife in wrighteousnes

then he will be capable of Presiding over a 

branch of the Church but many Elders are 

contending about presiding over Churches when 

they are not capable of presiding over themselve

or the least child I have they have. 

Again the first Principle of our cause & work is to 

understand that their is a prophet in the Church 

& that he is at the head of the Church on Earth. who 

called Joseph Smith to be a prophet? Did the people 

or God. God & not the people called him, had the 

people gatherd together & appointed one of their 

number to be a Prophet he would have been 

accountable to the people but inasmuch as he 

was called of God & not the people he is accountab[le] 

to God & the Angel that committed the Gospel 

to him & not to any man on earth. The Twelve 

are accountable to the Prophet & his council 

& not to the Church for the course they persue 

& we have learned to go & do as the Prophet 

tells us to do





July 30, 1843 ~ Sunday





30th Sunday six of the quorum of the Twelve 

met at Temperance Hall in Pittsburgh 

with the Saints. Elder G. A. Smith opened the 

meeting by prayer Elder W. Woodruff 

addressed the people bore testimony of the work 

& spoke the things that were given by the 

Spirit of God, among other things said that 

the Church of God was organized with 

Prophets & Apostles, but what is the use of 

Prophets & Apostles if their is not to be revelations 

given & work for the apostles to do they certainly 

are not needed, if the work of Prophets &

Apostles are not to be received, but the vary Idie 

of those offices exhisteding is a proof of Revelation & gifts &c



 END_ENTRY the gospel & knowing the signs do follow, 

then I ask does these things harm any one, No 

they do not. In speaking of the kingdom of 

God, he said the kingdom must be together 

the people must be together & gatherd into 

one place. For how would the king of france 

or England look undertaking to reign over a 

kingdom when the people were scatterd all 

over the world except in france or England 

they could not reign over a people unless a people 

were with those kings to reign over, so with the 

saints they must be gatherd together & this work has 

already commenced, & who is the Author of this 

work & gathering, Josephs Smith the Prophet of 

God as an instrument in the hands of God is the 

Author of it, he is the greatest man on earth

No other man of this age has power to 

assemble such a great people from all the Nations 

of the earth with all their varied dispositions 

as assimulate them & cement them together 

so that they will be subject to rule & order

this the Prophet is doing & what makes a 

great king President or man is to have a 

great People to rule over.





We had an 

interesting time through the day. After meetig 

closed I went home with Elder Charles Beck 

& spent the night





July 31, 1843 ~ Monday





31st Our Quorum assembled together & walked 

over Pittsburgh. We first visited Mr Curlings

Glass works & saw them to work through each 

branch of it we saw them make pressed stampd 

& ground or cut & plain tumblers & large 

jars &c. We next went onto the bluff above 

the City & had a view of the New Basin that



 END_ENTRY is to contain the water to be forced into it from 

the Alleghaney River to water the city from this 

place we had a fair view of the City below & it 

truly sends forth its colums of smoke & blackness that 

arises from the cole fires that propels the numer

ous engines as the main spring of all the founderies 

manufacturies & works of the valey of the city 

of Pittsburgh. We then desended the hill & visited 

the city water works or resurvoy. The building 

is 150 feet long 110 feet wide containing two 

engines of 200 horse power each to drive a force 

pump to force the water from the Alleganey River 

into the bason on the bluff to water the city as 

above spoken of the whole cost of this building 

resurvoy & bason, was $200,000. The building 

is after the Roman order. The whole Archatecture 

design, & making & finishing the building was 

executed by Elder Charles Beck a member of 

the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints

We visited Miltonbergers Iron works through each 

branch of it, we saw the keel laid for an Iron 

steem ship of war 140 foot keel. for Lake Erie

much damage was done houses unroofed, 

gutters filled with water, streams suddenly

number of persons were drowned &c &c





August 6, 1843 ~ Sunday





6th Sunday in the fore part of the day I attended 

meeting of the Millerites in company with Elder 

Young & others. Mr Litz preached from 

Jer 24 ch concerning the good & bad figs. is in speaking 

of the covenant made to Abraham in giving him the 

land of Canaan, he said it was not to seeds but seed 

which was Christ, so the land belong to Jesus Christ 

& not the Jews but Jesus Christ had rented it to the 

Jews at 6 per cent or for evry 10th & the ownly 

terms on which it was given to the Jews, & that 

they were robing God all the while, will a man 

rob God &c & the Land was taken away from 

the Jews & who shall have the land not 

the Jews the natural seed. But those that are 

Baptised into Jesus Christ & his spiritual children,

the kingdom was to be taken from the Jews & 

given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits there 

of which will take place when Christ come 

with his Church & body & will then take 

Jerrusalem. -[Why did he not say that it has already 

been given to the gentiles & they have also fallen away]-



 END_ENTRY The Jews as a nation will not go to the land 

of Jerrusalem & when Jesus Christ comes the 

Jews will No more be his people. I will admit 

that the Jews will go with the other Nations 

against Jerrusalem to battle against the Lord 

& his Saints & fight against Jerrusalem & 

the Lord shall go forth & fight against the 

Nations & the Jews among the rest & that the 

Jews will fight agains Jerrusalem if the Jews 

ever go to Jerrusalem they will not go as Jews 

but all Christians as Christ body &c &c





The above was the arguments presented by 

the milerite to do away with the literal fulfill-

ment of the Bible concerning the return of 

the Jews & the rebuilding of Jerrusalem. 

But most of his arguments were fals & 

groundless





In the afternoon we met with the Saints 

In the Canaanite Church in Julia Ann St

about 300 Saints were present, meeting 

was opened by Elder Grant & Elder B. Young 

addressed the congregation to considerable 

length & laid a good foundation among other 

things said, that a man or woman may ask 

of God & get a witness & testimony from God 

concerning any work or messenger that is sent 

unto them. But if a person asks for a thing that 

does not concern him, such as governing the 

Church what shall the prophet or the Twelve 

do &c he will not get an answer if he does it 

will not be from God.



 

He also remarked in 

conversation or inquired who had the Melchezedek 

priesthood that if any in the Church had it he did not 

know it For any person to have the fulness of that



 END_ENTRY priesthood must be a king & a Priest a 

person may have a portion of that Priesthood the 

same as Governors or Judges of England have 

power from the King to transact business but 

yet he is not the king of England. A person may 

be anointed king & priest before they receive 

their kingdom &c. At the close of the meeting 

I dim returned to Br Hammers & in the evening 

Elder O. Pratt Preached & was followd 

by few remarks from Elder G A Smith

August 8, 1843 ~ Tuesday





8th In company with the Twelve and about 

150 Saints we left the city on board of a 

steemer for an excursion. As we glided over 

the water we passed the New frigate Rariton 

of sixty four guns which had been lanched but

& spent the day in the following amusment drinkig 

Ice water Lemonaid, & feasting, sailing, fishing, 

swinging, walking singing, & discussing vario

us subjects &c. The following subject arose 

for discussion is the Prosperity of any religious 

denomination a posative evidence that they



 END_ENTRY are right. Elder J. E. Page contended for the 

affirmative & Elder J M Grant for the negative 

after which the Chairman arose & said that 

Prosperity of any people was no positive evidence 

of their being right & decided accordingly which 

was Elder B Young. After taking our suppers 

we returned to the boat & crossed again to

 END_ENTRY The following was composed by Elder Lorenzo 

Barnes, which I took from an Album at the 

house of Mr Mosleys Centerville New Castle Co Del





Virtue





Virtue, O virtue thou Jem from Above

More charming than beauty more endearing than love

More Precious than Jewels and jems of the earth

Or titles of honour decending by birth





Behold the bright rainbow that circles the skye

While bending to earth with its bow far on high

Its colors of beauty with rapture behold

In order and splendor enchanting unfold





But what are the colors that are to be seen

In the bow of the cloud of red blue and green

Compared with those colors which virtue combine

Those heaven born treasures displayed in the mind





The bow of the cloud's soon faded and gone

Its painted on rain and receds with the storm

But Virtue a Princes in glory arayed

Which time cannot Varnish nor eternity fade





Virtues dominion is not among clouds

Nor oft is she seen mid the gay and the proud

Her throne is her purity her kingdom in mind

With modesty Prudence and meekness combined





Thus Elvira let virtue be ever your aim

Its light and its glory emblazen your name

Then charmes o'er your Temples forever shall bloom

They'll flourish through time and revive o'er the tomb





Lorenzo D. Barnes



 END_ENTRY August 20, 1843 ~ Sunday





Aug 20

20th Sunday [FIGURE] I wrote a letter to Elder M. Holmes 

Before meeting we assembled at the grove at 

the time appointed & a good congregation came 

together I addressed them in the fore part of the day 

from the following words "If our gospel be hid it 

be hid from them that are lost &c I felt much of 

the Spirit of testimony & felt that there were 

many hearts to receive, at the close of the meet-

ing the people flocked around the stand to obtain 

our Fac similee's of the plates and books &c they 

bought $4.75 worth of them. We dined at 

Br Harts during intermission we lade hands upon 

Br Malin the Presiding Elder & several other Elders

In the afternoon the congregation again assembled 

& was addressed by Elder O Pratt he spoke in 

much of the power & demonstration of the spirit of 

God from Rev 22 ch first clause of the 3rd vers and 

there shall be no more curse He commenced with the 

fall the curse that came on the earth & continued the 

subject untill the end & every curse was taken off traced 

the subject through the Millinnium second advent of 

Christ, the binding of Satan, peace for one thousand 

years the numerous increase of the inhabitants of the 

earth, & the letting loose of Satan, his going up with 

the hosts of the earth that he had deceived & compassing 

the Camp of the Saints & the Beloved City & fire came 

down from Heaven & devoured them. A great white 

throne appeared, the Saints & cities were cought up 

to God, the Heavens & earth passed away & the Lord 

made a new heavens & new earth the Saints cities & 

new Jerrusalem &c came down from God out of 

heaven & rested upon the new earth & the last enemy 

destroyed was death then Jesus Christ deliverd it up 

to his father as pure &c



 END_ENTRY the nation will now be deprived of the benefit of that 

wisdom and intelligence which the Prophet seer & 

revelator would have brought to light that would

have been used for the benefit of the nations, 

But now their die is cast and doom is sealed, & 

their judgment will come in an hour they are not 

aware of. It was so with the Jews, they said if 

we let Jesus alone he will come and take away 

our state and Nation so they crusifyed his 

shed his blood and said let it be upon us and our 

Children. And the judgments came upon them

their city was laid in the dust, & the inhabitants fell

by the sword & famine and the remnant was 

scattered throughout the gentile world, while if 

they had recieved Jesus Christ he would oft 

had gatherd together the people & saved the city. 

When the nations of the earth send their messeng

ers or ministers to any people & they are not recieved but 

^wel^ intreatly and killed treated lightly and killed will not 

that nation take vengance on their enemies is God

then of less consequence than man, when he sends 

his Prophets, messengers & servants to the world with 

a message & the people cast them out stone shoot 

and kill them, will not God take vengance on that

nation yea he ever did and ever will, and this nation

will not escape. John said in pouring out the plagues

upon the earth 16 ch 3 v. that he poured out his vial upon 

the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and 

evry living soul died in the sea, and the third angel 

poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountain of 

waters and they became blood. And the Angel said 

the Lord was righteous in so doing for they have shed 

the blood of Saints and Prophets and thou hast given them 

blood to drink for they are worthy 6 v. Some yay it 

was in the days of Jesus Christ, But it was not in the 

days of Jesus Christ for John lived after and saw 

things in the last days. It seems that the waters 

was turned to blood because they had shed the



 END_ENTRY Blood of Prophets and Saints. Their was to be 

two Prophets in Jerrusalem slain, for they tormented 

them. Prophets are always a torment to the People

for they tell them the truth, reprove their transgressions

speak of the Judgments that are to come, when those 

prophets were to be slain the people all would rejoice 

& send Presents to one another because the prophets who 

had tormented them were slain, but in three days 

they stood upon their feet & the Joy of their enemies 

was of short duration. It is so now their is a secret 

Joy in the hearts of the Priest and many people 

that the Prophet and Patriarch is murdered and 

some manifest their joy openly. It is always a 

dark time Just before day, it is a dark time now

but it will soon be light. When Christ was crucifyed 

it was a dark time they were ready to go to their farm 

fishing and merchandize and Peter sent to inquire if 

he was the one or if we should look for another, the 

answer was go and tell them what you see and 

hear, feel my body I have arisen and Joy immediatly 

arose in their bosom. As soon as the Jews found he 

had arisin they bribed the guard to say that while they 

were asleep his deciples stole him away, which saying 

is believed among the Jews untill the present day

and they are taken in their own snare for it has been 

that vary key that has chained them untill the present 

time, & so it is with this nation they have sealed their 

damnation by shedding the blood of the vary man that 

holds the keys of this last dispensation and consequently 

their destiny. A word about Br Joseph being killed

some have thought he could not be killed, but the Lord 

never said so neither did Joseph say so. So did 

Peter say to Jesus when he told him that he would be slain 

or offered, far be it from thee this shall not come upon 

thee Jesus said get the[e] behind me Satan thou savoreth not 

the things that be of God but of men.



 END_ENTRY In the first instance The Prophet crossed the river 

to Iowa & while there he inquired of the Lord what he  

should do and the Lord told him to return and give 

himself up he appeared to be aware that he would be

slain. The covenants convey this ^same^ idea ^concerning Joseph^ see Page 159 4 par

Behold I grant unto you eternal life if you should be slain

Page 126, 1 & 2 Par. It is supposed by some that the Govornor 

had a hand in this affair, at first they were not ready to 

recieve him for the plan was not finished how to dispose 

of him. The Govornor had taken away all of the state 

arms, & was in Nauvoo requesting them to give up 

their private arms at the same time that they were murder-

ing our brethren at Carthage Jeal. as soon as the word came 

the govornor fled, the women and children removed

so as to come stir up the world to come and destroy the

place but this failed. In consequence of the death 

of the prophets the Editors seem to get the spirit of prophecy

and say the work is done & will stop, and die. But as I 

am in the midst of the Prophetic Editors like Saul I 

ketch some of the spirit of Prophecy & so I will prophe[s]y 

that instead of the work diying it will be like the mustard 

stock that was ripe that a man undertook to throw out 

of his garding and scattered seed all over it and next 

year it was nothing but mustard. It will be so by 

shedding the blood of the prophets it will make 10 Saints 

whare their is one now. Some said that he would 

be President, but is now dead, now what will he do

the Revelator says He that overcometh will I give 

Power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a 

rod of Iron. I dont know but he may hold the keys 

of the Plagues that are to be poured out in the last 

days upon this and other nations. Angels appeared 

anciently to John, who were his fellow servants the

prophets Joseph may appear in this day to his brethren

This gospel of the kingdom must be preached in all the world 

for a testimony then shall the end come though they should



 END_ENTRY be persecuted if they endured to the end they should

be saved. This generation speak much about the clouds 

and weather they disern the face of the sky but why 

can they not disern the signs of the times. The fig trees 

are leaving and all things indicate the second advent

of Christ.



 

Elder B Young arose and said he felt disposed to add

his testimony, be of good cheer, the testiment is not 

in force while the Testator liveth when he died it was 

in force so it is with Joseph, on the day of Pentecost 

their was but 120 of the Saints, but at that time 

their were added 3000 souls. when God sends a 

man to do a work all the devils in hell cannot kill him 

untill he gets through his work. So with Joseph He 

prepared all things gave the keys to men on the earth

and said I may be soon taken from you.



 

I recieved an extra Nauvoo Neighbor during the evening 

which gave an account of the death of ^the^ Prophet & Patriarch 

at the close of the meeting I went home and spent

23rd Tuesday I took the parting hand with father and 

mother with great satisfaction a peculier charm was 

thrown around my soul as I left the threshhold of 

my fathers house, having the confidence that if I 

never see my father in the flesh again I shall meet 

him again ^in^ the first resurrection. I had a desire in

my heart that all the ordinances of the fulness 

of the gospel might also be administered unto father

Aug 5th Monday this is the day of election in this

state their will probably be some fighting and perhaps

some blood shed as men are geting wicked and 

about ripe for judgement, their was some fighting

in the bar room below last evening but nothing 

vary serious. Elder Kimball had a dream last evening

thought he was preaching to a large congregation

said the Prophet Joseph Smith had laid the foundation

for a great work and it was now for us to build

upon it. He thought Br Joseph was present and appeared 

natural. We took the steemer St Croix and 

left Galena for Nauvoo we had a plesant sail

unplesant feelings during the evening.





August 6, 1844 ~ Tuesday

which we prepared our minds to once 

more behold the city of Nauvoo & embrace our 

families ^& friends^ we arived in the city of Nauvoo at 

8 oclock in the evening at the upper stone house

we were hailed with Joy by all the Citizens

we met. I accompanied the quorum of the

Twelve to their families after which I was 

conveyed to my own and truly felt to rejoice to once 

^more^ embrace my wife and children. I spent the night

at home with my family, thus it is with me. I have 

not spent but one summer either at home or with 

the church, for the last 10 years as my lot has been

all the day long in the vineyard. I go and come from 

year to year distance from Galenia to Nauvoo 250 m

when we landed in the city there was a deep gloom

seemed to rest over the city of Nauvoo which we never

experienced before



 END_ENTRY August 7, 1844 ~ Wednesday





Aug 7th 1844, I went forth this morning through 

the city of Nauvoo saw many friends & met with

the quorum of the twelve at Elder Taylors

we were truly glad to see each other Br Taylor 

was getting well of his wounds, that he recieved 

in Jail in company with Joseph and Hiram Smith 

when they were murdered, we were glad to 

see Dr Richards who escaped unhurt, we were

recived with gladness by the Saints throughout the 

city they felt like sheep without a shepherd, as being 

without a father, as their head had been taken 

away. We spent the fore part of the day at

Br Taylors, and in the afternoon, we met in Council

at the Seventies Hall. viz the Twelve, High Council, and 

High Priest &c & we herd Sidney Rigdon tell his 

story and message which he had to us and the Church

a long story it was a kind of second class vision

he said he was appointed to come and offer 

himself to lead the Church, and many things 

was said. He was followed by Br Brigham 

Young and he showed that their could not be 

any one before the Twelve. A conference was 

appointed for the whole Church to come together 

on Tuesday next at 10 oclok.





August 8, 1844 ~ Thursday





8th Their was a meeting appointed at the

grove for the church to come together for prayer

But in consequence of some excitement among the 

People and a dispositions by some spirits to try to divide 

the church, it was thought best to attend to the 

business of the church in the afternoon that was

to be attended to on Tuesday, the Twelve

spent their time in the fore part of the day at the 

office and in the afternoon met at the grove the

following is the business of the day.



 END_ENTRY Aug 8th 1844

[FIGURE] All the authorities of the Church of 

Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in and 

about Nauvoo met in a special conference 

in the grove in Nauvoo at 3 oclock. The quorum of 

the Twelve, Councillors S. Rigdon & A Lyman, the 

High Council, and others occupied the Stand, the 

High Priest, quorum, & quorum of the Seventies and 

Elders, Pishops Priests Teachers & deacons appeared 

in their several quorums and took their seats and 

also a vast congregation of Saints, when all was 

seated that could get seats,

President B. Young arose and said Attention all 

this congregation makes me think of the days of 

king Benjamin when the People was so great that 

they could not make them hear, But we want 

your attention. Wm W Phelps was called 

upon to address the throne of grace which he did do 

most fervently. President B Young again 

arose and said let none complain because of the 

situation of the congregation. we have all done the best 

we could.



 

For the first time in my life, for the first time in 

your lives, for the first time in the kingdom of God

do I step forth to act in my capacity in connexion 

with the quorum of the Twelve as Apostles of Jesus 

Christ unto the People and to bear of the keys of the

Kingdom of God in all the world. And for the first time

are you called to walk by faith not by sight, for 

always before you have had a Prophet as the mouth 

of the Lord to speak to you. but he has sealed his 

testimony with his Blood. I now want to ask 

each of you to tell me if you want to chuse a



 END_ENTRY gardeen [guardian], a Prophet, evangelist or sumthing els

as your head to lead you all that are in favor of it 

make it manifest by raising the right hand. No hands 

raised. All that wants to draw away a party from 

the church after them let them do it if they can

but they will not prosper. I now wish to speak of 

the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of 

Latter Day Saints; Sidney Rigdon and Amasa Lyman

were counsellors to Joseph. I ask whare is Joseph

he is gone beyound the vail, and for them to act in 

their office as his cooncillors they must go beyond 

the veil whare he is. Their has been much said abou[t] 

Presiden Rigdon being president of the Church 

leading the People, being the head, &c If the People

want President Rigdon to lead them, they may 

have him. But I say unto you that the quorum 

of The Twelve have the keys of the kingdom 

of God in all the world, they stand next to Joseph 

and are the Presidency of the Church, and hold 

the keys and would have to ordain any man unto 

that appointment if one that should be chosen ie if one 

was to be chosen. You cannot appoint any man at

our head. we should have to ordain him, you cannot 

appoint a man at our head, But if you want any 

other man to lead you, take him, and we will go 

our way to build up the kingdom in all the world. 

Perhaps some think that president Rigdon would 

not be honored But if he does right he will not act 

against our council nor we against his but act together

but I repeat again No man can stand at our head. 

The Prophet Joseph has lade the foundation for 

a great work, and we will build upon it. Do you 

want a Patriarch for the whole church it would 

have been the right of Samuel Smith if he had 

lived, but he is dead William is left and John

Smith it is their right. Do you want a trustee



 END_ENTRY in trust if so look at a bishop, it is their place 

to attend to temporal matters they never yet have 

acted in their station. Elder S. Rigdon 

claims to be a spokesman to Joseph, vary well he 

is but can he now act in that office if he wants 

now to be a spokesman to the prophet, he must go 

to the other side of the veil for the Prophet is there

But Elder Rigdon is here. why will Elder Rigdon 

be a fool. Let those who holds the keys of the 

kingdom of God build it up in all the world. If their 

is a spokesman if he is a king and Priest let him go 

and build up a kingdom this is his right, and it is 

the right of many here but who is the head? 

the Twelve. if one Thousand rise up and say they 

have the Prophets Joseph shoes I know they are impost-

ures If you know how the church is organized I 

wish to ask a question. Now If you want Rigdon 

Lyman or Law to lead you or any body els, you may 

have them, But I tel you in the name of the 

Lord, that no man can put another betwen 

the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph, why

because Joseph was their file leader and he has 

committed into there hands the keys of the 

kingdom for all the world. dont put a thread 

between the Priesthood and God I will ask who 

has stood next to Joseph and Hiram. I have and 

I will stand next to him. we have a head, and

that head is the Twelve and we can now begin to 

see the neccessity of the Apostleship I will now 

close and give way for my brethren.





Elder A Lyman arose and said, I will say a few 

words. I am satisfyed with the open frank manner 

that Elder Young has addressed this assembly. 

I ownly take exceptions to my name being associated 

with Wm Law. Elder Young asks Pardon it



 END_ENTRY is granted. I believe their is no power or, officer 

or means wanted to carry on the work but what 

is in the Twelve, the right has been presented 

by Elder Young and I will back him up. President 

Young has stood next to the Prophet Joseph 

with the Twelve and I have stood next to them 

and I will still stand next to them. We have 

a head here what is that head[?] the quorum

of the Twelve we now se the necessity of 

the Apostleship. I might rise up as well as any 

other man to ask for the head but I could not 

do it without endangering my salvation. But 

I will stand unto the Twelve the same as I did 

to Joseph either on one side or the other 

but not before them. President Rigdon 

called upon W. W. Phelps to speak in his 

behalf as he could not speak.





Phelps arose and said, he believed their 

had been enough said to Prepare the minds 

of the People to act. I have seen the people 

submit with defference to the authority of the

church. I have seen the People take their

lives in their hand and gather subjects for the 

kingdom of God. I have seen them prepare 

for war and ready to pour out their hearts 

Blood, and I am happy to see the same 

disposition manifest here today as was when 

Joseph and Hiram Smith was brought dead 

murdered to this city, then you submitted 

to the Law and to God and I see the same 

thing today you are ready to submit to the

authority of God the Twelve are chosen 

to rise up and bear the Church off triumphant

I ^have^ feelings about this esspecially for president 

Rigdon their is a quorum that the 12 belong to

Br Rigdon was brought to the same quorum



 END_ENTRY and received in part the blessings. Joseph 

has gone but he has not left us comfortless, for 

he will administer unto us I will bear this testimony

in 2 nights after he was slain he came to me (and

I thought their was a large building stood on 

wheels, and he said tell the drivers to drive on I 

asked if the building was on wheels[.] yes so 

we drove all round the hills and valleys and 

finally over the river into Iowa. I told him 

Devil Creek was before us I dont care said he for 

Devil Creek drive over it and we did so) 

their is a combination in Nauvoo to stand for ^destroy^ 

all that stand for Joseph, but 

let us go ahead and build up the Temple and 

you will then be endowed. If you want to 

do right uphold the Twelve. If they die I am

willing to die with them. But do your duty 

and you will be endowed, I will sustain the 

Twelve. Joseph and Hiram are removed 

whare they can convers with the Gods beyound 

the reach of Powder and ball.





P. P. Pratt arose and said if their was wicked

men in this city that was so bad it was because 

we supported them. Stop dealing with them 

and they will go away[.] will I support them

No. I am willing to do good to all men esspecially to 

the household of faith, except mobs and wicked men

will scease when you scease to support them

I would rather die a natural death than to employ 

a wicked doctor to kill me



 

President Young arose and said their is more

business than we can do this afternoon but we 

can place ourselves in a situation to continue



 END_ENTRY the business without calling the whold Church

I dont want you to abide my council alone 

but act for yourselves. If you want Sidney Rigdon 

to lead you vote for him but if you dont intend 

to follow him, and support him as you did Joseph

and I would say the same for the Twelve 

dont make a covenant to support them unless 

you intend to abide by their council. But we 

want to know if this people will support the Priesthood

If you build the house you will get the endowm-

ent. If we do our best and cannot build the 

house we will go into the wilderness and get 

it. will you take our council. The first is 

do you want President Rigdon to be the head 

or do the Saints want the Twelve to Stand as 

the head. the first Presidency of the church 

and at the head of this Kingdom in all the 

world, stand next to Joseph, walk up into 

their calling, hold the Keys of this Kingdom

All that are in favor of this in all the congre-

gation of the Saints manifest it by holding 

up the right hand. Their was sea of hands 

a universal vote, a contrary vote was called 

and not a hand was raised in all the con-

gregation. Let President Rigdon go and raise 

up a mighty kingdom. Our feelings are to let 

Marsh stand as the President of this stake. 

Joseph has loved this People unto death and 

Hiram has loved Joseph and this People unto 

death. If the The Twelve had been here 

I would not have seen him given up, he should 

not have been given up. He was in your 

midst But you did not know him he has been 

taken away for the People are not worthy 

of him. But let not men think that the kingdom 

of God, is rent from you it is not, if we were all



 END_ENTRY dead the High Priest would rise up and with 

the keys of the Kingdom build up the kingdom

let men go to a healthy country and get a foot

hold, so as to be sustained in the midst of our

persecution. The Saints will still be tithed 

untill the temple is done all that is in favor

of being tithed untill the temple is finished 

make it manifest with the usual sign it was 

a universal vote. Would it be the feelings 

of the people to support the Twelve in all the 

world in their missions. It was a universal vote 

Will the Twelve People let the Twelve regu-

lated the financial concerns of the Church

A universal vote





The Patriarchal Priesthood belongs to the 

Smith family, if Samuel had lived it would

have been his right, but as it is will the people

leave the matter the Twelve, it was 

A universal vote.





Do you want to sustain President Rigdon to stand

in his place to council with us, and we with him 

and the same Br A Lyman A universal vote

Resolved that the Twelve dictate the affairs of 

the Temple committies and other affairs

 END_ENTRY Elder Brigham Young house for meeting. President Hiram Smith opened the meeting by prayer after

which the Presidency lade their hands upon my head & sealed a blessing upon me President Rigdon being

speaker they also sealed a blessing upon the head of Elders George A Smith & Turley. Also upon the head

of Sister Young sister Tailor & my wife. If we were faithful we had the promise of again returning to the

bosom of our families & being blesed on our mission & having many souls as seals of our ministry. After

the blessings were bestowed Brother Hiram Smith arose & gave The Twelve some interesting advice

and council considering it best to say nothing but repentance to this generation or at least to preach the first

principles of the gosepl as that was as much as this generation could endure & many other things he said of

interest. Then Joseph arose & presented some precious things of the kingdom unto us in the power of the

Holy Ghost, yea precious principles that ought to be engraven upon our hearts & practiced in our lives, some of which

are as follows. Ever keep in exercise the principles of mercy & be ready to forgive our brother on the first

intimations of repentance & asking forgiveness & should we even forgive our brother or our enemy before

they ask it our heavenly father would be equally as merciful unto us, & also we ought to be willing to

repent of & confess all of our own sins & keep nothing back, & let the Twelve be humble & not be exalted

& beware of pride & not seek to excell one above another but act for each others good & honerably make

mention of each others name in our prayrs before the Lord & before our fellow men, & not backbite & devour

our brother. Why will not man learn wisdom by precept & example at this late age of the world & not be

oblieged to learn every thing we know by sad experiance. Must the new ones that are chosen to fill the

places of those that are fallen of the quorum of the Twelve, begin to exhalt themselves untill they get so high

that they will tumble over & have a great fall & go wallowing through the mud, mire, & darkness Judas

like to the buffatings of Satan as several of the Twelve have done, or will they learn wisdom & be wise. (O

God give them wisdom & keep them humble I pray). When the Twelve or any other witness of Jesus Christ

stands befor the congregations of the earth & they preach in the power & demonstration of the Holy Ghost &

the people are asstonished & confounded at the doctrin & say that that man has preached a powerful discours

a great sermon then let that man or those men take care that they do not asscribe the glory unto themselves

but be careful that they are humble & asscribe the praise & glory to God & the Lamb for it is by the power of the



 END_ENTRY Holy Priesthood & the Holy Ghost that they have power thus to speak. What art thou O man but dust & from

wholm dost thou received thy power & blessings but from God, then O ye Twelve notice this [FIGURE] key & be wise

for Christ sake & your own souls sake. Ye are not sent out to be taught but to teach let every man be sober

be vigilent & let all his words be seasoned with grace & keep in mind that it is a day of warning & not of many

words. Act honest before God & man beware of gentile sophestry such as bowing & scraping unto men in wholm

you have no confidence. be honest open & frank in all your intercourse with mankind

O ye Twelve and all saints, profit by this important key [FIGURE] that in all your trials, troubles, &

temptations, afflictions bonds imprisionment & death see to it that you do not betray heaven, that

you do not betray Jesus Christ, that you do not betray your Brethren, & that you do not betray the revela

tions of God whether in the bible, Book of Mormon, or Doctrine & Covenants or any of the word of God.

yea in all your kicking, & floundering see to it that you do not this thing lest innocent blood be found

in your skirts & you go down to hell. We may ever know by this sign that there is danger of our

being led to a fall & aposticy, when we give way to the devil so as to neglect the first known duty

but whatever you do do not betray your Friend

July 7, 1839 ~ Sunday





7th Sunday this is an important day & worthy of record because of the important scenes

which transpir'd as follows. I crossed the Missisippi river in the ferry boat with Mrs Woodruff

in company with two of the Twelve & about one hundred saints which went to Commerce

from Montrose to attend a meeting that the Twelve might deliver their farewell address before they

left for England. when we arived at the place of meeting Elder John E. Page was speaking he occupied

the stand in the forepart of the day & spoke much upon the proof of the book of Mormon in the

afternoon brother John Taylor spoke & bore testimony also of the things of God. I followed



 END_ENTRY him in testimony & rejoiced in having the privilege of once more addressing the body of the church

Brother Orson Hide followed me & he had the spirit of the Lord. Brother Brigham Young next

spoke & also bore testimony in the spirit. We was then addressed by President S. Rigdon & his

address was peculiarly adapted to the circumstances of the Twelve taking their leave of all

they hold dear on earth & go forth from their own nation & stand before the kings & rulers of the natio-

ns of the earth to bear testimony unto them of the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus

Christ his address was of such a nature in appealing to our affections, in parting with our wives, and

children, & the peculiarity of our mission, the perils that we might meet with, & the blessings that

we should receive, &c. that tears was brought from many eyes. Joseph addressed us in few

words & says remember brethren that if you are imprisioned Brother Joseph has been imprisoned

before you, if you are placed whare you can ownly see your Brethren through the grates

of a window while in Irons because of the gospel of Jesus Christ remember Brother Joseph

has been in like circumstances also after other similar remarks the meeting closed & three

persons were Baptized & confirmed which ended the duties of the day.





REFLECTIONS Surely this is an important day to behold a quorum of Twelve Apostles of the

Lamb of God organized in these last days to go forth unto all the nations of the earth to prune

the vineyard once more for the last time that the saints may be prepared for the second [coming]

of Christ, & that Israel may be gathered & babylon fall & the earth once more clensed from

its pollutions & wickedness swept from the face thereof [FIGURE] May the Lord enable us the

Twelve ever to be meek & humble & to lie passive in this hands as the clay is in the hands of the potter

& may we ever realize that while we are in the service of God & doing his will, that though we

may be surrounds by mobs & threatened with death that the Lord is our deliverer & that he will

support us in every time of trouble & trial

called upon to visit the sick & administer unto them by the laying on of hands. We found quite a

number that were sick several received a blessings & while administering in spiritual things

of PARLEY P. PRATT from Prision whare he had been confined seven

months for the cause of God. Brother Morris Phelps was also delivered with Parley. they

by Orson Pratt, Sister Phelps & others. they were closely persued by the mob & narrowly escaped

by leaving behind them their horses saddles bridles & hats & arived in Quincy on the 10th of July

making six days on the road. they are now all liberated but two persons viz King Follet &

fatigued & had a fever. I had an interview during the evening with a Mr Adams that

had been a constant companion of Br Asahels for several years & appeared to be the most

capable of giving me a correct account concerning him in evry point of view, of any

man in the West. [written sideways in left margin]^ASAHEL H. WOODRUFF^  He informed me that in the main point he was vary steady & temporate

in his habits, & did not believe in the principle of white lying or misrepresenting in order to

carry on his business or merchantdize, he got along well in his business untill the last year of his

life, he had bought a large quantity of Books & they did not sell as well as he expected & he was

not able to meet all of his payments, this was a source of much regret to him & the main cause 

of his esstate being insolvent. During the last year of his life he manifested a desire to more

fully improve his mind than he ever had done. he read many of Thomas Paine's writing & they

more fully esstablished him in the gospel of Jesus Christ although Pains writing were against

the gospel. Asahel considered his writings eisily to be refuted. Asahel was more free to open

his mind to Mr Adams than any other man consequently he was more capable of Judging of

his views & feelings upon spiritual subjects he informed me that his mind was deeply ingaged 

in the subject of the faith of the latter Day Saints. At first he said but little about it but before his



 END_ENTRY death he warmly contended for the principles & defended the cause of the Latter Day Saints when

it was assailed. Asahel (in one sens of the word) was not himself but another man during the last four

months of his life he was abent minded & overwhelmed in deep study & thought for hours together

at times he would ride half a day beside Mr Adams & not utter a word, & at other times he would

speak to him two or three times before he would notice him or speak to him. he lost his former

cheerfulness & during those four months he more freequently spoke of his friends & relatives

than before esspecially myself & most of father's family. he was making preperation to go east &

was ownly hendered by his sickness & death. He freequently spoke of Death & of the uncertainty

of life. he was teacher in the Sunday School in the Presbyterian Church for a length of time

in Terr Haute though not a member of the church. by any means. He had freequently argured against

against the principles of Dancing schools, but got to attend a part of a quarter during this peculiar

state of mind and also some parties. But Mr Adams thought he would not have done it if he had

been perfectly himself. Mr Adams was absent from Terre Haute During Asahels sickness

and Death selling books for him. Asahel wrote him two letters and Mr Adams judjing

from the contents of these letters that he was evidently growing worse, immediately returned 

to Terre Haute & on his arival found that Asahel Hart Woodruff one of his most intimate &

best friends on earth was dead & buried. He immediately inquired into his sickness & death and

he thinks he would have been more comfortable if he could have been in a private family

& been kept from exposing himself to cold and damp air as he was in some degree while

under the operation of medicine. Mr Adams also confirmed the statement that his loss

was deeply felt in the west by all of his acquaintance & that those peculiar traits which

Asahel possessed that interested so many in the east had the same effect in the west. Asahel maintained

that the cause of the Latter Day Saints was worthy of a thorough investigation & ought to be carefully

searched into. Mr Adams was in Asahels employ untill his death & at the administrators sale he purchased

$1000 dollars worth of his books, & is now supplying Asahels former customers. Mr Adams gave me

between life & death I felt some of the time 

like gathering up my feet & sleeping with my fathers END_ENTRY August 10, 1842 ~ Wednesday to September 19, 1842 ~ Monday





I was confined to my Bed or house from the 

10th of Aug to the 19th of Sept making 40 days 

during my sickness the Twelve came & anointed 

me & lade hands upon me & rebuke my 

fever & I felt a testimony that I should recover 

after I began to recover I had a relaps twice which 

put me back much. In one instance I was 

requested to attend a Conference or Council of the 

quorum of the Twelve in the case of Orson Pratt 

I was weak & feeble yet I thought I would try to 

meet with them with the expectation that they 

would meet at Elder John Taylors who was 

also vary low with the Billious fever but on our 

arival at his house he was so vary feeble he was 

not able to have it there so it was remove to 

President Hyram Smiths Office Elder B. Young 

conveyed me in his carriag to the place of 

meeting but I had not been in the house more 

than 10 minutes before my strength began to 

fail me I lay down upon a bench but had no 

sooner lain down than I was gone my breath 

stoped, my Brethren raised me up took me to the 

door into the air & with the assistance of water 

air &c I was brought to breath again but not without 

a hard struggle between life & death the Breth-

ering lade hands upon me & Br Hyram Smith 

prayed for my recovery I soon began to breathe 

free but I was deprived of all my strength 

they convey me home, it being a warm time 

I was much troubled for breathing through most 

of the night & it took me several days to recover 

my former strength.



During my sickness there was some important 

things transpired in the Church we received 

the word of the Lord concerning the 

Elders of the Church (through Joseph the 

Seer) The Lord manifested that it was 

his will that the first presidency, the 

Twelve, The High Council The quorum 

of High Priest, and the Elders quorum 

as a general thing should go into 

the vineyard. The instructions were 

for the Elders to confine themselves to the END_ENTRY to the free States & mostly to New England 

& the Canidas not to go to any of the indians 

or Slave States. The result was that a 

special conference was called & three or 

four hundred Elders were called upon to 

go into the vineyard & about 400 Elders have 

since gone & many others are going their 

has never at any time been as great a 

turn out into the vineyard since the 

foundation of the Church, Br J. Taylor & my-

self are the ownly ones of the Twelve that 

have not gone out into the vineyard we being 

sick could not go besides it was thought 

wisdom for us to continue in the printing 

Business. There was a Counsel of the 

Twelve held for four days with Elder 

Orson Pratt to labour with him to 

get him to recall his sayings against Joseph 

& the The Twelve but he persisted in his 

wicked course & would not recall any of his 

sayings which were made in public against 

Joseph & others sayings which were unjust 

& untrue. The Twelve then rejected 

him as a member of their quorum & he 

was cut off ^from the Church^ Dr John Cook Bennet was 

the ruin of Orson Pratt, ^He was Cut off from 

the Church Aug 20, 1842^ President Joseph 

Smith has been much persecuted of late 

by being hunted & sought for by sheriffs 

& officers from Missouri & Illinoise 

by the orders of Governors Reynolds & 

Carlin under pretence of taking him to Missouri 

to try him for being accessary to the shoot in 

of ex Gov Bogg but it is no more or less than 

the spirit of persecution but though Joseph 

has been deprived of the privilege of appearing 

openly & deprived of the society of his own 

family Because sheriffs are hunting him to 

destroy him without cause. Yet the LORD is 

with ^him^ as he was upon the Isle of Patmos 

with John. Joseph has presented the Church 

of late with some glorious principles from the 

Lord concerning baptism for the dead END_ENTRY & other interesting subjects, he has appeared 

occasionally in the midst of the Saints which 

has been a great comfort to the Saints but 

I was deprived of attending s as I was confined 

with sickness.

[FIGURE] I wrote a letter to Br Webster in answer to one 

I received from him

an interview with Elders Young & Kimball 

who had returned home for a few days 

to get some printing done they were going 

out again in few days to hold conferences 

through this state, they had met in council 

with Joseph who thought it wisdom for 

Elder Taylor & myself to remain at home 

& attend to Printing. The Lord hath opened 

a door within a few days for puting the 

town of Keokirk into the hands of the Saints 

& Joseph's council was for me to go to keokirk 

& publish a political paper & Elder Taylor 

publish the Times & Seasons in Nauvoo so I 

am aranging the affairs of my family to 

do as the Lord may direct. In addition to 

my own &c sickness Mrs Woodruff has had 

a rising on both of her thumbs which appears END_ENTRY to be a species of the fellen which has caused her

Instructions delivered by Prest. Joseph Smith 

before the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo. Ap 28, 1842



Prest. J. Smith arose & called the attention of the meeting 

to the 12th Chap. 1st ##1 Corinthians 12|Corin##th "Now concerning spiritual gifts" &c, 

said that the passage which reads "no man can say Jesus is 

the christ but by the Holy Ghost", should be translated, no 

man can Know. &c, [##1 Corinthians 12:3##]



He contind. to read the chapter & give instructions re-

specting the different offices, & the necessity of every individu-

al acting in the sphere allotted him or her, & filling the several 

offices to which they were appointed - spoke of the disposition 

of men, to consider the lower offices in the church dishonorable 

& to look with jealous eyes upon the standing of others, that 

it was the nonsense of the human heart, for a person to be aspiring 

to other stations than appointed of God - that it was better 

for individuals to magnify their respective callings, & wait 

patiently till God shall say to them to come up higher. 

He said the reason of these remarks being made, was, that 

some little thing was circulating in the Society, that some 

persons were not going right in laying hands on the sick &c, 

said if he had common sympathies, would rejoice that the 

sick could be healed, that the time had not been before that 

these things could be in their proper order that the church 

is not now organized into its proper order, & cannot be until 

the temple is completed - - - Pres Smith continued the 

subject by adverting to the commision given to the ancient apos-

tles "Go ye into all the world &c" [##Mark 16:15##]- no matter who beleiveth; 

these signs, such as healing the sick, casting out devils &c, 

should follow all that beleive wether male or female. 

He asked the society if they could not see by this Sweeping 

stroke that wherein they are ordained it is the privilege 

of those set apart to administer in that authority which is 

conferred on them & if the sisters should have faith to 

heal the sick, let all hold their tongues, & let every thing 

roll on.



He said if God has appointed him, & chosen him as 

an instrument to lead the church, why not let him lead 

it through? Why stand in the way, when he is appointed to 

do a thing? Who knows the mind of God? Does he not END_ENTRY reveal things differently from what we expect? He remarked 

that he was continually rising - altho' he had every thing 

bearing him down, standing in his way & opposing - after all 

he always comes out right at the end.



Respecting females laying on hands, he further remarkd 

there could be no devil in it if God gave his sanction by healing 

that there could be no more sin in any female laying hands 

on the sick than in wetting the face with water that it 

is no sin for any body to do it that has faith, or if the sick 

has faith to be healed by the administration.



He reproved those that were disposed to find fault 

with the management of concerns - saying if he undertook to 

lead the church he would lead it right - that he calculates 

to organize the church in proper order &c.



Pres Smith continued by speaking of the difficulties 

he had to surmount ever since the commencement of the 

work in consequence of aspiring men, "great big Elders" as he 

called them, who had caused him much trouble, whom he 

had taught in the private council: & they would go forth into 

the world & proclaim the things he had taught them; as 

there own revelations - said the same aspiring disposition will 

be in this Society - & must be guarded against - that every 

person should stand & act in the place appointed, & thus 

sanctify the society & get it pure.



He said he had been trampled under foot by as-

piring Elders, for all were infected with that spirit, for 

instance P. Pratt, O. Pratt, O. Hyde & J. Page had been aspiring 

they could not be exalted but run away as tho' the care & 

authority of the church were vested with them - he said he 

had a subtile devil to deal with & could only curb him 

by being humble.



He said as he had this opportunity he was 

going to instruct the Society & point out the way for them 

to conduct, that they might act according to the will 

of God - that he did not know as he should have many 

opportunities of teaching them as they were going to be 

left to themselves, they would not long have him to 

instruct them, that the church would not have 

his instruction long, & the world would not be troubled 

with him a great while, & would not have his teaching. 

He spoke of delivering the Keys to this Society & the church 

that according to his prayers God had appointed him END_ENTRY elsewhere.



He exhorted the Sisters always to concentrate 

their faith and prayers for, & place confidence in those 

whom God has appointed to honor, whom God has 

placed at the head to lead that we should arm them 

with our prayers, that the keys of the Kingdom are 

about to be given to them that they may be able to de-

tect every thing false, as well as to the Elders.



He said if one member becomes corrupt & you 

know it; you must immediately put it away. The 

Sympathies of the heads of the church have induced them 

to bear with those that were corrupt; in consequence 

of which all become contaminated, you must put down 

iniquity & by your good example provoke the Elders 

to good works, if you do right no danger of going too fast: 

he said he did not care how fast we run in the path 

of virtue, resist evil & there is no danger, God, men, angels, 

& devils, cant condemn those that resist every thing 

that is evil - as well might the devil seek to disthrone 

Jehovah as that soul that resists every thing that 

is evil.



The charitable Society, this is according to your 

natures, it is natural for females to have feelings of charity 

you are now placed in a situation where you can act 

according to those sympathies which God has planted 

in your bosoms.



If you live up to these principles how great &

glorious! if you live up to your privilege, the angels 

cannot be restrained from being your associates - - 

females if they are pure & innocent can come into 

the presence of God, for what is more pleasing to God 

than innocence, you must be innocent or you can 

not come up before God, if we would come before 

God let us be pure ourselves. The devil has great 

power, he will so transform things as to make one 

gape at those who are doing the will of God. 

you need not be teasing men for their deeds, but 

let the weight of innocence be felt, which is more 

mighty than a mill stone hung about the neck. 

Not war, not jangle, not contradiction, but meek-

ness, love, purity, these are the things that should 

magnify us. - Achan must be brought [##Joshua 7:19-26##] END_ENTRY June 27, 1843 ~ Tuesday

said that President Joseph Smith would be 

in Nauvoo next day with Reynolds & Wilson who 

had taken him





June 30, 1843 ~ Friday





[FIGURE] June 30th 1843 Early in the morning I went 

to the court room assisted Dr Richards to 

arange the seats to prepare the room for 

the arival of Gen Smith & the company at 

about 1 oclock PM the citizens of Nauvoo 

went out on foot horsback & in many carriages 

to meet the Prophet viz Gen Smith & when they 

did meet their was a seen of Great Joy & with a 

band of music & a great multitude they followed 

him to his own house, & Reynolds of Missouri 

& Wilson of Carthage who had illegally taken 

Joseph Smith at the force of arms looked 

as though they had had the ague they had 

treated Joseph Smith shamfully deprived 

him of the wright of Hebeas Corpus & of speaking 

to any friend & intended to run him in to Missouri 

as soon as possible. But the Lord raised him



 END_ENTRY up friends & deliverd him from their hands 

or in other words brought them all together to 

Nauvloo Nauvoo & it was truly a regoiceing 

time to the Saints to see him again Reynolds & 

Wilson were both taken with a writ for 

fals imprisionment though their intention 

was to have taken Joseph Smith's life by taken 

him to Missouri to be destroyed yet Joseph 

Smith heaped cowles of fire upon their head 

by treating them well setting them to the 

head of his table & giving them the best 

he had served unto them by his own wife 

the vary woman they had refused to see 

her husband as he was taken from her by 

the force of Arms unlawfully after dining 

they all repaired to the Court Room whare 

the Municipal Court of the City of Nauvoo 

sat & Joseph Smith was deliverd into their 

hands for trial & as for Reynolds & 

Wilson they certainly did look sheepish 

for they were guilty & had done wrong

President Smith got onto a waggon & 

said to the multitude (before he went to 

Court) I am out of the hands of the 

Missourians thank God, & thanked the 

people for their kindness & love to him 

& said I will again address you at the 

grove near the temple at 4 oclock. after 

introducing the subject to the Court he said 

he had an appointment to speak to the 

people & he wish the privilege. The Court 

adjourned untill next morning at 8 oclok 

President Joseph Smith then went to 

the grove took the stand in the midst 

of about seven thousand Saints the 

resu[l]t is as follows



 END_ENTRY The following is a synopsis of the address 

deliverd by President Joseph Smith to the 

citizens of Nauvoo June 30th 1843



I repuire attention. I discoverd what 

the emotions of the people were on my arival 

to this city, & I have come here to say, how 

do you do to all parties & I do now say How do 

you do at this time. I meet you with a heart 

full of gratitude to Almighty God & I presume 

you all feel the same I hardly know how to 

express my feelings I feel as strong as a 

Gient I pulled sticks with the men coming 

along & I pulled up the strongest man 

theire was on the road with one hand & 

two could not pull me up & I continued 

to pull untill I pulled them to Nauvoo I will 

pass from that subject then. There has been 

great excitement in the Country & since 

those men took me I have been cool & 

dispassionate through the whole: thank God I 

am now in the hands of the Municipal 

Court of Nauvoo & not in the hands of 

Missourians. It has been discussed by 

the great & wise men Layif lawyiers &c 

O your Powers & legal tribunals are not 

to be sanctioned & here we will [not] make it 

lawful to drag away inocent men from 

their families & friends & have them unla-

wfully put to death by ungodly men for ther 

religion. Relative to our Charter Courts 

right of Hebeas Corpus &c we have all 

power: And if any man from this time 

forth says any thing contrary; cast



 END_ENTRY it into his teeth. Their is a secret in 

this; if their is not power in our Charter, 

and Courts, then there is not power in 

the State of Illinois, nor in the Congress 

^or Constitution^ of the United States for the United States 

gave unto Illinois her constitution, & Charter 

& Illinois gave unto Nauvoo her Charters 

which have ceded unto unto us our vested 

rights & has no right or power to take them 

from us all the power their was in the Illinois 

she gave to Nauvoo. And any man that says 

to the contrary is a fool. I want you to learn 

O Israel what is for the happiness & peace of this 

City & people. If our enemies are determined to 

oppress us & deprive us of our rights & privileges 

as they have done & if the Authorities that be 

on the earth will not assist us in our rights nor 

give us that protection which the Laws & Constitu-

tion of the United States & of thi[s] State garre-

ntees unto us: then we will claim them from 

higher power from heaven & from God 

Almighty & the Constitution &c I SWEAR 

I will not deal so mildly with them again 

for the time has come when forbearance is no 

longer a virtue, and if you are again taken 

unlawfully you are at liberty to give loose to 

Blood and Thunder. But act with Almighty Power.

But good luck for me as it always has been in evry 

time of trouble friends though strangers were 

raised up unto me & assisted me. The time has 

come when the veil is torn of[f] from the State of 

Illinois & they have deliverd me from the State 

of Missouri: friends that were raised up unto me 

would have spilt their blood for me to have delive-

red me then I told them not I would be delivered END_ENTRY By the power of God & Generalship & I have 

brought them to Nauvoo & treated them kindly 

I have had the privilege of rewarding them 

good for evil, they took me unlawfully treated 

me rigorously, strove to deprive me of my 

rights & would have run me to Missouri to have 

been murdered if providence had not inter-

posed: but now they are in my hands, I took 

them into my house set them at the head 

of my table & set the best before them my 

house afforded & they were waited upon by 

my wife whome they deprived of seeing 

me when I was taken. I shall be discharged 

by the Municipal Court of Nauvoo, were I 

before any good tribunal I should be 

discharged. But befor I will bear this 

unhallowed persecution any longer I will 

spill my blood their is a time when bearing 

it longer is a sin. I will not bear it longer 

I will spil the last drop of blood I have and 

all that will not bear it longer say AH. And 

the cry of AH rung throughout the Congrega-

tion we must stop paying the lawyiers money 

for I have learned they dont know any thing 

for I know more than they all. Whosoever 

believeth that there is power in the Charters 

of Nauvoo shall be saved he that believeth not 

shall not come here. If a lawyer shall say 

their is more power in other places & Charters 

than in Nauvoo believeth it not I have converted 

this Canditate for congres Mr Walker I 

suppose when I see him Converted I will 

vote for him & not before I have been with 

these lawyers & they have treated me well 

But I am here in Nauvoo & the Missourian to



 END_ENTRY & when they will get out I dont know perhaps 

when some others may. However you may 

feel about the high hand of oppression, I wish

you to restrain your hand from violence 

^against these men who arestd me^ 

My word is at stake a hair of their heads shall 

not be harmed. My life is pledged to carry out this 

great work. I know how readily you are to do right

you have done great things & manifested your love 

in flying to my assistance on this occasion. I 

could not have done better myself, and I bless 

you in the name of the Lord with all Blessings 

may you not have to suffer as you have here-

tofore. I know the Almighty will bless all good men

he will bless you: and the time has come when 

their shall be such a flocking to the Standard 

of Liberty as never has been, nor never shal be 

hereafter. what an erie of things has commenced 

Shall the Prophecys be esstablished by the Swords 

Shall we allways bear, NO. Will not the State 

of Missouri stay her hand in her unhallowed 

persecutions against the Saints; if not, I 

restrain you not any longer; I say in the name 

of Jesus Christ I this day turn the key [FIGURE] that 

opens the heavens to restrain you no longer from 

this time forth. I will lead you to battle & if 

you are not afraid to die & feel disposed to spill 

your Blood in your own defence you will not 

offend me. Be not the aggressor bear untill they 

strike on the one cheek offer the other & they 

will be sure to strike that, then defend yourselves 

& God shall bear you off. Will any part ot 

Illinois say we shall not have our rights treat them 

as strangers & not friends & let them go to Hell 

Say some we will mob you, mob & be damed. if 

I [am] under the necssity of giving up our charted END_ENTRY rights, privileges & freedom which our fathers 

fought bled & died for & which the Constitution 

of the United States & & this State garrentee 

unto us, I will do it at the point of the 

Bayonet & sword. Many Lawyiers contend 

for those thing which are against the rights of 

men & I can ownly excuse them because of their 

ignorance. Go forth & Advocate the laws & 

rights of the people ye lawyiers if not dont get 

into my hands or under the lash of my tongue

Lawyiers say the powers of the Nauvoo Charters 

are dangerous. But I ask is the Constitution of 

the United States or of this State dangerous, No 

neither are the charters granted unto Nauvoo

by the legislator of Illinois dangerous, & those that 

say they are are fools. We have not our 

rights those which the Constitution of the 

U.S.A. grant, & which our Charters grant

we have not enjoyed unmolested, Missouri 

& all wicked men will raise the hugh & cry

against us and are not satisfyed. But how 

are you going to help yourselves what will 

mobocrats do in the midst of this people, If 

mobs come upon you any more here, dung 

your gardings with them. But says one you 

will get up excitement we will get up no excitement 

except what we can find an escape from 

We will rise up Washington like & break of[f] 

the wait that bears us down & we will not 

be mobed.



To give you an account 

of my Journey, I will give you an anecdote that 

may be pleasing. A few days before I was taken 

I rode with my wife through a Neighborhood to 

visit some friends & I said to Mrs Smith here 

is a good people I felt this by the spirit of God END_ENTRY the next day I was in their hands a prisioner 

with Wilson who said as he drove up 

ha, ha ha By God we have got the prophet, he 

gloried much in it, But he is now our prisioner

When Reynolds of Missouri & Wilson of Carthage 

came to take me the first salutation was (instead 

of taping me on the sho^u^lder & saying you are my prision

er) with two cocked pistols to my head God damn 

you I will shoot you I will shoot you God damn you 

I will shoot you nearly 50 times first & last I asked 

them what they wanted to shoot me for, if you 

make any resistance. O vary well says I I 

have no resistance to make they then dragged 

me away & while on the road I asked them by 

what authority they did these things they said 

by a writ from the Govornors of Missouri & Illinois

I then told them I wanted a writ o[f] Habeas 

Corpus, the reply was God damn you you shant 

have it; I told a man to Go to Dixon & get me a 

writ of Habeas Corpus the reply was by 

Willson God dam you you shant have it I will 

shoot you, I sent for a lawyier to come one 

came & Reynolds shut the door in his face & would 

not let me speak to him & said again God damn 

you I will shoot you I turned to him opened my 

bosom & told him to shoot away & I did it freeq-

uently, I told Mr Reynolds that I would have 

Council to speak to & the Lawyers came to me 

& I got a writ of Habeas Corpus for mysel[f] & got 

a writ for Reynolds & Wilson for unlawful 

procedings towards me & cruel treatment they 

could not get out of town that night, I pleged my 

honor to my counci[l] that the Nauvoo Charter had 

power to investigate the subject & we came to 

Nauvoo by common consent & I am now END_ENTRY June 30

a prisioner of higher authority yes higher 

Authority before yourselves. The Charter 

expressly says that the City Council shall have 

power to enact all laws for the benefit & 

convenience of said City not contrary to 

the Constitutions of the United States or 

of this State & the City ordinance says the 

Municipal Court shall have power to give writs 

of Habeas Corpus arising under the ordinances 

of the City; Their is nothing but what we 

have power over excepted restricted by 

the Constitution of the United States or 

of this state. It is in accordance wih the 

Constitution of the U.S.A. But says the mob 

what dangerous powers, But the Constitution 

of the United nor of this State is not danger

ous against good men, but bad men the 

breakers of the law so with the laws of 

the country & so with the laws of Nauvoo they 

are dangerous to mobs but not good men that

wish to keep the law. We do not go out of 

Nauvoo to disturb any body or any city towon 

or place why need they be troubled about 

us let them not meddle with our affairs but 

let us alone. After we have been deprived 

of our rights & privileges as citizenship driven 

from town to town place to place state 

to state, with the sacrifice of our homes & 

lands & our blood been shed & many murde

red & all this becaus of our religion, because 

we worship Almighty God according to the 

dictates of our own consience shall we longer 

bear these cruelties which have been heaped 

upon us for the last ten years in the face 

of heaven & in open open violation of END_ENTRY me from him, & I had an opportunity to have 

killed him but I had no temptation to do it to 

him nor any other man, my worst enemy not 

even Boggs in fact he would have more hell 

to live in the reflection of his past life than to 

die. My freedom commenced from the time 

the old man came to me & would talk to me

we came direct from Papa grove to Nauvoo

we got our writ directed to the nearest 

court having authority to try try the case & 

we came to Nauvoo. It did my soul good to 

see your feelings & love manifest towards me

I thank God that I have the honor to lead so 

virtuous & honest a people to be your leader & 

lawyier as Moses to the children of Israel

Hosannah Hosannah Hosannah Hosannah 

to the name of the Most High God I commend 

you to his grace & may the Blessings of heaven 

rest upon you in the name of Jesus Christ Amen



Furthermore if Missouri continues her warfare 

& continues to issue her writs against me & this peopl

unlawfully & unjustly as they have done & our 

rights are trampled upon & they under take to take 

away my wrights I sware with uplifted hands to 

Heaven I will spill my blood in its defence they 

shall not take away our rights & if they dont 

stop leading me by the nose I will lead them by 

the nose & if they dont let me alone I will turn 

up the world I will make war, when we shake 

our own bushes we want to ketch our own fruit

The Lawyiers themselves acknowledge that we 

have all power granted us in our Charters that we 

could ask for, that we had more power than 

any other court in the state for all other Courts were restricted END_ENTRY while ours was not & I thank God Almighty for 

it & I will not be rode down to Hell by the 

Missourians any longer, & it is my privilege to 

speak in my own defence & appeal to your honor [FIGURES]





After this interesting & decisive address was deliverd 

in the presence of about seven or eight thousand the 

multitude dispersed & went to their homes







July 1, 1843 ~ Saturday





July 1st 1843 The Municipal Court opened at 

8 oclock AM President Joseph Smith made 

some remarks to the lawyiers his Council, as he was 

a prisioner before the Court. President Joseph Smith 

then called upon Hiram Smith, Brigham Young 

P P Pratt Lyman Wight & Sidney Rigdon who 

were duly sworn & gave in their testimony, which 

occupied most of the day they went through the 

whole scene of the persecution from Jackson 

County to the time of their expulsion from the 

State by force of Armes & it was certainly 

the most heart rending seene or rehearsal of it that 

ever saluted the ears of any tribunal in a cifilized 

government it would have disgraced an arab or 

Hotentot, not ownly theft, Arson, Burgalry, prisons 

chains, expulsion rape & Murder were practiced 

upon the saints without any redress but even 

President Joseph Smith with his companions in 

prision loaded with chains were FED with nothing 

for FIVE Days in succession but the Flesh of their 

OWN BRETHREN which was actaully cooked & 

given to them to eat & while hearing this part of the 

testimony my blood boiled within & the spirit of war



 END_ENTRY rested upon me for the space of two days. The 

Lawyiers were shocked to the soul each one made 

a speach at the close of the testimony & they exhort'd 

us to stand for our rights stand or fall sink or 

swim live or die the whole testimony will 

be published to the world in pamphlet form & 

probably other wise & will stand as a history to 

future generations of the unparelled persecution 

of the State of Missouri against the Saints of 

the last days





July 2, 1843 ~ Sunday



 

July 2nd Sunday met at the grove near the temple 

A large congregation assembled & was addressed 

in an interesting manner by Elder O Hyde 

from the 3 ch of the Epistle of John the Divine 

2, 3 & 4 verses & said much to the edifycation 

of the people. After elder Hyde closed, Mr Walker 

& three other Lawyers spoke in rotation & upheld 

President Joseph Smith in his procedings & spoke 

of the unlawful conduct of his enemies





July 3, 1843 ~ Monday





July 3rd A special conference of elders was called 

& one or two appointed to go to each County in the 

State of Illinois. An address was deliverd to the 

Elders By President Rigdon who made some 

useful remarks among others he said all that 

greatness consisted in, in public speaking with any 

man was in delivering a chain of Ideas that the 

man had well matured speaking of things that 

he knew & not of things that he did not know 

for should he speak of things he does not know

he would set a trap to be caught in, but when 

a person understands the subject thorougholy upon 

which he is speaking he knows how to defend it

This is all the greatest man on earth can do is to



 END_ENTRY tell the truth & speak of things he knows. 

The Elders were also addressed by Elder B Young





July 4, 1843 ~ Tuesday





JULY 4th 1843 

[FIGURE] As the Romans took particular notice of any 

singular event as ominous of Good or evil so I 

will record a small circumstance that took place 

in my house this morning. Soon after I arose 

in the morning on this 4th Day of July my 

wword while hanging in its usual place unsheathed 

of itself & the scabbard droped upon the 

floor leaving the bear blade suspended from the 

peg upon which it hung 

As this is the 4th we call it a happy day for 

Nauvoo. At a vary early hour people began to 

assemble at the grove & at 11 oclock near 13,000 

thousand persons had congregated, who were 

addressed in a vary able and appropriat 

manner by Elder Orson Hyde lately from 

Palestine, and who has recently been appointed 

on a mission to St Petersburgh, Russia. A 

constant accession of numbers swelled the 

congregation to 15,000 as near as could be estimated 

& at 2 oclock they were again addressed by 

Elder Parley P. Pratt in a masterly discourse 

followed by President Joseph Smith upon 

the subject of the late arest & persecution 

who clearly vindicated his innocence & 

showed the corruption of his pursueers in 

a tru light. Three steamers arived in the 

afternoon—one from St Louis one from 

Quincy & one from Burlington—bringing altogether



 END_ENTRY about 900 visiting ladies and gentlemen 

to our City. On the arival of each boat they 

were escorted to the stand by the Nauvoo 

band and the escort companies whare convenient 

seats were provided & whare they were 

welcomed by the firing of cannon which brought 

to our minds the last words of the patriot 

Jefferson:- -Let this day be celebrated by the 

firing of cannon &c. The legion was not 

out.



The following is a 

synopsis of the Address of President Joseph Smith 

while speaking in his own defence before about 

15,000 souls



If the people will give ear a momen[t] 

I will address them, with few words in my own 

defence as touching my arest. In the first 

place I will state to these that can hear me 

that I never spent more than six months 

in Missouri except while in prison, while I 

was there I was at work for the suppor[t] of 

my family. I never was a prisioner of war 

during my stay for I had not made war, I 

never took a pistol a gun, or sword & the much 

that has been said on this subject is false I 

have been willing to go before any governor 

Judge or tribunal whare justice could be done 

& have the subject investigated. I could not 

have committee treason in that state while 

there I had no controll any whare in temporal 

things while there but in spiritual I was 

driven from that state by force of 

arms under the exterminating order of 

Govornor Boggs. I have never commited 

treason the people know vary well I



 END_ENTRY have Been a peaceable citizen but 

their has been a great hugh & cry about 

Jo Smith Govornor Bogs being shot, No 

crime can be done but what it is laid to 

Jo Smith. Here I was again dragged to 

the United States court, & was cleared 

& now it comes again. But as often as 

God sees fit for me to suffer I am ready 

But I am as innocent of these crimes as the 

Angels in heaven.  I am not an enemy to manki-

nd I am a friend to Mankind. I ^am^ not an enemy 

to Missouri nor any any governors or people 

As to the military station I hold & the cause 

of my holding it is as follows. When we came 

here the State required us to bear arms & do 

military duty according to law, & as the Church 

had just been driven from the State of Missou-

ri & robed of all their property & arms they were 

poor & destitute of armes: they were liable 

to be fined for not doing duty when they had not 

arms to do it with, they came to me for advice 

I advised them to organize themselves into inde-

pendant companies, & demand arms of the 

State, this they did. Again their were many 

Elders having licence to preach which by law 

exhonorated them from Military duty but the 

officiers would not release them on this ground 

I then told the saints that though I was clear 

from Military duty by law in consequence 

of lameness in one of my legs, yet I would 

set them the example & would do duty my-

self, they then said they were willing to do duty 

if they could be formed into an independant 

company & I could be at their head & upon 

this ground came the Nauvoo Legion & I



 END_ENTRY holding the office of Lieutenant General 

not that I seek for power. & with regard 

to elections some say we all vote together & 

we vote as I say: But I never tell any man how to vote 

or who to vote for. But I will show you how 

we have been situated by bringing a comparison 

Should their be a Methodist society here & 

two candidates running for office: one says 

if you will vote for me & put me in governor 

I will exterminate the Methodist take away their 

Charters &c. The other Candidate says if I am 

Govornor I will give all an equal privilege, which 

would the Methodist vote for, of course they would 

vote in mass for the candidate that would give 

them their rights; thus it has been with us 

Joseps Duncon said if the people would elect 

him he would exterminate the mormons & take 

away their Charters. As to Mr Ford he made no 

such threats, but manifested a spirit in his spea-

ches to give every man their rights; hence the 

Church universally voted for mr Ford & 

he was elected govornor; But he has 

issued writs against me the first time the 

Missourians made a demand for me & this is 

the second one he has issued for me which has 

caused me much trouble & expense. President 

Smith also rehearsed the account of his being 

taken By Reynolds & Wilson & the unlawful 

treatment he received at their hands



The multitute gave good attention 

& much prejudice seemed to be removed

2nd I spent the day at 149 Oldham road in writing

I was informed of a remarkable vision of Sister Ann 

Booth which I have written on the following page

I spent the night at Br John Walkers Cookson Strt No 10



 END_ENTRY A Remarkable Vision





I Ann Booth wife of Robert Booth of the Town 

of Manchester England had the following vision on the 

12th Day of March in the year of our Lord 1840.





Being carried away in a vision to the place of depart

ed souls I saw 12 prision one above another vary 

large & builded of solled stone. On ariving at the door 

of the uppermost prision. I beheld one of the 12 Apostles 

of the Lamb who had been martered in America 

Standing at the door of the prision holding a key with 

which he unlocked the door & went in & I followed 

him. He appeared to be of a large size thick set. Dark hair 

Dark eyes & eyebrows of a smileing countenance, & on 

his head was a Crown of Gold or sumthing brighter. 

He was Dressed in a long white robe with the sleeves 

plaited from the sholder to the hand. Upon his breast 

were four stars * * * * apparrently like gold and a golden 

gridle about his loins. his feet were bear from above 

the ancles downwards and his hands were also bear. 

As he entered the prision he seemed to stand about 

3 feet from the floor (which was of Marble) as if 

the place was not worthy for him to stand upon. A 

vary ^brilient^ and glorious light serrounded him while the 

rest of the Prision was dark. But his light was pecu-

liar to himself & did not reflect upon others who were 

in the Prison who were surrounded with a gloom of darkne

ss. On the right hand near the door stood John Westley 

who on seeing the glorious Personage raised both hands 

& shouted Glory, honor. Praise, & Power be asscribed 

unto God & the Lamb forever & forever Deliverence has 

Come. The Apostle then Commenced to Preach the 

Baptism of repentance for remission of Sins and the 

gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. 

When the hunderds of Prisoners gave a shout with a 

loud voice saying Glory be to God forever & ever

The marble floor was then removed & a river of water 

clear as Cristle seemed to flow in its place. The Apostle 

then called to John Westley by name who came forw-

ard quickley and both went down into the water & 

he Baptized him & coming up out of the water he 

laid hands on him for the gift of the Holy Ghost at the 

same time ordaining him to the Priesthood of Aaron

The Apostle then retired to the place whare he stood at



 END_ENTRY first and John Westley then proceded to Baptize 

A man by the name of Killham the leader of the New 

Connection of Methodist and next John Madison & then 

Scott, & John Tongue, the three latter were Methodist 

Preachers with whom I had formerly been acquainted

the next he Baptized was my Grandfather (Edmund 

Whitehead) & the next was my Uncle (John Whitehead) 

& the next was my sister (Elizabeth Olland) & next 

Joseph Lancashire & next Samuel Robinson & the

next was my own Mother all these had lived & died 

Methodist & I had been personally acquainted with 

them all. And after this he Baptized all the prisoners 

amounting to many hundreds. After they were 

all Baptized the Apostle laid his hands on them & 

Confirmed them evry one. then instantly the darkness 

dispersed & they were all surrounded & envelloped in 

A Brilient light such as surrounded the Apostle at the 

first & they all lifted their voices with one accord 

giving glory to God for deliverance. My Grandfather 

then came to me & blessed me saying the Lord bless 

the[e] forever & ever. art thou come to see us delivered

My mother then came to me & clasped me in her arms 

& kissed me three times & said the Lord Allmighty 

bless thee forever & ever. I then awoke out of 

the vision & felt so happy & overjoyed that I 

knew not how to remain in bed. But waking my 

husband we arose & taking the Bible I opened prom

Providentially to the text Isaiah 24th they shall be 

gathered together &c more & more astonished. I 

opened agained the Bible  I again opened the Bible to the 1st 

of St John The light shineth in darkness &c. and again the 

third time I opened it & immediately cast my eyes upon 

the 3rd chapter of Peter 18. 19. 20. speaking of the spirits 

in Prison. Being before ignorant of these texts & opening 

upon each Providentially I was asstonished beyound meas

ure. I would further state that at the time I had this 

vision I had never herd of the Death of David W. Patten 

whom I have since learned was one of the Twelve 

Apostles of the Latter Day Saints in America & was slain 

in the late persecution in the fall of 1838. But in the 

vision I knew it was an Apostle who had been slain 

in America. Perhaps many will think lightly of this 

vision But I hereby Sollemnly testify that I actaully 

Saw & herd in a vision what I have here related & I 

give my name & set my seal in witness to the Same 

well knowing that I must stand before the Judgment Seat of 

Christ & answer for this Testimony &



 END_ENTRY SIGNS IN THE LAST DAYS





On the 9th of Aug 1840 their was a sign in the Moon

the people at Great Marlvern Hills in Herefordshire Eng 

took a view of it through their glasses, the appearance 

of the moon was as if it were painted red & while 

looking at it one part of it fell in peices & the appearan

world— elements— nature— Condition of animals and the 

like, shall be literally accomplished." Truth

says all of those tribes will receive the work, & two

Elders with their families (Brothers Butler & Emmit)

people & turn ther captivity & spedily overshadow 

them with the light of the fulness of the gospel of 

Jesus Christ. Roll on O ye mighty wheel of the Kingdom

of God untill ye becom a mountain & fill the whole 

earth. Let the day which has now broke close no more 

untill Judah rejoices & Israel is made glad &

Ephraim's Nobles are of himself & his Governour procede

forth out of the midst of him. Let the prayer of 

the widow, & the cry of the Orphan assend into 

the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, let the heavens 

witness their tears & record them on high, untill 

the Almighty shall come out of his hiding place

& avenge those widows & orphens of the spilt Blood 

of their Martered husbands & Fathers which was 

shed by the Iron hand of the Inhabitants of Missouri

for the word of God & the testimon of Jesus Christ

Let the American Nation spedily learn that their is 

still a God in Israel who holds the destinies of 

all nations in his own hand & at whose command 

goes forth the issues of life & death. O Lord Cloth

thy Saints with Salvation & thine Elders with the 

Power of God. Give thy Prophets wisdom, means, &

power, to esstablish Zion & her stakes to be throne down 

no more forever; Make thy no Apostles men after thine 

own heart & swift witnesses to the nations of the 

earth let council, wisdom, & the fear of God rest

upon them untill all thy purposes are accomplished 

concerning them which thou wilt Deign to perform!!

Vinal haven is in Lat. 44. North. Long 69.10. East Pop. 1800. Maine 

Vinal haven includes both North & South fox Islands. The inhabitants 

are generally wealthy, healthy, intelligent, industrious, generous, and 

hospitable to strangers. The people get most of their wealth & living 

by fishing. The Town of Vinalhaven fits out rising of 100 licensed sail 

beside small craft. North fox Island is 9 miles long & 2 miles wide. Pop 

800. they have a Post office, one Store, a Baptist Church & meeting 

house & four school houses & a grist mill. The land is rather rocky 

& rough yet there is many good farms which produces good wheat, 

barley, oats, potatoes, & grass which is the staple production. The 

principal timber is fir, spruice, hemlock & birch. Sheep are the pri

ncipal stock upon the Island. Rasp. & Goose buries grow in great 

abundance.





South fox Island comes as near being without 

any form or void as any land I ever saw. It would be difficult 

for the best historian to give an exact description of it. It is about 

10 miles long & 5 broad and it is one universal mass of rocks formed 

into shelves, hills & dales cut up into necks & points to make room for 

the cooves & harbours that run through and through the Island. Pop is 

1000. They get their wealth entirely by fishing. Their principal stock is 

sheep. Their is some small parts of the Island under cultivation, but it is 

at the expense of great labour and toil. Many of the inhabitants of this 

Island fish at Newfoundland & bring their fish home & dry them upon 

their own flakes & prepare them for market. they supply the market 

annually with great quantities of dried fish, Mackerel & boxed 

herren. There is two stores, three tide saw mills. six school houses 

& a small branch of the methodist church & a priest. The timber is 

pine, fir, spruce, hemlock & birch. much of the timber & whoretlebury 

bushes grows out of the cracks of the rocks. Rasp & goose buries 

also grow in great quantities upon this Island



 END_ENTRY There is great quantities of fish inhabit the waters, cooves & harbours 

around these Islands, such as Whale. Blackfish, Shark, ground Shark, 

PILOT fish, Hors Mackerel, Sturgeon, Salmon, Holloboat, Cod, Pollock, 

Tom Cod, Hake, Haddock, Mackerel, Shad, Bass, Ale wives, Herren, 

Pohagen, Dolphin, Whiting, Frost fish, Flounders, Smelt, Skate, 

Shrimp, Skid, Susk, Blebacks, Scollop Dogfish, Muttonfish Lumpfish, 

Squid, Fivefingers, Monkfish, Nursfish, Sunfish, Swordfish, Thrasher,

remarks & was encouraged by some mob companions

untill confusion became general in the gallery, untill

and beaten badly by a set of young desperadoes. After

much hard fighting however they succeded in clearing

not dangerous the meeting was soon broaken up, this

is a disgrace to Boston & shows the spirit of the times

naries among the Indians trying to civelize them but

he thought they had better commence at home first

He thought it best to send some sax & fox indians to

Boston to civelize the city, But notwithstanding

the meeting was closed by a mob yet much good

was done, the citizens could see their was sufficient

reasons to awaken the minds of the people upon the

affairs of our goverment in order to save them from

ruin. The convention was adjourned untill tomorrow

tried whether they will abide in the covenant of God or 

not even tried unto death. I am satisfyed that all 

things will work together for the good of the saints, and 

when they are sufficiently tried they will be delivered

The Brethren returned from Saco bringing the latest 

news which sayes the mormon war had all fizzelid 

out that the general with his officers had showed 

their white feathers, & left the field, before a gun 

was fired, & so their was nothing to be done but to

disband the troops, as their is no fighting to be done when

July 13th [FIGURES]

We obtained information this morning from quincy 

as late as June 29th The Govonor had made Quincy 

his head Quarters for he could neither trust the 

people or Melitia in that region of country had 

made a Proclamation to the citizens of the 

State, would protect either Party against 

an attact. The mormons had done all that could 

be required of them. Still their appears to be 

a disposition of the people & troops to try to destroy 

Nauvoo. The Govonor acknowledges the death 

of the Prophet and Patriarch to be a wanton murder

We do not obtain one word from any of our 

friends so that we can obtain anything correct upon 

the subject. I hope we may get sumthing soon

I expect the mails are stoped. Mob spirit is rising through-

out the country Philadelphia is full of it. War 

is again Proclaimed against Texas by Mexico 

& the world is sheding the blood of Prophets,

Patriarch and Saints in order to fill up their cup

arived in the city also President B. Young we

met together had some council. I wrote a letter

to the Prophet, advising the Elders who have

families in Nauvoo to go immediately to them &

for all the authorities of the church to assemble

at Nauvoo for a council, by order of the quorum of

the Twelve Wilford Woodruff Clerk B. Young President

After which Elder O. Hyde and myself accompanied

Sister Voice to take tea with a sister who was attending

to a house near the state house fronting the common

we walked all over the house & took a view of the

furniture it could not have cost much less than

one hundred thousand dollars to have furnished the

it. After tea we walked to meeting in a hall in

Washington St opposite Boydston hall Elder

Hyde had advertised to Preach upon the murder

of Joseph and Hyram Smith and take up a collection

at the close to pay his expenses home.





The following is a brief synopsis of the same

The speaker read the 24 ch Matthew 9 to 14 verses

as the foundation of some remarks. Said he would

much rather leave the strife of men, and spend

his time in speaking of the gospel of Jesus Christ

But it is my design to night to speak upon the death

of the Prophet & Patriarch. Some might think because

of the death of the men it would put a stop to the 

work but not so, when God has sent a men at any

time they were opposed by the world, for any gener-

ation, that has a prophet of God in their midst they

see his weakness as touching human nature & the

people are watching for iniquity & they spend all

their time talking about any thing they see him

do that does not accord with their traditions &

tell a great many falshoods about him but entirely

forget and overlook all the good he does. It was



 END_ENTRY so with our Savior men looked upon him as an

impostor and Beelzebub the Prince of devils, and

when he was crucifyed they were not satisfyed

with his dying merely but went and thrust a

spear into his side and their came out Blood and

water. But how is it now with the Savior, all

profess to believe on him they dont talk about

what his persecutors said were his bad deeds but

his good ones. whan a man dies his bad deeds die

with him and his virtues live and grow brighter.

The gentiles say if I had lived in the days of the

Savior I would not have killed him but would have

rejoiced. But imagin yourselfs living in the

days of the an inspired man how would you

look upon him, as the worst of men the same as

they did. A man told me he dreamed that some

man spoke to him and said Lama, Lama, and

he looked and it was Joseph Smith retreating from

him and saying those words, the interpetation of

which is my God my God & when Joseph Smith

was shot he repeated those words. So with the

Savior when he was crucified he said Lama,

Lama, Sabaethana. As the Jews were not satisfied

with killing Jesus Christ, but must thrust a spear into

his side so with the gentiles they were not satisfied

with shooting the Prophet but stabed him with a

dagger in the breast, as so[o]n as they killed them they

all fled and in an hour their was not a man left in the

place, but the wicked flea when no man persues,

but why did the people murder this Prophet what

were they afraid of. O if he lives he will take

away our power of goverment get the rule in his

own hands and we will be distroyed, but they were

mistaken. If they had let him alone or had recie-

ved him he would have saved the nation from ruin

and destruction. But now the nation has got to

answer for his blood and the blood of his brother

both of which were the Lords anointed besids

& his household to enter into the new & everlasting covenant & to partake of the blessings of the 

Kingdom of the kingdom of God yet satan striveth to hender them & rageth against us all beca

use a blessing is near. O Lord preserve us from his grasp I pray that we may have a victory & that 

we may have an answer to our prayers & that the Revelations of Jesus Christ may be fulfilled to my Joy



 END_ENTRY July 1, 1838 ~ Sunday





JULY 1st 1838. On this seventh month the first day of the month and the first day of the week 

which is called Sunday some of the most important events transpired with me that I ever witness-

ed since I had a being, events worthy to be recorded upon the ARCHIEVES OF HEAVEN o or to 

be engraven with an iron pen & laid in a rock forever upon the EARTH. For I know that my Redeemer 

liveth & he hath this day given me with my friends a victory over the Devil that tries the souls of men that dwell

upon the face of the earth. My Father Aphek Woodruff, the son of Eldad Woodruff, which was the Son of Josiah 

Woodruff, is a man that hath been seeking religion & the favor of God & light & truth for many years at times, & for 

more than 20 years have a numerous circle of friends made his case a subject of Prayer & pled with God in his 

behalf. But as oft as my father hath strugled for a victory over sin & its influence heretofore Satan hath temp-

ted him & hindered him from gaining the victory. But since I had beame a member of the Church of Latter Day Saints & 

entered the New & Everlasting Covenant & had a dispensation of the gospel committed unto me, I felt a deeper interest 

than ever in the salvation of the soul of my Father. I had now come to declare a message to my father & his houshold 

& teach them words whareby they might be saved. I began to cry unto God for my father & his houshold & the Lord 

showed me in a night vision that a great victory was nigh, but the devil fell upon the whole household with great 

wrath & tempations some of the time one was ready to fall back & reject the gospel & then again annother. his 

power rested upon me at the same time as if to devour me at once but after being confined to my bed for several 

hours under his grasp, in the name of Jesus Christ I with my friends birst the Powers of darkness. I went & stood befo-

re the people & declaired the gospel of Jesus Christ, & shout O Heavens and rejoice O earth for the victory the Lord 

hath given us for after preaching the gospel to the peopl, I immediately assembled upon the bank of Farmington river 

whare there was much water & lead six of my friends into the waters of Baptism five of them were my relatives 

viz my Father, my Mother, & my ownly sister Eunice, aunt Anna Cossett, & Cousin Seth Woodruff & the other was 

Mr Dwight Webster a methodist class leader. We returned from the water rejoiceing & confirmed them by the laying 

on of hands at my fathers house. I organized this small branch of the church being 9 in number 8 of which were my relatives 

I ordained Brother Dwight Webster to the office of a Priest. I communed with these saints & unbosomed my feelings unto

them which closed the scenes of this interesting day which have come to pass in fullfilment of my Patriarchal blessing under the hands 

of the Patriarch JOSEPH



 END_ENTRY See Journal Vol 1st April 15. 1837.





Great and marvelous are thy Works O LORD GOD ALMIGHTY





Written upon what came to pass on the first day of July AD 1838 in fulfillment of Revelation





O GOD my heart inspire my pen direct while I record this scene of thy 

mercy this blessing of thy love a blessing promised me by the testimony 

of JESUS CHRIST. Could I claim it yes by faith all things are possible even that 

my parents & friends could in the new covenant with me stand. Without shame 

I stood the gospel to declare. It was a sword to pierce the hearts of my friends. 

The day has come: they felt that God had sent they must obey. O'er the thresh- 

hold of my father's house I walked accompanied by my friends towa-

rds the appointed place we bent our way untill upon the rivers bank we 

stood. All nature spread her fields of pleasing green. The canal 

bold in her bed lay ready her inland commerce to convey. The sun 

shed forth her golden beams to gladden earth while the silver 

stream was rolling at my feet as if to say I am ready for thee 

amid this scenery with feelings better imagined than described 

I cast my eyes upon the audiance while we sung praises to the 

God of Israel. Who would not have bowed the knee while offe-

ring the sacrifice of the heart and imploreing the blessings of hea-

ven that the spirit of God the candidates & the waters might 

pervade. As from our knees we arose I entered the wattery element 

and asked who was ashamed of the bed whare Jesus lay. Many 

eyes were turned to behold this scene and deep solemnity veiled 

their faces while I took my Father by the hand, my Father did I 

say yes HE covenanted to walk with God and for the remission 

of his sins I Baptized him. Feeling the victory won my Mother 

followed his steps and by obediance was sealed a saint a member 

of the kingdom. Eunice my sister my ownly sister was ready her 

noble soul by Ephraim's spirit inspired her garb of pride had rent 

and broke the gentiles chain, fearless of the world's despiseing 

she freely recieved the watery bed her Master to imitate while her 

firm example should say celestial glory is my boast the garb of 

saints my pride





For the consolation of Israel Anna long had look'd and rejoiced 

that she could now the ancient path persue, upon the scene her 

daughters gazed as if to say Great God prepare us likewise thy 

will to do. Seth in his early youth was not to young his God to se-

rve, he desired to follow the example of his father, mother, and brother 

that they might be one. Ozem, Hannah, and John, the Parents & brother 

of Seth were baptized on the 12 of July 1839 as my Journal declares 

Dwight though not of consanguine blood to me desired baptism 

at my hands for by the blood of Christ we were united, 

thrice the cross he strove to pass & as oft the spirit pressed his 

honest soul & he submitted to obey. Thus ended this scene of 

wonder shall I say? yes and of mercy to, for heaven counten-

ance'd the deed for it was Gods command an ordinance of the 

gospel. TO be permitted to stand in ones own native land and the gosp-

el of JESUS CHRIST to declare in the last dispensation & while 

dividing the word through the power of the priesthood to his kindred 

his townsman to behold the pride of the great, the rich, the lea-

rned, by the spirit of God humbled at his feet then to exper-

ience the living reality of a Father, a Mother, an ownly Sister 

meekly with other kindred receiving the ordinances of the 

house of God at the hand of their son and brother is to me 

at least a scene of Interest. As we retired from the rolling 

stream to a Father's roof my spirit was ready to say forget this 

not O my soul regard it as the mercy of thy God while thou dost 

pay thy vows thy covenants fulfill. While upon the head of these 

Saints my hands were lade I implored the mercy of God for the 

Holy Ghost upon them to rest & guide them right. The bread and wi-

ne was bles'd & we partook to remember him who died for us. O, Eternal 

God these Saints inspire, protect, support, defend & untill in Zion they stand 

and with celestial glory crowned an heir with GOD AND CHRIST

that try the souls of men but out of them all the Lord delivers his Saints. I also spent a short time 

with Sister Eunice before retireing we mingled our sympathys tears & prayers together before a Throne 

of grace, truly how strong is the cord of consanguinity & of the Blood of Christ united in binding the

the bed of his saints in their sickness & that amid there deepest wounds of affliction & sorrow 

Pain or distress it is safe to trust in HIM. Mrs Woodruff was called at an early hour this

while the sun was sitting in the western horizon. I retired aside from the abodes of men by the sea shore 

alone by myself and clensed my feet with pure water and bore testimony before GOD against the in-

31st The last day of summer. I rode in company with Mrs Woodruff & Sister Rhoda F. Scamman to the 

Beach on the Sea Shore. we spent an hour riding upon this beautiful beach which extended along the shore 

for about seven miles in length and one hundred rods in wedth at low water, this beach is composed of fine 

white sand, almost dead level & vary easy & plesent to ride or walk upon. The sun shone brilliant upon the 

face of nature. The canvass of the gallant ships were filled with the morning breeze as they sailed upon 

the deep, wave after wave were reaching the extent of their bounds upon the shore & sinking back 

into there own gravity, these together with a cloud of various sea fouls that were hovering around and 

lighting upon the water rendered this morning's excursion vary plesent to our feelings, and after picking 

up a quantity of sea shells to carry to the land of Zion for domestic uses, & in memory of the place, we 

cut up a babary bush from whence babary tallow is obtained & then rode from the beach & returned to Mr 

Scamman's from thence we rode to Brother Edward Milliken's from thence to Mr Samuel Lowels, & to 

Aaron Mckinney's & after spending several hours with them, we returned home in company with

Sept 8th For the first time in my life I obtained the Journal & travels of Lorenzo Dow I spent a 

part of the day in reading it I found it to be highly interesting he puts me in mind of the travels of 

the Mormons as the gentiles call us It brings fresh to mind many of my own travels & labours in the ministry 

It is true that Lorenzo Dow was eccentric in his manners life & procedings but he appears to have as much 

light as any in his day & generation & there is no doubt in my mind but that he was persecuted for doing good

Satan is stired up to try to hinder myself and wife from going to Zion 

may the Lord rebuke him [FIGURE] I wrote a Letter to sister Eliza Grant & spent the night at Father Carters

our child has a severe attack of the Hooping Cough but the Lord is able to support her on the Journey to Zion I pray 

the Lord to spare her life for our sake's if it is his will if not to help us to be resigned. Isaiah tells us about 

going to Zion in the last days and about the prosperity & glorious state thereof and Jer 31 ch 8. sayes they shall be 

gathered from the co^a^sts of the earth & with them the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together & 

a great company shall return thither. I expect in few days to lead a company to Zion in like circumstances may 

God bless us all on the way O the ignorance, blindness, & darknes of the gentiles, concerning the fulfillment of the Bible

10 [FIGURES] This is a day of Interest on many accounts The election for Governor & other state officers 

of Maine is to be decided this day. Also the Camp of the Saints was to start from the Islands of the Sea for 

Zion this day however they may be detained from starting a few days in order to add to their numbers. I rode 

to the place of election with Ilus & Fabyan Carter my Brothers in law. As I was a legal voter in the state 

of Maine I cast in my vote which was the Democratic Republican Ticket viz for Governor JOHN FAIRFIELD 

Representative to congress ALBERT SMITH. For senators NATANIEL S. LITTLEFIELD, CHARLES HOLDEN, 

OTIS C. GROSS. & JOHN C. HUMPHREYS. For County Treasurers MARK HARRIS. Regester of Deeds 

SAMUEL BAKER. The above vote I cast on this 10th day of Sept 1838 in Scarborough, Cumberland County. Maine



 END_ENTRY Sept 10th After returning from the Election [FIGURE] I recieved an interesting Letter from Mother Woodruff 

under date of Sept 7th which was written at Simsbury Connecticut while she was on a visit to Si[s]ter 

Anna Cossett's. She informed me they were all strong in faith of the new covenant & sister Eunice 

firmly contending for the truth & others of my relatives were believing in the cause of the Latter Day Saints 

what Joy such intelligence brings to my soul. O how mysterious are the ways of God! I spent the 

night at father Carters. Distance 8 miles





September 11, 1838 ~ Tuesday





11th I perused the Portland Argus & saw the returnes of the Election of Cumberland County the 

republicans had a majority over the federalist of about 100. I expect the electionereing excitement 

will pass off in few day & sumthing els will occupy the minds of men. [FIGURE] I learn from experienc 

that the Saint must watch & pray lest he enter into tempation & in order to overcome the 

devil we must continually be on our watch tower, the Saint in any age of the world cannot 

pass through their allotted portion of existance on flowery beds of ease in this life. I am now daily making 

preperations to leave the state of Maine and all my relatives and friends in Scarborough to lead a company 

of Saints from the Islands of the Sea to the land of Zion in the far west. I shall be accompanied by 

my wife & child. It is the greatest trial Phebe has ever been called to pass through to take the parting 

hand of her Parents, Brethren & Sisters, & neighbours & perhaps for the last time, & go a journey of 

two thousand miles late in the fall & start with a babe of two monts old which is in the first stage 

of the hooping cough & to add to this to leave a kind father's house of plenty & go to a new country & 

settle among strangers after the flesh. These kind reader are the meditations that are daily running 

with the rapidity of lighting through the mind of my bosom friend & companion & to add the insinuation 

of friends against such a course of procedings, and all the temptations that the devil is capable of 

inventing are crouded into the mind in order to hinder the will of God being done. Thus standing in the 

midst of such a position nothing but a saint could stand the shock nothing but a God could support the 

sinking soul. I speak not of myself but my companion and when she suffers I suffer also. The above has 

been a code of experience my wife hath been passing through from time to time for weeks that are

HALOS AND PHARHELIA





This morning, bet[w]een the hours of six and 

nine oclock, the heavens exhibited a splen-

did and delightful appearance, of halos or 

circles accompanied with parhelia or mock 

suns. Clouds of a white & fleecy appearance 

were at the time floating in the atmosphere, 

but so thin as not to entirely obscure the blue 

sky the wind blue vary gently from the west 

by northwest. The cold being intense essp-

ecially for the time of year and small crysta-

ls of ice or snow were visible s floating in the air

The following diagram represents these beau-

tiful phenomena as they appeared about half 

past seven oclock A.M. The magnitudes of the 

circles given in the following decription may not 

be exact as I was destitute of the proper inst

ruments for their accurate measurement.

vary bright prism-

atic circle not 

far from 45°

nearly 41–2°. Its breadth 

and colours were about the 

same as that of a common 

rainbow nearly all the prismatic colours

part of the circle next [to] the sun. On each 

side of the sun at a and b towards the north 

and south there were two mock suns of 

different colours vary splendid & bright 

in their appearance.





2nd The sun was 

encircled by another halo, k n i m, much 

larger than the former, and parellel to it 

being nearly 90° in diameter and its lower 

limb being sunk below the horizen about 

27°. It exhibited the same colours as the 

first though not so bright. ^3rd^ At the top of 

these circles at e and i, were two inverted 

arches whose common centre seemed 

to lay in the Zenith. The upper arch f i h 

was exeedingly brilliant and beautifully 

coloured and appeared to be about 

54° degrees in diameter and that of the 

lower one d c e about 99°. Annother 

Parhelion or mock sun appeared in the 

middle of the lower arch, at c whare it 

coincided with the circle first described 

but its colours and brightness were much 

inferior to those of the collateral mock 

suns at a and b.





4th There appeared 

a circle in b s a n t r, much larger 

than any I have yet described being 

about 144° in diameter and of a uniform 

whiteness. It was about 18 degrees above 

the horizen, and parallel to it passing through 

the tru sun, s, and the collateral parhelia 

a, and b and also through two other 

parhelia, t and r, sumthing about 

90 or 100° from the sun one towards 

the north & the other towards the south.

April 16th 

President J. Smith Addressed the assem-

bly of the saints at the temple of the Lord

upon the subject of the saints death burial 

& resurrection of the saints. He had been 

requested to preach a funeral sermon by 

several persons who had died lost friends 

& he had Just Received information that 

Elder Lorenzo Barnes had died in England 

we received this information by a letter from 

Elder P. P. Pratt. After reading the letter he 

addressed the assembly in a vary feeling 

interesting & edefying manner among 

many other remarks he said he should 

have been more reconciled to the death of Elder 

barnes could his bodey have been laid in 

the grave in Nauvoo or among the saints, he 

said he had vary peculiar feelings relative 

to recieving an honorable burial with his fathers 

he considered Nauvoo would be a burying 

place of the saints & should he die he considered 

it would be a great blessing to be buried with 

the saints & esspecially to be buried with his father 

yes he wanted to lie by the side of his father 

that when the trump of God should sound 

& the voice of God should say ye saints 

arise, that when the tomb should birst he 

could arise from the grave & first salute 

his father & say O my father, & his father 

say O my Son!! as they took each other by 

the heand he wished next to salute his brothers 

& sisters & then the Saints & he said it was 

upon this principle that the ancients were 

so particular to have an honorable burial with 

their fathers as in the case of Joseph, before his 

death he made his kindred promise to carry



 END_ENTRY his bones to the land of Canann & they did 

so they embalmed his body took it to the land 

of Canaan & buryed it with his fathers 

their is a glory in this that many do not 

comprehend. It is true that in the 

resurrrection that the bodies will be caught 

up to meet the Lord & the saints will all be 

brought together though they were scattered 

upon the face of the whole earth yet they 

would not as readily salute each other as 

though they lay down & rose up together 

from the same bed. To bring it to the under-

standing it would be upon the same principle 

as though two who were vary friends indeed 

should lie down upon the same bed at night 

locked in each other embrace talking of their 

love & should awake in the morning together 

they could immediately renew their 

conversation of love even while risings from 

their bed but if they were alone & in 

seperate apartments they could not as 

readily salute each other as though they 

were together. He remarked that should 

he live & have an opportunity of gathering 

his friends who had died together he intended 

to do it but if he should not live to do 

it himself he hoped that some of his frie

friends would. He wished all of the 

saints to be comforted with the victory 

they were to gain by the resurrection 

it is sufficient to encorage the saint to 

overcome in the midst of evry trial trouble 

& tribulation though thunders roar & earth

quakes bellow, lightnings flash & wars are 

upon evry hand yet suffer not a joint 

to tremble nor let not your heart faint

[FIGURE]





May 14, 1843 ~ Sunday





14th Sunday The meeting was opened 

by singing, & Prayer by w woodruff 

Then Joseph the Seer arose & said 

It is not wisdom that we should have all 

knowledge at once presented before us but 

that we should have a little then we can 

comprehend it. He then read the 

second epistle of Peter 1st ch 16 to last vers 

& dwelt upon the 19: vers with som remarks 

ad[d] to your faith knowledge &c. The principle 

of knowledge is the principle of Salvation 

the Principle can be comprehended, for 

any one that cannot get knowledge to be 

saved will be damned. The Principl of 

Salvation is given to us through the kno-

wledge of Jesus Christ. Salvation is 

nothing more or less than to triumph over 

all our enemies & put them under our feet 

& when we have power to put all enemies under 

our feet in this world & a knowledge to triumph 

over all evil spirits in the world to come then 

we are saved as in the case of Jesus he was 

to reign untill he had put all enemies under 

his feet & the last enemy was death



 

perhaps there are principle here that few 

men have thought of. No power ^person^ can have 

this Salvation except through a tabernacle



 END_ENTRY Now in this world mankind are naturly 

selfish, ambitious & striving to excell one 

above another while yet some are willing 

to build up others as well as themselves so in 

the other world their is a variety of spirits 

some who seek to excell, & this was the 

case with the devil when he fell he sought 

for things which were unlawful hence he was 

cast down & it is said he drew away many 

with him & the greatness of his punishment 

is that he shall not have a tabernacle this 

is his punishment. So the devil thinking to 

thwart the decree of God by going up & down 

in the earth seeking whome he may destroy 

any person that he can find that will yield to 

him he will bind ^him^ & take possession of the 

body & reign there glorying in it mightily not 

thinking that he had got a stolen tabernacle

& by & by some one of Authority will come 

along & cast him out & restore the tabernacle 

to his rightful owner but the bevil steals 

a tabernacle because he has not one of his own 

but if he steals one he is liable to be turned out 

of doors





Now their is some grand secrett here 

& keys to unlock the subject. Notwithstanding 

the Apostle exhorts them to make their calling 

add to their faith virtue, knowledge temperance 

&c yet he exhorts them to make their calling 

& election shure & though they had herd the 

audible voice from heaven bearing testimony 

that Jesus was the son of God yet he says 

we have a more sure word of Prophecy whare 

unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a 

light shining in a dark place. Now wharein 

could they have a more sure word of prophecy



 END_ENTRY for it is a decree of the Lord that evry tree fruit 

or herb bearing seed, should bring forth after its kind 

& cannot come forth after any other law or princi-

ple. Upon the same principle do I contend that 

Baptism is a sign, ordained of God for the 

believer in Christ to take upon himself in order to 

enter into the kingdom of God, "for except 

you are born of the water & the spirit you cannot 

enter into the kingdom of God, saith the Savior, as 

It is a sign of command which God hath set for 

man to enter into this kingdom of God those who 

seek to enter in any other way will seek in vain, for 

God will not receive them neither will the angels 

acknowledge their works as accepted, for they have 

not taken upon themselves those ordinances & signs 

which God ordained for man to receive in order to 

receive a celestial glory, & God has decreed that all 

that ^who^ will not obey his voice shall not escape the 

damnation of hell. What is the damnation of 

hell, to go with that society who have not obeyed 

his commands. Baptism is a sign to God, to Angels

to heaven that we do the will of God & their is 

no other way beneath the heavens whareby 

God hath ordained for man to come to God & any 

other cource is in vain. God hath decreed &

ordained that man should repent of all his sins & 

Be Baptized for the remission of his sins then he 

can come to God in the name of Jesus Christ in 

faith, then we have the promise of the Holy Ghost



What is the sign of the healing of the sick? 

the laying on of hands, is the sign or way 

marked out by James & the custom of the 

ancient saints as ordered by the Lord & we 

should not obtain the blessing by persuing any 

other course except the way which God has marked out.



What if we should attempt to get 

the Holy Ghost through any other means except 

the sign or way which God hath appointed, should 

we obtain it certainly not all other means would 

fail. The Lord says do so & so & I will bless so & so 

their is certain key words & signs belonging to 

the priesthood which must be observed in 

order to obtaine the blessings END_ENTRY The sign of Peter was, to repent & be baptized 

for the remission of sins, with the promise of the 

gift of the Holy Ghost & in no other way is 

the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained. Their is a 

difference between the Holy Ghost & the gift of the 

Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before 

he was baptized which was the convincing power 

of God unto him of the truth of the gospel, but 

he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost 

untill after he was baptized, & had he not taken 

this sign or [or]dinances upon him the Holy Ghost

which convinced him of the truth of God would 

have left him, untill he obeyed these ordin-

ances & received the gift of the Holy Ghost by the 

laying on of hands according to the order 

of God he could not have healed the sick or 

command an evil spirit to come out of a 

man & it obey him for the spirit might 

say to him as he did to the sons of Seava & 

Peter I know & Christ I know but who 

are ye



It matereth not whether we live long 

or short after we come to a knowlede of these princi-

ples & obey them. I know that all men will be 

damned if they do not come in the way which God 

has appointed



As concerning the resurrection I will 

merly say that all men will come from the grave 

as they lie down, whether old or young their 

will not be added unto ther stature one cubit neither 

taken from it. All being raised by the power of God 

having the Spirit of God in their bodies & not blood

Children will be enthroned in the presence of God 

& the Lamb with bodies of the same stature that 

were on earth. Having been redeemed by the 

Blood of the Lamb they will there enjoy a fulness 

of that light Glory & intelligence which is receiv-

ed in the Celestial kingdom of God. "Blessed are the 

dead who die in the Lord, for they rest from their END_ENTRY labours & their works do follow them



The speaker before closing called upon the vast 

assembly before him to humble themselves in faith 

before God, & in mighty Prayer & fasting to call 

upon his Holy name, untill the elements were 

purified over our heads & the earth sanctified under 

our feet that the inhabitants of this city may 

escape the power of the disease, pestilence & destroyer 

that rideth upon the face of the earth & that the 

holy spirit of God may rest upon this vast multitude



At the close of the meeting President Smith informed 

the congregation that he should attend to the 

ordinance of Baptism in the his ho river near his 

house at 2 oclock. And at the appointed hour 

the bank of the missisippi was lined with a multitude 

of people & President Joseph Smith went 

forth into the river & Baptized with his own 

hands about 80 persons for the remission of 

their sins & what added Joy to the scene the 

first person Baptized was Mr L.D. Wason a 

nephew of Sister Emma Smith the first of 

her kindred that have embraced the fulness of 

the gospel. At the close of this interesting scene 

the Administrator lifted up his hands towards 

heaven & implored the blessing of heaven ^God^ to 

rest upon the People, & truly the spirit of 

God did rest upon the multitude to the Joy &

consolation of our harts. After Baptism 

the congregation again repaired to the grove 

near the Temple to attend to the ordinance of 

Confirmation & notwithstanding president Smith 

had spoken in the open air to the people & stood 

in the water & baptized about 80 person about 50 

of those baptized received their confirmation 

under his hands in the after part of the day, &

during the intermission of these meetings their 

was probably as many more Baptized & confirmed 

for their Dead relatives at the Font By the Twelve

And those who wish for further information 

concerning the scenes of the Sabbath in Nauvoo

or any other day in the week I would say to all 

such come & see. W. Woodruff. END_ENTRY H. C. Kimball Baptized abot 40 in the font I assisted 

in confirming about 20. It was truly an interesting 

day

27 ^Sunday^ [FIGURE] This was an interesting day. A 

large assembly met in the grove near the Temple 

Br Amisa Lyman addressed the assembly & made 

many interesting remarks. He was followed by 

Joseph the Seer who made some edifying remarks 

concerning baptism for the dead. He said the Bible 

supported the doctrin, "why are ye baptized for 

the dead if the dead rise not &c" if their is one word 

of the Lord that supports the doctrin it is enough to mak[e] 

it a true doctrin. Again if we can baptize a man in

the Name of the Father of the Son & of the Holy Ghost 

for the remission of sins it is just as much our privilege 

to act as an agent & be baptized for the remission 

of sins for & in behalf of our dead kindred who have not 

herd the gospel or fulness of it. After meeting 

closed the congregation again assembled upon the 

bank of the river & Joseph the seer went into END_ENTRY the river & baptized all that came unto him &

I considered it my privilege to be baptized for 

the remission of my sins for I had not been 

since I first Joined the Church in 1833 I was 

then baptized under the hands of Elder Zerah 

Pulsipher therefore I went forth into the river 

& was Baptized under the hands of 

JOSEPH THE SEER & likewise did Elder 

J Taylor & many others & Joseph called 

upon me to assist him & I did so & went in & 

Baptized 12, & then Joseph lifted up his hands 

to heaven & blessed the people & the spirit of God 

rested upon the congregation we then again 

repaired to the place of meeting near the Temple & 

Elder Taylor & myself was confirmed by 

the laying on of hands we then commenced 

confirming others who had been baptized I 

confirmed about 20. Some remarks were made 

by Gen Bennett & Elder Taylor & the meeting 

closed.

Baptized 12 & confirmed 20

9th T[h]e Saints in Nauvoo assembled at the house 

of president Marks at an early hour in the mor-

ning to pay their last respeck to the body of 

Ephraim Marks son of President Marks who died 

on the evening of the 7th A large procession 

formed two by two & walked to the grove a large 

concorse assembled President Joseph Smith 

spoke upon the occasion with much feelings & inter

est among his remarks he said it is a vary solumn 

& awful time I never felt more solumn it calles 

to mind the death of my oldest brother who died in 

New York & my Youngest brother Carloss Smith who 

died in Nauvoo. It has been hard for me to live on

earth & see those young men upon whome we have lean-

ed upon as a support & comfort taken from us in 

the midst of their youth, yes it has been hard to 

be reconciled to these things I have sometimes felt 

that I should have felt more reconciled to have been 

called myself if it could have been the will 

of God, yet I know we ought to be still & know 

it is of God & be reconciled all is right it 

will be but a short time before we shall all in 

like manner be called. It may be the case 

with me as well as you. Some has supposed 

that Br Joseph could not die but this is a 

mistake it is true their has been times when 

I have had the promise of my life to accomplish 

such & such things, but having accomplish those 

things I have not at present any lease of my 

life & am as liable to die as other men END_ENTRY I can say in my heart that I have not done any 

thing against Ephraim Marks that I am sorry for 

& I would ask any of his companions if they 

have done any thing against him that they are 

sorry for or that they would not like to meet at 

the bar of God if so let it prove as a warning to 

all men to deal justly before God & with all men

then we shall be clear in the day of judgment

When we loose a near & dear friend upon whom 

we have set our hearts we can never feel the same 

afterwards knowing that if we set our hearts upon 

others they may in like manner be taken from us

President Smith made many other interesting 

remarks & left it for President Rigdon to close



President Rigdon arose & also said many interes-

ting [things] & among other said that when we see a princi-

ple that makes us the most Happy if we will cultivate 

that principle & practice it ourselves it will render others 

Happy for that course of conduct that pleases you will 

please others. I would say to the mo[u]rners that 

death has made his heaviest stroke at you for should 

he take either of the parents away from the rest 

of the family it would set them down in the king-

dom of God with their son Ephraim, the speaker 

remarked that the death of this young man had made 

a vacancy in his heart that nothing could fill untill 

it was filled by restoring the society of the same 

person in eternity which is the case in loosing any 

friend. All the remarks were vary appropriate that were 

made on the occasion. The Body was then conveyd 

to the grave in solemn silence & each as they pass-

ed by droped in a branch of evergreen into the grave 

the body was then coverd with earth which closed 

the scenery.



The City Council met at 2 oclock I stayed a litt

le season & came home with a hard head ake but 

not withstanding this illness I set out a bed of english 

strawburies & 150 stocks of english red raapberrys in 

my garden which closed the business of the {day} 

{We set} (3) {ponies loose} END_ENTRY April 10, 1842 ~ Sunday





April 10th Sunday 

[FIGURE] A plesant morning A large congregation 

of Saints met at the grove President William Law 

addressed the assembly for about 1 hour



Then Joseph the Seer arose in the power 

of God reproved & rebuked wickedness before the 

people in the name of the Lord God. He wished 

to say a few words to suit the condition of the general 

mass. ["]And I shall speak with authority of the 

priesthood in the name of the Lord God, which 

shall prove a savior of life unto life or of death 

unto death.



Notwithstanding this congregation profess to be 

Saints yet I stand in the midst of all characters 

and classes of men. If you wish to go whare God 

is you must be like God or possess the principles which 

God possesses for if we are not drawing towards God 

in principle we are going from him & drawing towa

rds the devil, yes I am standing in the midst of 

all kinds of people. Search your hearts & see if 

you are like God. I have searched mine & feel to 

repent of all my sins. We have theives among us 

Adulterers, liars, hypocritts, if God should speak 

from Heaven he would command you not to 

steal, not to commit Adultery, nor to covet, nor 

deceive but be faithful over a few things



As far as we degenerate from God we desend 

to the devil & looses knowledge & without knowle-

dge we cannot be saved & while our hearts are filled 

with evil & we are studying evil their is no room 

in our hearts for good or studying good, is not 

God good, yea then you be good, if he is faithful 

then you be faithful. Add to your faith virtue, to 

virtue knowledge, & seek for evry good thing

the Church must be cleansed & I proclaim 

against all iniquity. A man is saved no faster 

than he gets knowledge for it he does not get 

knowledge he will be brought into captivity by 

some evil power in the other world as evil 

spirits will have more knowlede & consequent

ly more power than many men who are END_ENTRY on the earth. hence it needs revelation to 

assist us & give us knowledge of the things of 

God. What is the reason that the Priest of 

the day do not get Revelation. They ask ownly 

to consume it upon their lust their hearts are 

corrupt & they cloke their iniquity by saying 

that their is no more Revelations. But if 

any revelations are given of God they are univers

ally opposed by the priest & Christendon at large 

for it reveals their wickedmess & abominations["]

many other remarks of interest were made 

by the speaker I truly felt in my own heart 

that it was a profitable meeting



on my return home I was soon met by one of 

my old school mates & neighbours by the name of 

Lewis Allen native of Avon Connecticut he had 

called to visit Nauvoo & inquire into the principles 

of the Latter Day Saints he herd Joseph the 

seer preach during the day & seemed much 

better satisfied than he expected, he spent the 

night with me & I lade before him the first 

principles of the Gospel

8th [FIGURE] I went to fishing with Father Richard

Smithies in the river ribble he is 70 years of age 

& is considered the greatest fisherman in the coun-

try. He fishes with the fly which is the greatest 

art in fishing ever introduced[.] his fish pole or rod 

was about 14 feet long sumthing like cane vary slender 

& delecate his long fine line made of hair & cat gut 

was wound around a small brass wheel with 

a little crank to it fastened to the but end of the 

pole the line then runs through half a dozen brass



 END_ENTRY rings or ilet holes fastened at a sutible distance 

along on the rod to the small end of it, one 

the end of the fine fish line is fastened 5 or 

6 artifishal flies about 2 feet apart these

are upon a small cat gut almost as small as 

a single hair, 25 or 30 feet of the line is unwond 

from the reel at the but of the rod running through 

the rings to the point the line is then flung upon 

the water the same as though it was tied at 

the end of the rod & the flies with a hook concealed 

in each fswims down the stream the trout 

instantly take it considering it the natural fly 

they are hooked as soon as they strike it if 

they are large trout & run they of their 

own accord unwind as much line as ^they^ want 

from the reel at the but of the pole or rod 

the fisherman does not pull the fish out 

of water on the bank by the pole but worries 

the fish in the water with the line untill 

he will not struggle then he draws him 

up to the shore by the line if he stands on 

the bank or to him of [if] he stands in the water 

he then takes a small hand net with a light 

pole 5 or 6 feet puts it under the fish & takes 

him vary delibeately out of the water, Father 

Smithies caught 7 trout & two Cheven in 

this way while we were with him. It was 

the first time I had seen the fly used in 

my life in the way of fishing it [I] was delighted

with it. the rod & line was so light & flung 

with such skill & dexterity that the trout 

are beguiled & whare ever they are are generally 

taken the fisherman has flies different for 

almost ever month calculated to imitate the 

flies that float upon the water at the time



 END_ENTRY they fish, these flies are made of the feathers 

of birds some of various Colors the trout will 

often take them before the natural fly I was 

much gratifyed with this days fishing. we

meal we spent the night at Mr Parkinson 6 m

We had a vary interesting time at the confere

Conference I shall ever attend at Gad Elm Chapel

I had quite a time in taking the parting hand with 

the multitude of Saints who were present, we 

closed our meeting without any disturbance from 

the mob who were present & was kept quiet by the



 END_ENTRY Policee who were present, but dressed in disguise





After Conference closed a scene followed not 

easily described, I never saw a time when I needed 

more wisdom in order to council in wrighteousness 

than on this occasion or during my travels among 

the Churches, for the Saints universally feel 

that the Judgments of God are near in this land 

& are anxious to gather with the Saints in Nauvoo 

as soon as possible but many are vary poor & see 

no door open as yet, & some are placed in all the 

perplexing circumstances that possible can be, & are 

floccking around me by scores at a time & asking 

council what to do. As soon as meeting closed multitu

des crouded around me, many hands were presented 

on evry side to bid me farewell, many calling for me 

to bless them before I leave them, others crying 

out do lay hands on me & heal me before you go. Br 

Woodruff I am turned out of Doors for my religion

what shall I do, I am all ready to go to Zion my wife 

wont go with me shall I go & leave her. My 

Husband beats me & turns me out of Doors because I 

have been Baptized I have got money enough to 

carry me & the children to Zion will you let me 

go without hime, Br Woodruff one word with 

you my Mother is over 80 years of age & has 

willed me £60 pounds at her Death but will not 

emigrate with me, now I want to go with the Saints

must I stay for her to die or may I go & leave her 

Br Woodruff I have sold my little place shall have 

£30 pounds tomorrow but must go out of the 

house into the street, this will not quite carry 

my family to America can you help me to a 

few pounds or tell me what to do. An Elder 

cries out how much longer must I preach In 

England before you will let me go to America, 

Br Woodruff cant you come & preach to us in 

Cheltenham. wont you go home & take some tea with 

me. My head is in great pain wont you heal me. 

I want you to consecrate these bottles of Oil before 

you go. Good by, Good by, Good by, God bless you 

Br Woodruff the friends are waiting a long time 

for you. Are you going I want a little council 

from you. Br Woodruff may I go to America 

with yoy. Say may we take an English Ship to



 END_ENTRY Nauvoo Via of Quebeck in Canida. Shall I be 

Justifyed if I have an opportunity of Going to miss 

of the opportunity for the purpose of tarrying 

a while for my mother. Will you write to me. 

Remember me to Mrs Woodruff (Margarett Morgan)

Good by, I have been waiting a long time to get a 

chance to speak to you:: THESE and a thousa

nd other questions were asked me in the term of 

an hour or more, & I needed as much wisdom 

as Solomon to be a councellor in the midst of such 

a scene, And which when I left the chapel 

many were still waiting for a little council upon a 

variety of subjects which they did not get for 

the want of time many parted with me with tears 

in their eyes, many of the Brethren & Sisters followed 

me to Turkey Hall whare I spent the night, & filled 

the house untill a late hour Begging council & 

instruction at my hand among whome was a 

Baptist Minister, who had just been baptized 

& ordained a Priest. In fine these sceneries of 

meeting in Conference & parting with the Saints 

cannot be described. The Saints contributed 

£2 pounds for my necessities. I wrote a letter

martered in America I met with a crouded con-

gregation of the Saints, & preached unto them, my 

mind is Deeply impressed with the necessity of urging 

the gathering of the Saints, this at the present time

Willford Woodruff Clerk

After meeting Dissmissed I spent about three 

hours in shaking hands with the Saints healing the 

sick, giving council, concerning a thousand questions 

& things that were presented before me by 

the multitude which surrounded me many were 

in tears as they parted from me, Nearly fifty saints 

came to me & wished me to take them to Zion when 

I had not means to take myself: I however gave 

Sister Foxal £5. pounds to make up enough to 

help her & her husband & children to the land of 

America, she had £30 pounds but not quite 

enough to help her family over, & she had used evry 

exhertion for six months by puting faith & works 

together to try to gather with the Saints, & this 

was a donation from Elder Edward Ockey who 

is imparting of his substance to help the poor Saints

It caused me peculiar feelings to part with these 

Saint & to meditate upon the fruits of my labours 

& what had followed in that field During 1840

The following is the sum Total represented in that region

& Blessed me far beyound my expectations 

for I am now privleged of thaving more 

than fifteen hundred Saints in this interes

ting field which I first opened one year 

ago the 5th of this present months, all of 

which have embraced the work since that 

Date many of which the Saints have gatherd to 

Zion from that region & the rest are anxious 

to go & ownly waiting for a door to be open for 

them. I have never seen so many saints 

receive the work of God in so short a time & 

so many ordained Elders, Priests, &c as on 

this occasion, & what adds much joy & conso

lation to my mind while reflecting upon this 

subject is that (with vary few exceptions) the 

Officers & members universally have maintained 

their integrity kept the faith & are faithfully 

passing through many trials for Christ sake





After Bidding the Multitude of Saints farewell 

I went to Elder Edward Ockey to spend the 

night. I was accompanied by Elders Richards 

Kington, & Kay. we had not been in the house but 

a short [time] before three of Edward Ockey's Brothers 

came into the house for the purpose of contending & 

having a contest with me. Because their Brother 

& sister had embraced the fulness of the gospel & 

was about to gather with the saints of God, to the 

land of Zion they manifested much wrath against 

me, & after conversing about 3 hours upon various 

subjects, During which time they brought railing 

accusation against us, & after Br Ockey had 

faithfully warned them & born faithful testimony 

unto his Brethren of the truth of the work of 

God & the fullness of the Gospel, they left the house 

& we were once more in peace, & after convers-

ing together untill the third wach of the night 

we retired to rest which closed the scenes 

of one of the busiest days of my life 2 miles

March 23rd I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep 

& after conversing several hours with Elders Richards 

Kington, Kay, & Ockey & others I was under the ne

cessity of taking the parting hand with the Saints in this 

region, & among others with Br Edward & Sister 

Ann Ockey, these are a Brother & sister of one family 

& the ownly ones of the Ockey family that have 

received the fulness of the gospel as they & their friends 

are popular & welthy they have had many trials to 

pass through in order to do the will of God maintain 

their faith & Integrity & prepair to gather with the 

Saints of God, for their Brothers are exceding mad 

against them. But Br Ockey has maintained his int

egrity like a man of God, when his Brothers has come against 

him in anger & abused him & the Servants of God that



 END_ENTRY were in his house he has boldly stood up in defence 

of the faith bore record of the truth of the 

work & faithfully warned his Brethren to 

obey the gospel, he is making evry preperation to 

gather with the Saints & help as many as he can to 

Do the same. Sister Ann appears willing to do the 

same. But has some fears that her Brothers will 

hender her getting ready & gathering with the 

saints she wishes me to Pray that God will 

deliver her. As I bid her farewell she put into 

my hands £0.5 A Crown & A Peace of paper containing 

the following lines. To my Dear Friend

Oh say not we are Parted

While our souls can meet in prayer



Whilst there is a throne of love

And one hope unites us there



When the first light of the morning

First tints the east with red



I pray that heavens best blessings

May be showerd on thy head



And when evening's lengthning shadows

Recall the hour of Prayer



There is no mercy that I crave

But thy Dear name is there



(Good Bye)

When from the friend we dearly love

Fate tels us we must part

By words we can but febly prove

The anguish of the heart 

[FIGURE]

And in soft words how'er sincere

Can half so much imply

As that suppressed & trembling tear

Which drowns the word good bye

The oceans may between us rool

And distant be our lot

Ah 'tho we part to meet no more

Dear Friend forget me not

To meet once more in council after a long seperation 

and having passed through many sore and grieveous 

trials exposing our lives & our characters to the slander 

and violence of wicked & murderous men, caused our hearts 

to swell with gratitude to God for his providential care 

over us - - - Elder Young opened the council by prayer

Elders B. Young H. C. Kimball and P. P. Pratt the comm-

ittee appointed about a year ago to secure a coppy right 

of the Book of Mormon in the name of Joseph Smith jr 

Presented the following certificate

of the said company

George Greenhill

Warehouse keeper of the Company of Stationers

The quorum voted that they accepted the labours 

of said Committee

Resolved that as the quorum of the Twelve have had 

nothing to do with the printing of the Book of Mormon

they will not now interfere with it, but that the said END_ENTRY on the flat would beet the saints on the Hill

Great God how such a thing looks that the saints

should be afraid of beating one another in the

election or being beat I would ask who built up

this city would steem boats landed here if the

saints had not come, or could you even the

speculators have soled their lands for any thing

here if the saints had not come they might have

sold for a few bare & wolf skins but not for

money, can these speculaters sell all their land

to the saints for a great price & then go away &

enjoy it somewhare els I tell you nay, for know

it ye people that Israel is here & they are the

head and not the tail & the people must learn it

all those who have gone from us have gone

from the head to the tail. But if any of you wish

to know how to have your bread fall butter

side up butter it both sides & then it will fall

butter side up. Uppose this work & it will roll

over you, when did this work ever stop since it

began never. The ownly thing the saints now

want to know is what does the Lord want of

us & we are ready to do it. Well then build the

temple of the Lord keep the law of God ye saints

& the hypocritt & Scroundral will flee out

of your midst & tremble for the fire of God

will be two hot for them, he made many

important remarks.





Elder Taylor followed

with an address upon political matters he traced

the history of governments for many centuries

& traced the form of governments from ancient

days to the present time He spoke of our Charters

& General Smith being a candidate for the

Presidential chair & we must do what we

can to electing him we will not be cowards



 END_ENTRY in this thing. A coward is like an Ostrich he will

hide his head under cover & leaves his body out in

sight to be seen as we pass along so cowards

here after will be called an Ostrich. He also made

some remarks concerning the building of the

Temple. Elder Young remarked that he should

visit those who did not pay up their tithing you

will want a blessing in the temple when it is done





President Smith remarked in relation to

those who give in property for the temple we

want it brought to the proper source that it

may be put on the Church Book So that in 

the endowment those whose names are on

book shall have the prefference. As to politics

I care but little about the Presidential Chair. I

would not give half as much for the office as I

would for the one I now hold, but as the world

have used the power of Goverment to oppress & persecute

us it is right for us to use it for the protection

of our rights. when I get hold of the eastern paper

& see how popular I am I am afraid myself that

I shall be elected, But if I should be I would

not say that your cause is just & I could not

do any thing for you. what I said in relation

to the annexation of texas is with some unpopular

the people are opposed to it. I will take this objection

away. the opposition is because it is filled up

with slavery, now I wish to turn the argument

it is the vary reason why it ought to be received

in order to watch over them of the greatest ^two^ evils

we should reject the greatest. The president of

Texas sayes if you do not receive us in the United

States we will go to the British this would certainly

be bad policy for this Nation the British are now through

out that whole country trying to bribe all they

can. How much better it is to be to a little expens



 END_ENTRY than to have the indians & British upon us & destroy

us all. we should grasp all the territory we can and I

know, much that I do not tell I have had bribes offered

me, but I have rejected them. The government

will not receive any thing from me they are

self sufficient, but they must go to Hell & work

out their own salvation with fear & trembling

as soon as texas was annexed I would liberate two

or three states & pay them for their slaves & let

them go to Mexico whare they are mixed blacks &c

I would also receive Canida & stand by them

& many other usful remarks He made

A collection was taken up to buy powder &

fuse rope about $60 dollars was recieved.

meeting closed & we returned to our homes





March 8, 1844 ~ Friday





March 8th I laboured in the garden or banking up

my house I met in council in the evening with

the presidency & twelve. spoke concerning a

candidate for the vice Presidency they had

nominated Gen Arlington Bennet not knowing

that he was a native of Ireland. the final decision

was for me to write to Col Solomon Copeland to

invite him to visit us & see if he would suffer his

name to run for the vice Presidency





March 9, 1844 ~ Saturday





9th [FIGURE] I spent the day in plowing & making

some garding I planted & sowed onions potatoes

set out straw buries & raspburies this is the

earliest time I ever undertook to make a garding



 END_ENTRY March 10, 1844 ~ Sunday





March 10th 1844 Sunday [FIGURES] I mailed a letter

to Sister Sarah B. Foss & wrote one letter to

Col Solomon Copeland. Brother King Follet

was buried this day under Masonic honors he was

killed while in a well by having a bucket of stone

fall onto him





A large assembly of the saints met at the temple

& was addressed by President Joseph Smith

upon one of the most important & interesting

subjects ever presented to the saints & the principles

presented were of the greatest importance to be

understood it was as follows the work & calling

& spirit Elias, Elijah, & Mesiah. The following

is a synopsis of the discourse





Their is a differance between the spirit & office

of Elias & Elijah it is the spirit of Elias I wish first

to speak of. And in order to come at the subject

I will bring some of the testimony from the

scripture & give my own, in the first place

suffice it to say I went into the woods to inq

wire of the Lord by prayer his will concern-

ing me, & I saw an angel & he laid his hands

upon my head & ordained me to be a priest

after the order of Aaron & to hold the keys

of this priesthood which office was to

preach repentance & Baptism for the remission

of Sins & also to baptise but was informed

that this office did not extend to the laying on

of hands for the giving of the Holy Ghost that

that office was a greater work & was to be given

afterwards but that my ordination was a

preparetory work or a going before which was the

spirit of Elias for the spirit of Elias was a going

before to prepare the way for the greater, which

was the case with John the Baptist he came

balling through the wilderness prepare ye the



 [##Joseph Smith-History 1:68-70##] END_ENTRY way of the Lord & make his paths strait

& they were informed if they could receive it it

was the spirit of Elias & John was vary particular

to tell the people he was not that light but was sent

to bear witness of that light. [##John 1:6-9##] He told the people

that his mission was to preach repentane & baptize

with water, but it was he that should come after

him that should baptise with fire & the Holy Ghost [##Matthew 3:11##]

if he had been an imposture he might have gone

to work beyound, his bounds & undertook to have

performed ordinances that did not belong to that

office & calling under the spirit of Elias. The

spirit of Elias is to prepare the way for a greater

revelation of God which is the priesthood of Elias

or the Priesthood of Aaron was ordained unto.

And when God sends a man into the world to prepare

for a greater work holds the keys of the power

of Elias it was called the doctrin of Elias even

from the early ages of the world. John's

mission was limited to preaching & baptizing but

what he done was legal & when Jesus Christ

came to any of John's deciples he baptized them

with fire & the Holy Ghost. We find the Apostles

endowed with greater power than John their

office was more under the spirit & power of 

Elijah than Elias. In the case of Philip when

he went down to Samaria was under the spirit

of Elias he baptized both men & women, when

Peter & John herd of it they went down

& lade hands on them & they received the

Holy Ghost this shows the distinction between

the two powers. [##Acts 8:12-17##] when Paul came to certain

deciples he asked if they had received the

Holy Ghost they said no, who baptized you

then we were baptized unto Johns Baptism



 [##Acts 19:1-6##] END_ENTRY No John did not baptized you for he did 

his work right, & so Paul went & baptized them 

for he knew what the true doctrin was & he 

knew that John had not Baptised them, & these 

principles and is strange to me that men who have 

red the scriptures of the New Testament are so 

far from it. What I want to impress upon your 

minds is the difference of power in the different 

parts of the Priesthood, so that when any man 

comes among you saying I have the spirit of Elias 

you can know whether he be true or fals, for 

any man that comes having the spirit & power of 

Elias he will not transend his bounds. John 

did not transend his bound but faithfully performed 

that part belonging to his office, and evry portion 

of the great building should be prepared right & 

assigned to its proper place, & it is necessary 

to know who holds the keys of power & who 

dont, or we may be likely to be decieved. That 

person who holds the keys of Elias hath a prep-

aritory work, But if I spend much more 

time in conversing about the spirit of Elias I 

shall not have time to do justice to the spirit & 

power of Elijah, this is the Elias spoken of in the

last days & here is the rock upon which many 

split thinking the time was past in the days of 

John & Christ & no more to be, but the spirit of 

Elias was revealed to me & I know it is true therefore 

I speak with boldness for I know varily my doctrin 

is true. Now for Elijah, the spirit power & 

calling of Elijah is that ye have power to hold the keys 

of the revelations ordinances, oricles powers & endow-

ments of the fulness of the Melchezedek Priesthood 

& of the kingdom of God on the Earth & to recieve, 

obtain & perform all the ordinances belonging to the 

kingdom of God even unto the sealing of the hearts



 END_ENTRY of the hearts fathers unto the Children & the hearts 

of the children unto the fathers even those who are 

in heaven. Malachi says I will send Elijah befor 

the great and dredful day of the Lord come & He 

shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children 

and the hearts of the Children to the Fathers lest I 

come & smite the earth with a curse. Now what I 

am after is the knowledge of God & I take my own 

course to obtain it, what are we to under^stand^ by this 

in the last days, in the days of Noah God destroyed 

the world by a flood & has promised to destroy 

it by fire in the last days but before it took place 

Elijah should first come & turn the hearts of 

the Fathers to the children &c. now comes the 

point what is this office & work of Elijah, it is 

one of the greatest & most important subjects that 

God has revealed, he should send Elijah to seal the 

children to the fathers & fathers to the children, now 

was this merely confined to the living to settle diffic-

ulties with families on earth, by no means, it was a 

far greater work Elijah what would you do if you 

was here? would you confine ^refer^ ^confine^ your work to the 

living alone. No. I would confine ^refer^ you to the 

scriptures whare the subject is manifest, ie without 

us they could not be made perfect nor we 

without them, the fathers without the children 

nor the children without the fathers. I wish 

you to understand this subject for it is important 

& if you will recieve it this is the spirit of Elijah 

that we redeem our dead & connect ourselves 

with our fathers which are in heaven & seal 

up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection 

& here we want the power of Elijah to seal 

those who dwell on earth to those which dwell 

in heaven this is the power of Elijah & the keys



 END_ENTRY of the kingdom of Jehovah. Let us suppose 

a case. suppose the great God who dwells in heaven 

should reveal himself to Father Cutler here 

by the opening heavens and tell him I offer 

up a decree that whatsoever you seal on earth 

with your decree I will seal it in heaven, you have 

power then, can it be taken of? No. Then what 

you seal on earth by the keys of Elijah is sealed in 

heaven & this is the power of Elijah, & this is 

the difference between the spirit & power of Elias 

and Elijah for while the spirit of Elias is a fore 

runner the power of Elijah is sufficient to make 

our Calling & Election sure & the same doctrin 

whare we are exhorted to go on on to perfection not 

laying again the foundation of repentance from

dead works but of laying on of hands, resurrection 

of the dead &c we cannot be perfect without the 

fathers, &c we must have revelations then 

& we can see that the doctrin of revelation 

as far transcends the doctrin of no revelation as 

knowlede is above ignorance for one truth revealed 

from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in 

exhistance. This spirit of Elijah was manifest in 

the days of the apostles in delivering certain ones 

to the buffitings of Satan that they may be saved in 

the day of the Lord Jesus, they were sealed by the 

spirit of Elijah unto the damnation of Hell untill the 

day of the Lord or revelation of Jesus Christ

Here is the doctrin of Election that the world 

have quarreled so much about but they do 

not know any thing about it. The doctrin 

that the Prysbeterians & Methodist have 

quarreled so much about once in grace always in 

grace, or falling away from grace I will say a word 

about, they are both wrong, truth takes a road 

between them both. for while the Presbyterian 

says once in grace you cannot fall the



 END_ENTRY Methodist says you can have grace to day, fall 

from it to morrow, next day have grace again & so 

follow it, but the doctrin of the scriptures & the 

spirit of Elijah would show them both fals & 

take a road between them both for according to the 

scriptures if a man has receive the good word of 

God & tasted of the powers of the world to come if 

they shall fall away it is impossible to renew them 

again, seeing they have crucified the son of God 

afresh & put him to an open frame shame, so their 

is a possibility of falling away you could not be 

renewed again, & the power of Elijah cannot 

seal against this sin for this is a reserve made 

in the seals & power of the priesthood, I will make 

evry doctrin plain that I present & it shall stand 

upon a firm bases And I am at the defiance of 

the world for I will take shelter under the 

broad shelter ^cover^ of the wings of the work in which 

I am ingaged, it matters not to me if all hell boils 

over I regard it ownly as I would the crackling 

of thorns under a pot. A murderer, for instance 

one that sheds innocent blood cannot have 

forgiveness. David sought repentance at the hand 

of God carefully with tears but he could ownly 

get it through Hell. he got a promise that his 

soul should not be left in Hell. Although David 

was a king he never did obtain the spirit & power 

of Elijah & the fulness of the Priesthood, & the 

priesthood that he received & the throne & kingdom 

of David is to be taken from him & given to another 

by the name of David in the last days raised up 

out of his linage. Peter refered to the same 

subject on the day of pentecost, but the multi-

tude did not get the endowment that Peter had 

but several days after the people asked what shall



 END_ENTRY we do. Peter says I would ye had done it ignorantly 

speaking of crucifying the Lord &c He did not say 

to them repent & be baptized for the remission 

of your sins but he said repent therefore & be 

converted that your sins may be blotted out when the 

times of refreshing shall come from the presence 

of the Lord. Acts III, 19 this is the case with murderers

they could not be baptized for the remission 

of sins for they had shed innocent Blood.



 

Again the doctrin or sealing power of Elijah is 

as follows if you have power to seal on earth & in 

heaven then we should be crafty, the first 

thing you do go & seal on earth your sons & daughters 

unto yourself & yourself unto your fathers in 

eternal glory, & go ahead and not go back, but 

use a little craftiness & seal all you can & when 

you get to heaven tell your father that what 

you seal on earth should be sealed in heaven

I will walk through the gate of heaven and claim 

what I seal & those that follow me & my council

The Lord once told me that what I asked for 

I should have. I have been afraid to aske to 

ask God to kill my enemies lest some of them 

should peradventure should repent. I asked a 

short time since for the Lord to deliver me 

out of the hands of the govornor of Missouri &

if it must needs be to accomplish it to take 

him away & the next news that came pouring 

down from their was Govornor Reynolds had 

shot himself, and I would now say beware O earth 

how you fight against the saints of God & shed innocent 

blood, for in the days of Elijah his enemies came 

upon him & fire was called down from heaven 

& destroyed them, the spirit of Elias is first, 

Elijah second, & Mesiah last. Elias is a fore runner 

to prepare the way, & the spirit & power of Elijah



 END_ENTRY is to come after holding the keys of power build[in]g 

the Temple to the cap stone, placing the seals of 

the Melchezedeck priesthood up on the house of Israel 

& making all things ready then Mesiah comes to 

his Temple which is last of all. Mesiah is above 

the spirit & power of Elijah for he made the world 

& was that spiritual rock unto Moses in the 

wilderness. Elijah was to come & prepare the way 

& build up the kingdom before the coming of 

the great day of the Lord. Although the spirit of 

Elias might begin it, I have asked of the 

Lord concerning his Coming & while asking, the 

Lord gave me a sign & said in the days of Noah 

I set a bow in the heavens as a sign & token that 

in any year that the bow should be seen the Lord 

would not come, but their should be seed time &

harvest during that year, but whenever you 

see the bow withdraw it shall be a token that their 

shall be famin pestilence & great distress among 

the nations. But I take the responsibility upon 

myself to prophesy in the name of the Lord, that 

Christ will not come this year as Miller has 

prophecyed, for we have seen the bow. And 

I also Prophecy in the name of the Lord that 

Christ will not Come in forty years & 

if God ever spake by my mouth he will not 

come in that length of time, & Jesus Christ 

never did reveal to any man the precise time that 

he would come, go & read the scriptures & you 

cannot find any thing that specifies the exact [time] he 

would come & all that say so are fals teachers. 

Their are some important things concerning the 

office of the Mesiah in the organization of the 

world which I will speak of hereafter. May 

God Almighty bless you & pour out his spirit upon you 

is the prayer of your unworthy servant Amen

24th March Sunday I met with the saints

at the Temple when I arived President Joseph

Smith was speaking the following is the substa-

nce of what I herd him say





I have been informed by two gentleman that

a conspiricy is got up in this place for the purpose

of taking the life of President Joseph Smith his

family and all the Smith family, the heads of the

Church, one of the gentleman will give his name to

the public & the other wishes it to be hid for the present

they will both testify to it on oath & make an affidavit

upon it the names of the persons revealed at the

head of the conspiracy are as follows (Chancy Higby

Dr Foster, Mr Jackson, Wm & Wilson Law)

And the lies that Higby has hatched up as a

foundation to work upon is he says that I had

mens heads cut off in Missouri & that I had a

sword run through the hearts of the people that I

wanted to kill & put out of the way. I wont

sware out a warrent against them for I dont

fear any of them they would not scare of[f] an

old setting hen. I intend to publish all the

iniquity that I know of. If I am guilty I am ready

to bear it their is honor among enemies I am

willing to do any thing for the good of the people.

I will give the names of one of the gentleman who

have divulged the plot his name is Eaton, he

will sware to it he is a bold fellow. Jackson

said a Smith should not be alive 2 weeks not over

two months any how. As concerning the

character of these men I will say nothing about

it now but If I hear any thing more from

them on this subject I will tell what I know

about them





Elder O. Spencer addressed the people

as follows. I thought of a figure ie if a physician



 END_ENTRY was going to dissect a body he would not begin at

the limbs but cut the head of[f] first. So the Adversary

has laid a plan to cut off the head of the Church

with the intention of scattering & destroying the

whole body. It was so in the days of Jesus

Christ the enemies sought to kill him that the

body might be destroyed, which was also the

case in the days of Elijah, Daniel, & many of the

ancients. I once herd a man say who was opposed

to this work that it might be true but it gave Jo

Smith power, true said I but if his power

be subordinate to the power of God it is right

If a man set up a kingdom by the power of God

then let others seek power from the same source

God sets up kingdoms & pulls down kingdoms

this makes men mad that will not submit to the

kingdom of God. We all know the result of the

power of Moses who was the representative of

God. Judging from what is past how will it be

when God sets up his kingdom in the last days

whether their is a conspiracy now or not I dont

know, but no doubt their will be if not know

for it has always been so. In the days of the

Nephites they had their Gadianton robers. I

have not any doubt but that the apostates will

join with the others wicked powers to try to put

down the power of God. and I am glad to

have the power of the kingdom of God tested

& when it is fully tried it will stand, I care

not what sacrifice I am called to make for such

a kingdom, if its friends, welth or even life at

the purchase of such a kingdom it is cheap, did the

ancient Apostles, Prophets or Saints who died pay two

much for that kingdom they did not. It is

necessary that men be put in possession of the



 END_ENTRY to do his work, for all the power the nations

will soon have is to destroy each other, for soon

nation will be against nation party against party

the rich against the poor & the poor against the rich

untill they are destroyed from under heaven

Tradition says the pope destroyed the church

of God. Rome followed the Church as long as

their was a saint & now you say the pope killed

fifty millions of Christians you lie sir their was

not a Christian on Earth, for when rome killed

the kChristians & would not have God rule they

wanted a pope & God gave them one or permitted

them to have one & he killed fifty millions. its

true but they were not Christians for they wer

already dead, but it was of their own number

ownly differed from them in sentiment here was

power with a vengance. But as soon as God sends

a man to use the power of God, then they are

afraid of power. now the world says the religion

of Jesus shed this blood & the bible &c but

men must be vary ignorant of the bible & the

religion of Jesus Christ too, to say such things for

it was for the want of religion & the bible that

caused the blood to be shed, for God Jesus

Christ nor religion had any more hand in it

than you had. The power of God & Jesus

Christ & religion would have saved if they had

had it.





President Joseph Smith again arose & said

In relation to the power over the minds of the

mankind which I hold, I would say it is in

consequence of the power of truth in the

doctrins which I have been an instrument in

the hands of God of presenting unto them & not

because of any compulsion on my part. I will

ask if I ever got any of it unfair. If I have



 END_ENTRY not reproved you in the gate. I ask did I ever

exercise any compulsion over any man. did I not

give him the liberty of disbelieveing any doctrin I

have preached if he saw fit, why do not my

enemies strike a blow at the doctrin, they

cannot do it, it is truth, And I am as the

voice of one crying in the wilderness repent

of your sins & prepare the way for the coming

of the son of Man, for the kingdom of God

has come unto you and henceforth the

ax is laid unto the root of the tree, and evry

tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, God

Almighty (and not Jo Smith) shall hew down &

cast it into the fire.)

a degree in this man & his company we thought it wisdom

to omit it on this occasion. We did so & retired & went

at least had broke loose. the Saints were strengthened seeing

that they were not of the world but the world hated them 

& we also went our way rejoicing that we were counting 

worthy to partake of thes things. We clensed our feet

by the way side as a testimony against Mr Pitt for rejecting

our testimony, & forbiding, & hindering, others from Entering

into the kingdom of God. may the will of God be done conserning 

that man, I pray that we may ever be reconciled to his 

will in all things. We walked to Froom hill & found Br

 END_ENTRY Reflections





From Adam man decended & prospered & blessed

untill he polluted the earth by sin & wickedness to that 

degree that God destroyed the whole world by a flood 

except 8 souls & they went forth & again peopled the earth

& was always blessed when they kept the Commandments 

of God & was cursed when they broke them. God blessed 

Abram & made Covenants with him & his seed. Though 

Israel was in slavery as it were under Pharrio yet when 

they cryed unto God & was humble God raised up

Moses & delivered them & cursed the Egyptian nation

& overthrew them, God overthrew the Canaanite 

& gave the land to Israel. [##Exodus 3##] Nation after Nation has 

risen flourish & fallen from generation to generation 

Babylon the excellency of the Chaldeans, & the glory of 

kingdoms was in her turn lade in the dust, & while 

the curse of God rested upon many nations for their 

sins & for Israel's sake. Israel forgot her God & 

turned to Idols, & proved the Lord to be equal in 

all his ways by scattering Israel to the four winds 

of heaven overthrowing Jerrusalem laying her pallaces

Synnagogues, & Temples, in the dust to be trodden down 

by the gentiles while Judah was driven like the dumb 

Ass under his burthen scattered among all nations as corn 

was sifted in a sive The gentile nations took her lands 

was grafted in whare Israel was broaken of & partook 

of the fatness of her olive tree & for a short season 

broat forth her fruit, then Rome arose & Greece 

in her turn have both spread themselves like a green 

bay tree & strove to have their branches reach to 

heaven while built upon Judah ruin, who at the 

same time is recieving double at the hand of God for 

all his sins, Greece & Rome in ther turn fall to the ground, 

& out of Rome comes forth ten kingdoms who are now 

struggling for the mastery to sway the septure oer the 

earth, But in vain, in vain, do ye strive O! ye gentiles 

for this thing, ye are ownly fuel for the fire & tinder 

for the Breath of the Almighty. Ye have not continued 

in the goodness of God neither have ye sought to recover 

Israel. WO, WO, WO, unto you Rome for you are 

the mother of harlots & Wo unto all your daughte

rs England & America not excepted, your destru

ction is sure, your condemnation lingereth not & 

your Damnation slumbereth not, for you are all 

drunk with the Blood of Saints you have spoiled 

Judah & Ephram you have trodden dow[n] But he 

will rise again & fullfill the word of God on thee!!

at the conference in Commerce Illinois in the United States

June 26, 1840 ~ Friday





26th We took the Omnibus at the Junktion & rode to 

Lane end at the Staffordshire Potterries Via Wolverhamp

ton & Stafford 38 miles. It would be a difficult task 

to give a description of the Country from Birmingham to 

Wolverhampton. I never saw any thing that comes so 

near the description of the Lake of fire & Brimstone 

spoken of by the Revelator John as several miles of 

that country for it is one universal mass of coal pits & 

Iron mines & while thousands of human beings are



 END_ENTRY under ground at work in the midst of fire, Brimston, 

Sulpher, Gas & Cole &c. the whole face of the earth & 

heavens air & horizon, men, women, & houses, are 

filled & covered with the composition of fire, cinders

Gas, sut, & smooke of their miserry & labours that 

assended up out of their piles, firnesses, & pitts from 

day to day & from year to year. in fine, it is more 

like Hell in comparrison than any place I have as 

yet visited. (Uncommon) A boy by the name of 

Thomas Skelsey 15 years of age is becomeing quite noted 

between Wolverhampton & Burslem by following 

the coaches or omnibus on foot & keeps pace with the them 

the whole distance, he runs about 40 miles in 6 hours, he 

has run through & returned in one day making 80 

miles in about 12 hours when he gets weary he 

takes hold of a strap on the hind end of the Coach with 

his hands but runs as usual. On one occasion he 

run 14 miles in one hour & fife minutes he is a poor 

boy & his ownly object is to get a living by recieving 

what money the passengers saw fit to give him about one 

shilling per day he does this running with bare feet on 

accadamized rodes.





We called upon the Saints at Lane end from thence to 

Stoke & felt truly to rejoice to once more meet with 

the Saints in this region. We Preached in the evening 

at Stoke had an interview with Elder Cordon spent the night 

at Stoke distance of the day 40 mile





June 27, 1840 ~ Saturday





27 [FIGURE] I had an interview with Elder G. A. Smith & I 

wrote a letter with Br G. A. Smith & T. Turley to President 

Joseph Smith jr I spent the day in Burslem. I herd a 

Letter wrote read from Sister Tailor in Commerce 

giving an account of the Conference in that place. 70 

were Baptized. Elders Hide & Page were set apart 

to visit the Jews at Palestine. The President of the 

United States had rejected the Petition of the Latter 

Day Saints to have their wrongs redressed, & as the 

Judges, Governors, & President of the United States

had rejected the Saints & turned a deaf ear to 

their cries, the Saints have now appealed to the highest 

tribunal even the Court of HEAVEN & called 

upon God as their deliverer. May the Lord spedily answer 

their Prayers I Pray. I spent the night a[t] Mr Battleby.





June 28, 1840 ~ Sunday





28th Sunday we held a Camp meeting at Stoke

we had a large Congregation Elders G. A. Smith T Turley, 

& A Cordon Preached in the fore part of the day



 END_ENTRY than to hear the voice of God saying this is 

my beloved son &c Now for the secret & grand 

[FIGURE] key, though they might hear the voice of God 

& know that Jesus was the son of God this woudd 

be no evidence that their election & calling 

& election was made shure that they had 

part with Christ & was a Joint heir with 

him, they then would want that more 

sure word of Prophecy that they were sealed 

in the heavens & had the promise of eternal 

live in the kingdom of God then having this 

promise sealed unto them it was as an anchor 

to the soul sure & steadfast though the thun-

ders might roll, & lightnings flash & earthquakes 

bellow & war gather thick around yet this 

hope & knowledge would support the soul 

in evry hour of trial trouble & tribulation 

Then knowledge through our Lord & 

savior Jesus Christ is the grand key [FIGURE] 

that unlocks the glories & misteries of 

the kingdom of heaven. Compair this 

principle once with Christondom at the present 

day & whare are they with all their 

boasted religion piety & sacredness while 

at the same time they are crying out 

against Prophets Apostles, Angels Revelations 

Prophesyings, & visions &c. why they are 

Just ripening for the damnation of hell, they 

will be damned for they reject the most

glorious principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ 

& treat with disdain & trample under foot 

the main key that unlocks the heavens 

& puts in our possession the glories of the 

celestial world. Yes I say such will be damned 

with all their professed godliness



 END_ENTRY Then I would exhort you to go on & continue 

to call upon God untill you make your calling 

& election sure for yourselves by obtaining 

this more sure word of Prophesey & wait 

patiently for the promise untill you obtain it 

Many other vary useful remarks were made 

on the occasion By Joseph the Seer





Elder G. A. Smith followed with a few remarks 

I also followed him & meeting closed for 

one hour, & we met again. I opened meeting 

& spoke upon revelation obeying the commandments 

by building the Nauvoo House 

was followed By G. A. Smith on the same subject 

Elder Lorenzo Snow then spoke sumwhat 

lengthy concerning his mishion to England which 

was interesting then our meeting closed





we all rode to Lima & took supper with Calvin 

Bebe & while we were conversing with Br 

Joseph & Br Morley Br Joseph made the 

following remarks. The way to get along in 

any important matters was to gather unto 

yourself wise men experienced & aged men 

to assist in Council in all times of trouble 

handsome men are not oft wise & strongminded 

men but the strength of a strong minded 

man will create corse features like the rough & 

strong bough of the oak. You will always 

discover in the first glance of a man in the outlines 

of his features sumthing of the mind of the 

man





Excitement has almost become the 

essens of my life when that dies away I feel 

almost lost when a man is reigned up contin-

ually by excitement he becomes strong &



 END_ENTRY gains power & knowledge but when he relaxes 

for a season he looses much of his power 

& knowledge. But in all matters temporal or 

spiritual Preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ 

or in leading an army to battle victory almost 

entirely depends upon good order & moderation 

(in going to battle moove slow dress up into a line 

& though your enemy rush upon you with fury 

meet them slow but firmly let not confusion 

or terror seize your breast but meet them 

firmly & strike a heavy blow & conquer.



A man can bear a heavy burdben by practice 

& continueing to increase it. The inhabitants 

of this continant anciently were so constituted 

& were so determined & persevering either 

in righteousness or wickedness that God 

visited them immediately either with great 

Judgments or blessings. But the present generation 

if they were going to battle if they Got any 

assistance from God would have to obtain it 

it by faith

[FIGURE] 22 May I have had for several days 

past some conversation with a number 

of the brethren concerning building a hous 

for myself & family. As I had spent most of 

my time in the vineyard for the last ten years 

& would probably spend much of my time 

to come in the same way I desired to have a 

house for my family to abide in & be comfortable 

in my absence several of the brethren proffer[ed] 

to assist me to brick & other materials & help me 

put it into a house Br John Fidoe would 

superintend the building, so on this 22nd of May 

we went on to the ground & staked out the 

ground for my house the dimentions of which 

are as follows laid out in Lot No 1 in Block 

106 in the City of Nauvoo frunting Durfee

27th A, rainey day I arose sick in the 

morning In consequence of hard labor 

& being heted the day before I was confined 

to my bed the fore part of the day 

In the afternoon I met in Council with 

the Twelve & first Presidency when the 

case of Benjamin Winchester was brought 

up on trial for improper conduct slandering 

the caints in Philadelphia for rejecting 

the council of Hiram, Joseph, & the Twelve 

& tearing to peaces the saints instead of building 

up Hyrum plead for mercy, Joseph for 

Justice, & the Twelve decided according to 

testimony, & in all we had an interesting time 

Elder winchester was refractory & out of 

order, Joseph wished the Twelve or President 

of the quorum to call the house to order 

Several Letters were read touching the subject 

after which Elder Winchester made a lengthy



 END_ENTRY speach trying to justify himself was followed 

by President Hyram Smith plead in behalf of 

winchester on the side of mercy Elder George 

J. Adams gave his testimony against winchester

then Elder Winchester followed Adams & 

both spoke sever[al] times then President Joseph 

Smith arose & rebuked Elder Winchester in 

the sharpest manner said he had a lying 

spirit & had lied about him & told him of many 

of his errors after hearing the testimony Elder 

B Young President of the quorum of the Twelve 

said he had made up his mind & his decision was 

that Elder Winchester should give up his licence & 

cease Preaching untill he should reform, President 

H Smith said he should not like to have such a 

decision given without another trial & give Elder 

Winchester a chance to get more testimony if 

he could, President Young said he should then 

prefer to have case turned over to the High Council

President Joseph Smith said it was not the 

business of the High Council they could not try 

him it belonged to the Twelve & them alone 

for it was concerning matters abroad & not 

in Nauvoo. The high Council was to trye 

cases that belong to the City & the Twelve to 

regulate the churches & Elders abroad in all 

the world & Elder winchester case comes 

under the Jurisdiction of the Twelve & them alone 

President H Smith urged that the case should 

be put off untill tomorrow President J. Smith said 

the case might be put off untill tomorrow at 10 oclok 

if it would do any body any good. President 

B. Young arose & spoke in the majesty of his 

calling & among other remarks said his 

mind was made up & the remarks of Brother

Hyrum or of Br Joseph had not altered 

it as for himself he would not sit upon the 

case another day he considered it an insult 

upon his office & calling as an apostle of Jesus 

Christ & he would not bear it as for the rest of 

the Twelve [they] might do as they pleased as for 

himself he would not do it Benjamin winchester 

has despised & rejected the Council of the 

presidency & the Twelve had said they had no 

Jurisdiction over him in Philadelphia & to say 

whare he should go &c but he & others will find 

their is power in the Twelve we know through 

whom we have received our power & who 

are our benefactors & we are thankful for 

it Benjemin Winchester has never for the first 

time received our Council but has gone 

contrary to it no ^one^ is safe in his hands he 

calls Hiram an old granny & slanders evrybody 

he says their is a contradiction between Hiram 

& the Twelve, their is no Contradiction between 

us & Hiram is there Br Hiram, (Hiram answers 

No) After B Young closed President J. Smith 

said he would give us a little counci[l] if we saw 

fit to except it, he thought it proper for us to 

silence elder winchester take his lisence & 

have him come to Nauvoo & if he would not 

do that let him go out of the Church, it 

was then Mooved & seconded that Elder 

winchester be silenced & give up his lisence 

& come with his family to Nauvoo which was 

carried unanimously

& said that in all our councils esspecially 

while on trial of any one we should see &
